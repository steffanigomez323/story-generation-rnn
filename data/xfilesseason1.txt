"THE FOLLOWING STORY IS INSPIRED BY ACTUAL DOCUMENTED ACCOUNTS"

SCENE 1
COLLUM NATIONAL FOREST, NORTHWEST OREGON
(A woman runs through the forest, grunting as she trips and stumbles over logs and rocks. She is wearing a nightgown and runs through the foliage. She falls over a tree root and stumbles into a small clearing. A loud roaring starts and the wind grows stronger. She looks up to see a light growing, shining through the trees. A silhouette steps out of the light, walking towards her. The leaves around her begin swirling up in a circle, like they are in the center of a tornado. The figure stands over her as the light engulfs them both. Morning. The girl is face-down on the ground, dead. Officials walk around, murmuring to each other. The assistant coroners lean over the body as coroner John Truitt and Detective Miles walk over to the body.)

JOHN TRUITT: I put the time of death between eight and twelve hours ago. No visible cause, no sign of battery or sexual assault. All we have is this.

(He pulls up the back of her nightgown to reveal two small bumps on her lower back. Miles looks at them.)

MILES: Can we turn her over?

(They do so. Miles stands.)

Karen Swenson.

ASSISTANT CORONER: Is that a positive ID?

DETECTIVE MILES: She went to school with my son.

(He walks away as Truitt stands.)

JOHN TRUITT: Would that be the class of '89, detective? It's happening again isn't it?

(Miles keeps walking.)




SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Agent Dana Scully walks up the stairs and around to a desk where a woman sits.)

SCULLY: Agent Dana Scully.

(She continues through a group of offices and down a hallway. Reaching the door to Section Chief Blevins' office, she knocks.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: Come in.

(Scully walks in and sees Blevins sitting at his desk.)

Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice. Please...

(He motions for her to sit down, which she does. A man smoking a cigarette leans against a file cabinet. He walks around to behind Blevins and leans against the wall. Another man sits next to Blevins.)

We see you've been with us just over two years.

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

SCOTT BLEVINS: You went to medical school but you chose not to practice. How'd you come to work for the F.B.I.?

SCULLY: Well, sir, I was recruited out of medical school. Um, my parents still think it was an act of rebellion, but, uh... I saw the F.B.I. as a place where I could distinguish myself.

THIRD MAN: Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder?

SCULLY: Yes, I am.

(Blevins and the man look at each other.)

THIRD MAN: How so?

SCULLY: By reputation. He's an Oxford educated Psychologist, who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult, that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988. Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crimes section. He had a nickname at the academy... Spooky Mulder.

(She smiles at the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who gives no response.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: What I'll also tell you is that Agent Mulder has developed a consuming devotion to an unassigned project outside the bureau mainstream. Are you familiar with the so-called "X-Files?"

SCULLY: I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena.

SCOTT BLEVINS: More or less. The reason you're here, Agent Scully, is we want you to assist Mulder on these X-Files. You will write field reports on your activites, along with your observations on the validity of the work.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stubs out his cigarette.)

SCULLY: Am I to understand that you want me to debunk the X-Files project, sir?

SCOTT BLEVINS: Agent Scully, we trust you'll make the proper scientific analysis. You'll want to contact Agent Mulder shortly. We look forward to seeing your reports.

(The elevator rings and the door slides open. Scully steps out into the basement and comes to an office secluded in the back. She knocks on the door.)

MULDER: Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's most unwanted.

(She opens the door to see Agent Fox Mulder sitting at his desk, going over some slides. Walking slowly to him, she sees various pictures of UFO's and a poster that reads "I Want to Believe" with a UFO on it. He looks at her.)

SCULLY: Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully, I've been assigned to work with you.

(He shakes her hand.)

MULDER: Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who did you tick off to get stuck with this detail, Scully?

SCULLY: Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard a lot about you.

MULDER: Oh, really? I was under the impression... that you were sent to spy on me.

(He smiles.)

SCULLY: If you have any doubt about my qualifications or credentials, th...

(He stands and takes out a paper from a pile with his telephone as a paperweight.)

MULDER: You're a medical doctor, you teach at the academy. You did your undergraduate degree in physics.

(He takes off his glasses and looks at the paper.)

"Einstein's Twin Paradox, A New Interpretation. Dana Scully Senior Thesis." Now that's a credential, rewriting Einstein.

SCULLY: Did you bother to read it?

MULDER: I did. I liked it.

(He takes a slide canister and puts it into the slide projector.)

It's just that in most of my work, the laws of physics rarely seems to apply.

(He walks past her and turns off the lights. She glares at him slightly.)

Maybe I can get your medical opinion on this, though.

(He presses a button on the control and a slide comes up on the viewscreen of Karen Swenson, face-up.)

Oregon female, age twenty-one, no explainable cause of death. Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.

(He changes the slide to that of the two bumps on her back.)

There are, however, these two distinct marks on her lower back. Doctor Scully, can you ID these marks?

SCULLY: Needle punctures, maybe. An animal bite. Electrocution of some kind.

(She walks up to the viewscreen. He changes the slide to that of a molecular diagram.)

MULDER: How's your chemistry? This is the substance found in the surrounding tissue.

SCULLY: It's organic. I don't know, is it some kind of synthetic protein?

MULDER: Beats me, I've never seen it before either.

(The next slide is of a boy face-down on railroad tracks, his shirt lifted in the back.)

But here it is again in Sturgis, South Dakota.

(The final slide if of a close-up of another set of bumps.)

And again in Shamrock, Texas.

SCULLY: Do you have a theory?

MULDER: I have plenty of theories.

(He walks over to her.)

Maybe what you can explain to me is why it's bureau policy to label these cases as "unexplained phenomenon" and ignore them. Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?

(He whispers the last few words eerily and she smiles.)

SCULLY: Logically, I would have to say "no."

(He nods, having expected that answer.)

Given the distances needed to travel from the far reaches of space, the energy requirements would exceed a spacecraft's capabilties th...

MULDER: Coventional wisdom. You know this Oregon female? She's the fourth person in her graduating class to die under mysterious circumstances. Now, when convention and science offer us no answers, might we not finally turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?

SCULLY: The girl obviously died of something. If it was natural causes, it's plausible that there was something missed in the post-mortem. If she was murdered, it's plausible there was a sloppy investigation. What I find fantastic is any notion that there are answers beyond the realm of science. The answers are there. You just have to know where to look.

MULDER: That's why they put the "I" in "F.B.I." See you tomorrow morning, Scully, bright and early.

(He walks back over to his desk and sits down.)

We leave for the very plausible state of Oregon at eight A.M.

(She smiles and walks out.)




SCENE 3
AIRPLANE TO OREGON
(The drink cart passes Mulder, who is lying down across a row of seats, sleeping, headphones in his ears. Scully is sitting nearby, wearing glasses and flipping through newspaper clippings of the dead teenagers. People are murmuring in the back, but the sounds of their voices are covered by the jet engines. Scully focuses on the name "Dr. Nemman." The overhead loudspeakers rings.)

PILOT: I would like to ask all passengers to fasten their seatbelts, as we're about to make our descent...

(Scully starts putting her things away when the plane starts shaking violently. People scream and things are tosses about as Scully grabs on to her seat. She looks at Mulder, who is awake now but still lying down in the seats passively. The plane finally is brought under control and she sighs in relief. He turns over and looks at her.)

MULDER: This must be the place.




SCENE 4
BELLEFLEUR, OREGON
(Driving down a long road, they pass a sign that reads "Welcome to Bellefleur, Oregon." Scully is reading the files and Mulder is eating sunflower seeds while driving.)

SCULLY: You didn't mention yesterday, this case has already been investigated.

MULDER: Yeah, the FBI got involved after the first three deaths when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence. Our boys came out here, spent a week, enjoyed the local salmon which, with a little lemon twist, is just to die for, if you'll pardon the expression. Without explanation, they were called back in. The case was reclassified and buried in the X-Files, till I dug it up last week.

SCULLY: And you found something they didn't.

MULDER: Mmm. (as if to say "yes.")

SCULLY: The autopsy reports of the first three victims, show no unidentified marks or tissue samples. But those reports were signed by a different medical examiner than the latest victim.

MULDER: That's pretty good, Scully.

SCULLY: Better than you expected or better that you hoped?

MULDER: Well... I'll let you know when we get past the easy part.

(She laughs.)

SCULLY: Is the medical examiner a suspect?

MULDER: We won't know that until we do a little gravedigging. I've arranged to exhume one of the other victims' bodies to see if we can get a tissue sample to match the girl's. You're not squeamish about that kind of thing, are ya?

SCULLY: I don't know. I've never had the pleasure.

(The radio starts flipping through channels rapidly, various sounds blaring. As Mulder tries to adjust it, the clock starts changing as well. The radio becomes a high-pitched screeching and Scully covers her ears. Mulder looks up to the sky.)

What's going on?

(Mulder pulls the car over to the side of the road and turns it off. He and Scully both get out. Mulder goes to the trunk, moves a briefcase, pulls out a can of pink spray paint, and walks over to where the occurance began. As Scully watches in wonder, he marks a giant "X" on the ground, then tosses the spray paint can back into his trunk. He moves the briefcase back on top of the can and closes the trunk.

What the hell was that about?

MULDER: Oh, you know... probably nothing.

(He gets back in the car.)




SCENE 5
COASTAL NORTHWEST OREGON; MARCH 7, 1992
(After driving through town, the agents arrive at the cemetery. Getting out, they see a number of men standing around, along with a crane. John Truitt and his assistant walk over to Mulder and Scully.)

JOHN TRUITT: Mister Mulder, John Truitt, County Coroner's Office.

MULDER: Yeah, hi.

(They shake hands.)

This is Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Hi.

(She and Truitt shake hands.)

MULDER: How soon can we get started?

(Scully and the assistant shake hands as well.)

SCULLY: Hello.

JOHN TRUITT: We're ready to go.

MULDER: Oh great.

JOHN TRUITT: Okay, Vinnie!

(The crane starts up as the four walk up the hill.)

MULDER: Were you able to arrange for a, uh... an examination facility?

JOHN TRUITT: I think we got something for you...

(A man and his teenage daughter pull up to the site.)

JAY NEMMAN: Excuse me!

MULDER: Ah...

(They turn around and look at the man.)

JAY NEMMAN: Excuse me!

(He starts towards them angrily but turns around and moves his daughter back to the passenger's side.)

No. Please stay in the car... let me handle this. I just want to talk to them.

(The girl gets into the car. The man walks over to the four officials.)

I just don't know who you people think you are. You just think you can come up here, and do whatever you damn well please, don't you?

MULDER: I'm sorry, you are...

JAY NEMMAN: I'm Doctor Jay Nemman. I'm county medical examiner.

MULDER: Surely, you must have been informed of our intentions to come up here.

JAY NEMMAN: No, uh, no. We've been away.

MULDER: Oh, oh. Well, that answers the question that we had. Why you hadn't done the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson. You're aware of the tissue sample that was taken from the girl's body.

JAY NEMMAN: Wha... wha... what is the insinuation here? Are you saying that I missed something in those other kids' exams?

SCULLY: We're not insinuating anything, sir.

JAY NEMMAN: Wait a minute.

(The group turns back, but Nemman grabs Mulder's arm and spins him around.)

Wait a minute, see, well I think you are. And if you're making an accusation, then you'd better have something to back it up.

(His daughter gets out of the car.)

THERESA NEMMAN: Daddy, please, let's just go home.

(Jay motions for Theresa to wait.)

Let's go home, please.

(Nemman glares at Mulder, then gets back in the car and drives off.)

MULDER: Guy obviously needed a longer vacation.

(They start back up the hill. They reach the gravesite and the crane starts scooping out the dirt above the coffin. Scully is reading from the file loudly because the crane's whirring is very loud.)

SCULLY: Ray Soames was the third victim. After graduating high school, he spent time in a state mental hospital treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.

MULDER: Soames actually confessed to the first two murders. He pleaded to be locked up but he couldn't produce any evidence that he committed the crimes. Did you happen to read the cause of death?

SCULLY: Exposure. His body was found in the woods after escaping the hospital.

MULDER: Missing for only seven hours in July. How does a twenty-year-old boy die of exposure on a warm summers night in Oregon, Doctor Scully?

WORKER: I got it.

(Two men help pull out the coffin as it is being lifted out by a harness. Suddenly, one of the straps breaks and the coffin starts rolling down the hill.)

Look out!

(As it hits the ground, the people jump, startled. They run down to the coffin as it crashes up against a tombstone, stopping it. The coffin has been broken open. Mulder goes to open it but Truitt grabs his arm.)

JOHN TRUITT: This isn't official procedure.

MULDER: Really?

(Mulder opens it anyway and sees a desecated, mummified grayish body lying in the coffin. While it is unclear exactly what this was, it is definitely not human. The arms are very long and the body is thin as well. The agents and workers gasp and cover their mouths, nauseous. Mulder stands and looks at Scully, who is kneeling.)

It's probably a safe bet Ray Soames never made the varsity basketball team.

(He turns to Truitt.)

Seal this up, right now! Nobody sees or touches this. Nobody!

(Truitt slams the lid shut.)




SCENE 6
10:56 P.M.
(Scully is dressed in her doctor's garb as Soames is laid out on the table. Mulder is taking pictures with a flashbulb.)

MULDER: This is amazing, Scully. You know what this could mean? It's almost too big to even comprehend.

SCULLY: Subject is a hundred and fifty-six centimeters in length, weighing fifty-two pounds in extremis. Corpse is in advance stages of decay and desiccation. Distinguishing features include large ocular cavities, oblate cranium... indicates subject is not human. Could you point that flash away from me, please?

(Mulder puts the camera away.)

MULDER: If it's not human, what is it?

SCULLY: It's mammalian. My guess is it's a chimpanzee or something from the ape family, possibly an orangutan.

MULDER: Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soames' grave? Try telling that to the good townsfolk or to Ray Soames' family. I want tissue samples and x-rays. I'd like blood type and toxicology and a full genetic work-up.

SCULLY: You're serious?

MULDER: What we can't do here, we'll order to go.

SCULLY: You don't honestly believe this is some kind of an extraterrestrial? This is somebody's sick joke.

MULDER: We can do those x-rays here, can't we? Is there any reason we can't do them right now? I'm not crazy, Scully. I have the same doubts you do.




SCENE 7
SCULLY'S HOTEL ROOM
(The time is 4:37. Scully is typing on her laptop while listening to a recording she made earlier. There is an x-ray of Soames' head with the nasal cavity circled taped to the lamp.)

SCULLY ON TAPE RECORDER: Official laboratory inspection of the body and x-ray analysis confirms homologous but possibly mutated mammalian physiology. However, does not account for small unidentified object found in subject's nasal cavity. A grey metallic implant form...

(She stops the tape and picks up a small tube containing a gray metallic object. There is a knock on the door.)

SCULLY: Who is it?

MULDER: Steven Spielberg.

(She smiles and opens the door. Mulder leans up against the doorway in jogging clothes and wearing a baseball cap backwards.)

I'm way too wired. I'm going for a run, you want to come?

SCULLY: Pass.

MULDER: You figure out what that little thing up Ray Soames' nose is yet?

SCULLY: No...

(She yawns.)

And I'm not losing any sleep over it. Good night.

(She closes the door and looks at the x-ray.)




SCENE 8
RAYMON COUNTY; STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL
(Mulder, Scully and Doctor Glass are walking outside the building.)

GLASS: Ray Soames was a patient of mine, yes. I oversaw his treatment for just over a year for clinical schizophrenia. Ray had an inability to grasp reality. He seemed to suffer from some kind of post-traumatic stress.

MULDER: Is that something you've seen before?

GLASS: I've treated similar cases.

SCULLY: Were any of those Ray Soames' classmates?

GLASS: Yes.

MULDER: We're trying to find a connection in these deaths. Did you treat any of these kids with hypnosis?

GLASS: No, I did not.

SCULLY: Are you treating any of these kids now?

GLASS: Currently? Yes, I'm treating Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell. Both have been long term live-in patients.

(They stop walking.)

SCULLY: They're here at this hospital?

GLASS: That's right, going on four years now.

SCULLY: Would it be possible for us to talk to them?

GLASS: Well, you might find it difficult. Certainly, in Billy Miles' case.

(Billy Miles lays on his hospital bed very still. His eyes are open but there is no sign of life except for the pulse read-out on the monitor. The three walk in. Peggy O'Dell sits in her wheelchair next to Billy. A nurse is changing the sheets on the adjacent bed.)

GLASS: Billy's experiencing what we call a waking coma. Functionally, his brainwaves are flat and he's persistent vegetative.

SCULLY: How did it happen?

GLASS: Both he and Peggy were involved in an automobile accident out on State road.

(He looks over to Peggy.)

Peggy?

PEGGY O'DELL: "...aerial..."

(She stops reading.)

Peggy, we have some visitors, would you like to talk with them for a moment?

PEGGY O'DELL: Billy wants me to read now. "It's not sand, it's dark..."

(Mulder kneels down in front of her.)

MULDER: Does he like it when you read to him?

PEGGY O'DELL: Yes. Billy needs me close.

(Mulder walks back over to the doctor.)

MULDER: Doctor. I'm wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam on Peggy.

(She throws the book down, tips over the food tray, and starts wheeling around.)

NURSE: Peggy? Oh, Peggy, what are you doing?

GLASS: Get an orderly.

(Nurses and Doctor Glass go to her. She grabs her nose and starts screaming.)

MULDER: No one is going to hurt you!

(She moves her hand away from her nose and it is covered with blood, as well as her face. She falls forward off the chair and onto the floor.)

GLASS: This is an emergency. Get an orderly, get an orderly. Nobody is going to hurt you. The nurse is here.

(Mulder takes the opportunity to lift up the back of Peggy's shirt. She has the bumps. Mulder looks at Scully, who looks back in shock.)

NURSE: I'm ringing for the orderlies now.

PEGGY O'DELL: Stop it! Stop!

DR. GLASS: All right, Peggy. All right. It's all right.

NURSE: Peggy, honey, you're going to be fine. You've had these nose bleedings before, now calm down. Don't worry...

(Scully walks out angrily. Mulder walks down the stairs quickly after her.)

MULDER: What's his name, er... Billy said he was sorry he didn't get to say goodbye.

SCULLY: How did you know that girl was going to have the marks?

MULDER: I don't know, lucky guess?

SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder, cut the crap. What is going on here? What do you know about those marks? What are they?

MULDER: Why? So you can put it down in your little report? I don't think you're ready for what I think.
(They stop walking.)

SCULLY: I'm here to solve this case, Mulder, I want the truth.

MULDER: The truth? I think those kids have been abducted.

SCULLY: By who?

MULDER: By what.

SCULLY: You don't really believe that?

MULDER: Do you have a better explanation?

SCULLY: I'll buy that girl is suffering some kind of pronounced psychosis. Whether it's organic or the result of those marks, I can't say. But to say that they've been riding around in flying saucers, it's crazy, Mulder, there is nothing to support that.

MULDER: Nothing scientific, you mean.

SCULLY: There has got to be an explaination. You've got four victims. All of them died in or near the woods. They found Karen Swenson's body in the forest in her pajamas, ten miles from her house. How did she get there? What were those kids doing out there in the forest?




SCENE 9
COLLUM NATIONAL FOREST, NORTHWEST OREGON
(Scully and Mulder walk through the forest, carrying flashlights. They both are no longer in suits, now wearing jackets and pants. Mulder signals to Scully and they split up. Mulder looks at his compass, which is spinning wildly. Scully, in the clearing, bends down and picks up some strange dirt on the ground. A large rumbling begins.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(The rumbling grows louder. She stands and takes out her gun. Walking back, she sees a light shining through the trees.)

Mulder, is that you? Mulder?

(A silhouette from out of the light comes towards her. The man lifts up his shotgun and Scully points her weapon at the man.)

Special Agent Dana Scully, FBI, drop your weapon.

(Detective Miles steps into the light.)

MILES: I'm with the County Sheriff's Department. You're trespassing on private property here.

SCULLY: We are conducting an investigation.

(Mulder walks up and points his gun as well.)

MILES: Get in your car and leave, both of you, or I'll have to arrest you. I don't care who you are.

MULDER: Hold on! This is a crime scene.

MILES: Did you hear what I said? You are on private property without legal permission. Now, I'm only going to say it one more time, get in your car and leave.

(Mulder and Scully lower their flashlights and weapons. They walk out past the yellow tape and pass a truck with huge searchlights on them that created the light. They get into their car and drive off.)

MULDER: What's he doing out here all by himself?

SCULLY: Maybe it has something to do with this.

(She holds out a handful of dirt. He turns on the carlight.)

What do you think it is?

MULDER: I don't know. Is it a campfire?

SCULLY: It was all over the ground. I think something is going on out here, some kind of a sacrifice, maybe. What if these kids are involved in some kind of occult and that man knows something about it?

(Mulder takes out his compass and looks at it. It is acting very strangely.)

I wanna come back here.

(Mulder looks at his watch, which reads 9:03. He looks down at the compass again.)

You okay, Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, I'm just, er...

(He starts looking up through the windshield.)

SCULLY: What are you looking for?

(There is a loud roar and a light engulfs them. Time seems to stop just for a second. When the light fades, the car slowly comes to a stop, having no power. Mulder tries to restart the car, but it will not go.)

What happened?

MULDER: We lost power, brakes, steering, everything.

(He looks at his watch.)

We lost nine minutes.

(He gets out of the car and screams into the sky. Scully gets out. They scream over the rain to each other as they talk.)

SCULLY: We lost what?

MULDER: Nine minutes. I looked at my watch just before the flash and it was nine-o-three. It just turned nine-thirteen.

(He starts running down the road.)

Look! Look!

(They stop at the pink "X" that Mulder marked in the road, only a few feet from the car.)

Oh-ho, yes! Abductees... people who have made UFO sightings, they've reported unexplained time loss.

SCULLY: Come on.

MULDER: Gone! Just like that.

SCULLY: No, what a minute. You're saying that, that time disappeared. Time can't just disappear, it's, it's, it's a universal invariant!

(The car starts up and the headlights shine on them. Mulder smiles.)

MULDER: Not in this zipcode.

(He runs back over to the car. Scully looks down at the "X" and follows.)




SCENE 10
SCULLY'S HOTEL ROOM
(Scully is typing on her laptop. We hear her voice over the scene. As she types, it reads:

"Agent Mulder's insistence of time loss due to unknown forces cannot be validated or substantiated by this witness"

She continues typing. A thunderclap rings out and the power goes out.)

SCULLY: Great.

(She goes into her bathroom, carrying a candle and wearing a bathrobe. She starts running a bath and takes off her robe, revealing only a bra and underwear. She goes to slip off her underwear when she feels something. Two bumps on her lower back.)




SCENE 11
MULDER'S HOTEL ROOM
(Mulder, carrying a candle, opens the door to see Scully standing in her bathrobe, shaken.)

MULDER: Hi.

SCULLY: I want you to look at something.

MULDER: Come on in.

(Scully walks in, turns around and slips off her robe. She is still wearing only a bra and underwear. She looks back at him, then down to her lower back. Mulder sees a few bumps.)

SCULLY: What are they?

(Mulder starts to smile.)

Mulder, what are they?

MULDER: Mosquito bites.

SCULLY: Are you sure?

MULDER: Yeah. I got eaten up a lot myself out there.

(She gasps in relief, slips her robe on and hugs Mulder for a long time.)

You okay?

SCULLY: Yes.

(She pulls away from the hug.)

MULDER: You're shaking.

SCULLY: I need to sit down.

(She sits down. He sits down in a seat across from her.)

MULDER: Take your time.

(Later, Scully is laying on the bed and Mulder sits in front of it on the floor.)

I was twelve when it happened. My sister was eight. She just disappeared out of her bed one night. Just gone, vanished. No note, no phone calls, no evidence of anything.

SCULLY: You never found her.

MULDER: Tore the family apart. No one would talk about it. There were no facts to confirm, nothing to offer any hope.

SCULLY: What did you do?

MULDER: Eventually, I went off to school in England, I came back, got recruited by the bureau. Seems I had a natural aptitude for applying behavioural models to criminal cases.

(Outside, a man in a raincoat shuffles through the bushes.)

My success allowed me a certain freedom to pursue my own interests. And that's when I came across the X-Files.

(He turns to face her.)

SCULLY: By accident?

MULDER: At first, it looked like a garbage dump for UFO sightings, alien abduction reports, the kind of stuff that most people laugh at as being ridiculous. But I was fascinated. I read all the cases I could get my hands on, hundreds of them. I read everything I could about paranormal phenomenon, about the occult and...

(He sighs and drifts off into thought.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: There's classified government information I've being trying to access, but someone has been blocking my attempts to get at it.

SCULLY: Who? I don't understand.

(She sits up a little.)

MULDER: Someone at a higher level of power. The only reason I've been allowed to continue with my work is because I've made connections in congress.

SCULLY: And they're afraid of what? That, that you'll leak this information?

MULDER: You're a part of that agenda, you know that.

SCULLY: I'm not a part of any agenda. You've got to trust me. I'm here just like you, to solve this.

(He moves closer, kneeling.)

MULDER: I'm telling you this, Scully, because you need to know, because of what you've seen. In my research, I've worked very closely with a man named Dr. Heitz Werber and he's taken me through deep regression hypnosis. I've been able to go into my own repressed memories to the night my sister disappeared. I can recall a bright light outside and a presence in the room. I was paralyzed, unable to respond to my sister's calls for help.

(He moves even closer, talking louder.)

Listen to me, Scully, this thing exists.

SCULLY: But how do you know...

MULDER: The government knows about it, and I got to know what they're protecting. Nothing else matters to me, and this is as close as I've ever gotten to it.

(The phone rings, startling Scully. Mulder picks up.)

Hello? What? Who is this? Who is thi...

(He hangs up.)

That was some woman... she just said Peggy O'Dell was dead.

SCULLY: The girl in the wheelchair?




SCENE 12
RURAL HIGHWAY 133
BELLEFLEUR, OREGON
(A mack truck sits in the road, ambulances and police cars surrounding it. People stand outside talking.)

MAN #1: Yeah, I'll bring it over in a minute.

(A sheriff lights a flare and puts it down in the road to ward off traffic. Mulder and Scully pull up.)

MAN #2: We're going to need a couple of more hours, Bob.

(Mulder walks over to a deputy and the driver.)

MULDER: What happened?

TRUCK DRIVER: She ran right out in front of me.

DEPUTY: Who are you?

MULDER: She was running? On foot?

(The county coroner pulls up and Scully uncovers Peggy's face. Her neck is in a brace, and she is very bloody. There are tubes in her nose. Scully looks at Peggy's watch, which has stopped and reads 9:03. Scully walks over to Mulder and the deputy. Mulder is very ornery.)

Well, that's just...

SCULLY: We need to ask you a few quest...

MULDER: Let's go, let's go.

(She looks at him and he leads her to the car.)

Someone trashed the autopsy bay in the lab and they stole the body, we're going back to the motel.

SCULLY: What? They stole the corpse?




SCENE 13
HOTEL
(Scully and Mulder pull up and run out of the car. Police and firemen are all around. Mulder runs over to a deputy and shows him his badge.)

MULDER: F.B.I.

(They stop and look at the hotel, which is ablaze.)

SCULLY: There goes my computer.

MULDER: Damn it! The x-rays and pictures!

(Firemen run around, one climbing a ladder.)

FIREMAN: We need a couple of men out here!

(Mulder closes his eyes, frustrated and angry. Theresa Nemman steps out of the crowd and over to the agents.)

THERESA NEMMAN: My name is Theresa Nemman. You've got to protect me.

MULDER: Come with us.




SCENE 14
DINER
(Scully sits next to Theresa in a booth. Mulder sits across from them.)

THERESA NEMMAN: This is the way it happens, I don't know how I get out there. I'll just find myself out in the woods.

MULDER: How long has it been happening?

THERESA NEMMAN: Ever since the summer we graduated. It's happened to my friends too. That's why I need you to protect me. I'm scared I might... die like the others, like... Peggy did tonight.

MULDER: Your father's the medical examiner. You were the one on the phone, you told me Peggy O'Dell had been killed.

(Theresa nods.)

SCULLY: Theresa, your father knows about this, doesn't he? About what happened.

THERESA NEMMAN: Yes. But he said never to tell anyone about any of it.

MULDER: Why?

THERESA NEMMAN: He wants to protect me. He thinks he can protect me, but I don't think he can.

MULDER: Do you have the marks, Theresa?

THERESA NEMMAN: Yes. I'm going to die, aren't I? I'm gonna be next?

SCULLY: No, you're not going to die.

(Blood pours out of Theresa's left nostril.)

Oh, God!

(Scully runs over to the adjacent table and gets some napkins. Before she can give them to Theresa, she notices Nemman and Miles walk in.)

JAY NEMMAN: Let's go home, Theresa. Theresa, come on.

(He pushes Mulder out of the way and sits down next to Theresa. He puts a handkercheif to her nose.)

Come on, honey.

MULDER: I don't think she wants to leave.

JAY NEMMAN: Come on...

(Nemman looks at Mulder.)

I don't care what you think! She's a sick girl.

MILES: Your father wants to take you home. He'll get you all cleaned up.

JAY NEMMAN: I'm going to take you where you'll be safe, Theresa. Detective Miles and I won't let anything happen to you, I promise.

(Mulder looks at Miles in shock.)

MULDER: You're Billy Miles' father?

DETECTIVE MILES: That's right. And you stay away from that boy.

(Outside, Theresa looks at Mulder and Scully from the back seat of Nemman's van. The windows roll up and they drive away. Mulder and Scully watch them go.)

MULDER: Eh, you gotta love this place. Everyday's like Halloween.

SCULLY: They know Mulder. They know who's responsible for the murders.

MULDER: They know something.

(They start walking to the car.)

SCULLY: Dr. Nemman's been hiding medical evidence from the beginning. He lied on the autopsy reports and now we find out about the detective. Who else would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms?

(They stop.)

MULDER: Why would they destroy evidence? What would they want with that corpse?

SCULLY: I don't know, I...

MULDER: Makes you wonder what's in those other two graves.




SCENE 15
CEMETARY; 5:07
(As the rain pours down, Mulder and Scully, carrying flashlights, walk into the cemetary to find that the other two graves have been unearthed and are empty.)

MULDER: They're both empty.

SCULLY: What is going on here?

MULDER: I think I know who did it. I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.

SCULLY: Who? The detective?

MULDER: The detective's son. Billy Miles.

SCULLY: The boy in the hospital? The vegetable?! Billy Miles, a boy who's been in a coma for the last four years, got out here and dug up these graves?

MULDER: Peggy O'Dell was bound to a wheelchair but she ran in front of that truck. Look, I'm not making this up, it all fits the profile of alien abduction.

SCULLY: This fits a profile?

MULDER: Yes. Peggy O'Dell was killed at around nine-o-clock, that's right around the time we lost nine minutes on the highway, I think that something happened in that nine minutes. I think that time, as we know it, stopped. And something took control over it.

(She smiles, almost laughing.)

You think I'm crazy.

(She nods and he walks away a little. Her face becomes grimmer. He looks back at her and notices that something is bothering her.)

What?

SCULLY: Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped a couple of minutes after nine. I made a note of it when I saw the body.

MULDER: That's the reason the kids come to the forest, because the forest controls them and summons them there. And, and, and the marks are from, from some kind of test that's being done on them. And, and that may be causing some kind of genetic mutation which would explain the body that we dug up.

SCULLY: And the force summoned Theresa Nemman's body into the woods tonight.

MULDER: Yes, but it was Billy Miles who took her there, summoned by some alien impulse. That's it!

(Scully laughs, finding everything ludicrous but believing it. Mulder smiles.)

Come on, let's get out of here.

SCULLY: Where are we going?

MULDER: We're going to pay a visit to Billy Miles.

(They start walking back.)




SCENE 16
RAYMON COUNTY; STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL
(Mulder talks to the nurse while Scully looks at Billy's fingers.)

NURSE: Now, we could stand here until the second coming, waiting for Billy to get out of this bed. It ain't going to happen. He blinks and I know about it.

(She starts changing his IV.)

MULDER: I guess you changed his bedpan last night.

NURSE: Hmm, nobody else here's gonna do it.

MULDER: You noticed nothing unusual? Do you remember what you were doing last night around nine-o-clock?

NURSE: Mmm, probably watching TV, yeah.

MULDER: Do you rememeber what you were watching?

NURSE: Um, let's see... you know I don't really remember what I watched.

(Scully goes over to Billy's feet and lifts the covers up.)

Miss?

(Scully starts inspecting Miles' feet.)

What is she looking for?

SCULLY: Mulder, take a look at this.

(Mulder looks at it and Scully opens up an evidence vial. She starts scraping off some of the strange dirt into the vial. Mulder looks back at the nurse.)

MULDER: Do you know who was taking care of Peggy O'Dell last night?

NURSE: Not me, it's not my ward. Not my aisle of the produce section.

(She laughs. Mulder humors her by laughing slightly.)

I do have a job of my own to do... what is she doing now?

(Scully closes up the vial.)

MULDER: Thank you for your time, ma'am.

NURSE: Okay.

MULDER: Good day.

(Mulder leads Scully out. Once outside the room, Scully walks rapidly, excited.)

SCULLY: That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell, I don't believe this.

MULDER: Scully...

SCULLY: It's crazy! He was in the woods.

MULDER: You're sure?

(She holds up the vial in a baggie.)

SCULLY: This is the same stuff that I took a handful of in the forest.

MULDER: Okay, then maybe we should take it and run a lab test...

SCULLY: We lost the original sample in the fire. What else could it be?

(They stop.)

MULDER: All right, but I just want you to understand what it is you're saying.

SCULLY: You said it yourself.

MULDER: Yeah, but you have to write it down in your report.

(Scully calms down.)

SCULLY: You're right. We'll take another sample from the forest... and run a comparison before we do anything.




SCENE 17
COLLUM NATIONAL FOREST, NORTHWEST OREGON
(They pull up to the forest and see Miles' van. Mulder shines his flashlight in the front seat. It is empty.)

SCULLY: The detective's here. What do you think?

(A woman's scream rings out. Mulder and Scully start running through the forest. They split up, running through foliage, searching for the girl. Out of nowhere, Miles hits Scully on the head with the butt of his gun. She falls and looks up at Miles.)

MILES: You wouldn't listen to me. I told you to stay out of this.

(He runs off as she struggles to get up. Mulder stops and hears another scream, then starts running to his left. He nearly trips over a root and sees Miles standing in front of him, cocking his shotgun.)

Hold it, hold it right there! You got no business out here.

MULDER: There were screams...

MILES: Down on the ground. Now!

MULDER: You know it's Billy. You've known it all along.

MILES: I said down on the ground.

(Mulder kneels.)

MULDER: How long are you gonna let it happen?

(The woman screams again.)

He's gonna kill her!

(Miles looks towards the screams, then runs off. He sees Billy lifting up Theresa's shoulders. The wind is growing and the leaves are swirling around them.)

MILES: Billy, no! Let her go! Leave her alone!

(Billy looks at him, then goes back to lifting her up. Miles points his shotgun and Mulder tackles him. A shot rings out. Scully, holding her head, hears the shot and runs in the direction of it. Mulder and Miles watch on the ground as Billy takes Theresa in his arms and looks up. Mulder notices the two welts on Billy's back. The wind grows stronger and a light encompasses them. Mulder and Miles stand, looking at the light. Scully looks from a distance as the light grows. The light and wind die down and there is a thunderclap. Billy stands there, Theresa on the ground. She looks at him and he looks at his father.)

BILLY MILES: Dad?

MILES: Billy. Oh, god.

(They hug. Mulder sees that the bumps are gone. Mulder realizes that his partner is missing.)

MULDER: Scully.

(He picks up his flashlight and starts running. They meet halfway.)

Scully!

SCULLY: Mulder, what happened? There was a light.

MULDER: It was incredible.

(They both gasp for air, Mulder smiling slightly.)




SCENE 18
MARCH 22, 1992
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Doctor Heitz Werber sits across from Billy.)

HEITZ WERBER: If you can hear me, raise your right hand.

(Billy does so slowly.)

Tell me about the light, Billy. When did you first see the light?

BILLY MILES: In the forest. We were all in the forest having a party. All my friends. We were celebrating.

HEITZ WERBER: What were you celebrating?

BILLY MILES: Graduation. And then the light came. It took me away to the testing place.

(Mulder is off to the side, watching. His reflection can be seen in the mirror.)

They would tell me to gather the others so that they could do tests. They put something in my head... here.

(He puts his hand on his head where his nasal cavity is. On the other side of the mirror, Scott Blevins, the Cigarette-Smoking Man, the third man from before, and Scully are watching.)

I would wait for their orders.

HEITZ WERBER: Billy, who gave the orders?

BILLY MILES: The light. They said it would be okay. No one would know. But the test didn't work. They wanted everything destroyed. They said they were leaving. I'm afraid. I'm afraid they're coming back.

(Billy starts crying. The Cigarette-Smoking Man whispers in Blevins' ear.)

HEITZ WERBER: Don't be afraid Billy, we're gonna help.

SCOTT BLEVINS: All right, let's go.

(As they all start to file out, Mulder looks at the mirror directly at Scully. Scully looks at him, knowing that he cannot see her, then leaves.)




SCENE 19
SECTION CHIEF BLEVINS' OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Blevins is seated at his desk and the third man is seated next to the right of him. Scully is sitting across from Blevins.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: What we've just witnessed, what we've read in your field reports... the scientific basis and credibility just seem wholly unsupportable, you're aware of that?

SCULLY: Yes, sir. My reports are personal and subjective. I don't think I've gone so far as to draw any conclusion about what I've seen.

THIRD MAN: Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case. This, uh... time loss... you did or did not experience it?

SCULLY: I can't substantiate it, no.

SCOTT BLEVINS: What exactly can you substantiate, Agent Scully? I see no evidence that justifies the legitimacy of these investigations.

SCULLY: There were, of course, crimes committed.

SCOTT BLEVINS: Yes, but how do you prosecute a case like this? With testimony given under hypnosis from a boy who claims that he was given orders from some alien force through an implant in his nose? You have no physical evidence.

(Scully stands and puts down the vial with the nasal cavity implant on Blevins' desk.)

SCULLY: This is the object described by Billy Miles as a communication device. I removed it from the exumed body.

(Blevins looks at it.)

I kept it in my pocket, it was the only piece of evidence not destroyed in the fire. I ran a lab test on it, the material could not be identified.

SCOTT BLEVINS: Agent Mulder, what are his thoughts?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.

SCOTT BLEVINS: Thank you, Agent Scully, that will be all.

(Scully leaves the office as she walks down the hallway, she passes the Cigarette-Smoking Man. She watches him go into Blevins' office, then starts walking.)




SCENE 20
SCULLY'S APARTMENT
(Scully lays in bed, eyes wide open, unable to sleep. The time is 11:21. It changes to 11:22. The phone rings and Scully picks up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

MULDER: Scully? It's me, I haven't been able to sleep. I talked to the D.A.'s office in Raymon County, Oregon. There's no case file on Billy Miles. The paperwork we filed is gone. We need to talk, Scully.

SCULLY: Y, yes. Tomorrow.

(She hangs up slowly, then grows a little tenser as she lays down.)




SCENE 21
HIDDEN ROOM
(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks down a long hallway. On either side of him are rows upon rows of shelves containing brown boxes. He comes up to one and pulls out a casing holding many of the same kind of vials that were in the abductees. He takes out the one from Ray Soames' body and puts it in the casing with the rest of them. Putting the casing back, he walks down the rest of the hallway, comes to the door and walks out. Closing the door, he then runs his keycard through it's sensor. The sign on the door reads:

"In Case Of Fire Or Emergency
Know Your Exits
PENTAGON
Evacuation Procedure"

There is a map of the Pentagon next to it. The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks away.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
NEAR ELLENS AIR BASE
SOUTHWEST IDAHO
(Several military police surround what looks to be a normal house)

COMMANDING OFFICER: As soon as we're in position, we'll be on a count of five.

(A woman comes up to a police barrier)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Excuse me, that's my house.

MILITARY POLICE OFFICER: Ok, let her through.

(The woman runs up to the commanding officer)

ANITA BUDAHAS: What's going on?

COMMANDING OFFICER: Standby. Mrs. Budahas?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Yeah.

COMMANDING OFFICER: Your husband has violated basic security procedure. He's commandeered a military vehicle that's believed to be armed.

LEAD OFFICER: Keep on moving in.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Oh God!

(The MP's cover the entrance of the house, while two others get ready to use a battering ram to break open the front door. The Lead Officer signals the officers to begin with a countdown from five, on his fingers. The door is broke open and the MP's move in, securing each room)

VOICE: We have access..

ANITA BUDAHAS: You've got to let me talk to him.

(The MP's secure the upstairs, room by room. Finally kicking in a door finding their target)

LEAD OFFICER: What the hell. We got him but he's gonna need a doctor.. or something.

(We see a man, wearing only his underwear, sitting trembling in a corner of the room. His skin looks like it has been burned and blistered)




SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.
(The camera pans down a aerial shot of a road. Next we see the inside of a bar, a waiter is making and serving drinks. We see Scully, sitting at the bar, she checks her watch before continuing to work at a file. Mulder appears)

SCULLY: Hi. I got your message.

MULDER: Sorry for the run around. Can I buy you a drink?

SCULLY: It's two-o-clock in the afternoon Agent Mulder.

MULDER: It's not stopping the rest of these people. I got something to show you.

SCULLY: Something you couldn't show me at work.

MULDER: Let's get a table. (Mulder and Scully make their way through the crowded bar. We see many people sitting at the bar, but one particular man seems to be watching Mulder and Scully. Scully is looking through a file, we see a photo of a man, the same man we saw trembling in his home at the start, in a military uniform) That's Colonel Robert Budahas. That photo was taken last year when he was a test pilot for the military, stationed at Ellens Air Base in Southwest Idaho. Four months ago, Colonel Budahas experienced a psychotic episode and barricaded himself in his home. Military police were called in. Budahas was removed and apparently hospitalised with treatment of his condition.

SCULLY: Which was what, exactly?

MULDER: The military will not comment on the cause, nature or status. In fact, the military will not comment on Colonel Budahas at all.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months. Her inquiries to the military have gone unanswered. Last month, she contacted the FBI and reported it as a kidnapping.

SCULLY: What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own pilots?

MULDER: That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question, Scully. (Mulder passes Scully some new information, a thick pile of papers) Since 1963, six pilots have been listed as missing in action, from Ellens Air Base. The military will say only that these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft.

SCULLY: Yeah, there were rumours those pilots were shot down at high altitudes, while they were routinely penetrating Russian air space.

MULDER: There were other rumours too. I've been tracking this case since it came through the Boise regional office last month. Last week, for reasons I can't figure out, it was deprioritised. They shelved this case without an investigation, Scully.

SCULLY: So?

MULDER: So, you and I, are going to the spud state to investigate a little kidnapping.

SCULLY: I don't get it Mulder. Does this have something to do with an X-File? I thought you only liked those, er, paranormal type cases. Am I missing something here?

MULDER: Let's just say, this case has a, distinct smell to it, a certain, paranormal bouquet. Excuse me.

(Mulder gets up and goes to the restroom)




SCENE 3
(Mulder walks from a urinal to the sink and washes his hands. Another man leaves the restroom. Mulder bends down and rinses his face then gets up and dries it. He sees, in the mirror, a man standing behind him, the same man that was watching him from the bar. Mulder turns to face him)
DEEP THROAT: Leave this case alone Agent Mulder.

MULDER: What?

DEEP THROAT: The military will not tolerate an FBI investigation.

MULDER: Who are you?

DEEP THROAT: I, er, can be of help to you. I've had a certain interest in your work.

(There is a knock on the door, we see that it has been bolted from the inside)

VOICE: Sorry.

MULDER: How do you know about my work?

DEEP THROAT: Well, let's just say that I'm in a position to know quite alot of things, er, things about our government.

MULDER: Who are you? Who do you work for?

DEEP THROAT: It's unimportant, I came here to give you some valuable advice. You are exposing yourself and Agent Scully to unnecessary risk, I advise you to drop the case.

MULDER: I can't do that.

DEEP THROAT: You have much work to do Agent Mulder, (The man unlocks the door) don't jeopardise the future of your own efforts.

(The man leaves and as Mulder rushes out after him, he is obstructed by another man trying to come into the restroom. Mulder pushes passed the man, and moves out into the bar. When he looks around he sees no sign of the man, he was talking to. Scully notices Mulder's curious
look and approaches)




SCENE 4
SCULLY: You ok Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, I'm fine.




SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(Scully is sitting at a large microfiche film reader screen, reading through information on Ellens Air Base and it's association with UFO buffs. One phrase that Scully seems to focus on reads, `...technology with stealth weaponry...')

(We see Mulder standing in his kitchen, his phone rings)

MULDER: Hello.

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: I checked on that file you gave me.

MULDER: Uh-huh.

SCULLY: You failed to tell me a few things. (Mulder hears clicking noises coming from his phone, he takes the phone away from his ear) This isn't some UFO goose chase, you're leading me on, is it? (Mulder listens into the phone again) Are you there Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

(Mulder walks towards his window and looks through some of the blinds, he sees a van parked across the road, outside his apartment)

SCULLY: Did you hear what I said, because the bureau has it out for us already and it would make us appear pretty stupid if my field report, read like some tabloid story.

MULDER: Er, listen, I don't want to talk about it on this line. I'll, I'll talk to you about it, on the flight out, OK?

(Mulder hangs up)




SCENE 6
MARRIETTE FIELD
SOUTHWEST IDAHO
(Mulder knocks on the door of the house belonging to the woman we saw at the start. An aircraft flies passed and Mulder and Scully both turn around to try and see it. The door opens)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Hello?

(Mulder and Scully turn back around to face the Mrs. Budahas)

MULDER: Mrs. Budahas?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Yes.

(Mulder takes out his id and shows it to Mrs. Budahas)

MULDER: We're from the FBI.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Oh, yes, please, come in. (Mulder and Scully, enter the house, we see a picture of Lt. Col. Budahas hanging on the wall) I started noticing it about two years ago, m, Bob developed this rash under his arms. We'd been doing some renovations on the house, so that, we thought it was a reaction to the paint stripper. But then everything just, went crazy.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

(Mulder is looking at the photos of Lt. Col. Budahas)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Bob's whole personality, it was so unpredictable. He started, doing things.

MULDER: What kinds of things?

ANITA BUDAHAS: It was kind of embarassing at first, we were having this dinner party once, and, erm, he sprinkled tetra-meal D all other his food. (Scully, looks confused as she doesn't know what tetra-meal D is) That's fishfood flakes.

SCULLY: Did you ever talk to him about this?

ANITA BUDAHAS: I tried, i, it was extemely difficult, Bob would get so angry, he'd, yell at the kids for no reason, and, and then, and then he would shake, like he was having a, a seizure.

MULDER: Did he ever talk about his work?

ANITA BUDAHAS: It was never discussed, e, even before the problems. Oh, I knew that he worked on top secret projects, word gets around, but, Bob was always a patriot first. He took, loyalty to his country as an oath, and, and now they treat us like strangers. I just want my husband back.

SCULLY: You know that the government is not above the law. They cannot withhold information.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Th, then I think, what if he's... (Mrs. Budahas starts to cry a little) How would I support the family?

MULDER: Eeh, you said word gets around, I'm sorry, erm, have you ever heard of this, happening to anyone else?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Erm, yeah. Verla McLennen's husband, he went kinda crazy, but it's, it's not like he didn't get to come home.




SCENE 7
VERLA McLENNEN'S HOUSE
(We see the apparatus for preparing hooks for flyfishing being used. We then see a man, pull a small hair from his closely shaven head, he checks the hair and uses it on his hook)

SCULLY: How long has he been...

VERLA MCLENNEN: Almost two years, the flyfishing idea was his brother Hank's. I was upset at first, but when you're the wife of a test pilot, you thank God just to have him home alive.

MULDER: Mrs. McLennen, has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this?

VERLA MCLENNEN: Stress, I guess. You have to understand, the military deals with things in a certain way. They've given him plenty of therapy, and treatment, and I'm grateful for that. They've taken good care of us. And you know they do volunteer for their jobs. (Mrs. McLennen stands beside Mrs. Budahas) Really Anita, bringing the FBI to my house.

(We see the man, Mr. McLennen, he is still making his hooks)

(Back outside Mrs. Budahas' house. Mrs. Budahas gives a piece of paper to Scully)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Here, I've, erm, I've called all the numbers about a thousand times, please, let me know what you find out.

SCULLY: We'll be staying at the Beech Grove Motel if you anything, ok?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Thanks. (Mrs. Budahas walks towards her house, while Mulder and Scully walk away) C'mon kids.

MULDER: So what did you make of Uncle Fester down the block?

SCULLY: Mmm, it's called sterioptathy, it's a syndrome produced by extreme stress. POWs have been known to suffer from it, they've studied it in zoo animals.

MULDER: Yeah, but these guys aren't zoo animals, they're test pilots. They're not supposed to fold under pressure, they're supposed to thrive on it.

(Mulder and Scully are standing beside their car)

SCULLY: Ever hear of something called The Aurora Project?

(Mulder takes off his jacket and puts it in the car)

MULDER: Yeah, that's the, er, unacknowledged codename for some new kind of defence department, surveillance project.

SCULLY: The Pentagon has all but admitted, they've been testing a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft over the western US. Maybe, these guys are flying those planes. Maybe, these guys are the washouts.

MULDER: You saw the photos on the wall in there. This guy Budahas received a presidential commodation, he's never washed out of anything in his life.

(Mulder gets in the car, after a brief hesitation, Scully moves to the other side of the car)




SCENE 8
BEECH GROVE MOTEL
SCULLY'S ROOM
(We see Scully hang up the telephone, Mulder comes in holding up his cellular phone and sits on the bed)

MULDER: I've been on hold with the base director of communications for fourty-five minutes, how about you?

SCULLY: Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us, a week from Friday.

MULDER: Yeah, right. (Mulder lifts up a telephone directory) Did you say Kissel?




SCENE 9
(We see a car drive down a road and into a driveway. Mulder and Scully are sitting in their car opposite the house in which the car just pulled into. They get out of the car and walk towards the man who just got out of the car)
MULDER: Colonel Kissel?

COLONEL KISSEL: Yes.

MULDER: Can I talk with you? Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

COLONEL KISSEL: I've got nothing to say. Please, this is an invasion of my privacy.

MULDER: Why don't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas?

COLONEL KISSEL: Why don't you get the hell out of my yard.

(Colonel Kissel enters his house and shuts the door)

SCULLY: Good thing we still kept that appointment.

(Mulder and Scully turn around when they hear a man greeting them and walking up the driveway towards them)

PAUL MOSSINGER: Hi. Are you the FBI agents? I'm Paul Mossinger, I, er, work for the local paper. We live a few houses down from Verla McLennen, she said you guys are out here looking into this Budahas thing.

MULDER: We're just looking around.

(Mulder and Scully, walk out of the drive, away from the man)

PAUL MOSSINGER: Aah, gotcha, right. Lot of people around here just looking around, UFO nuts mostly, but it's not everyday we get FBI. (Another aircraft flies overhead and they all stop to look) By the time you hear them, they're already gone. So this Budahas thing, are you getting anywhere?

MULDER: We're not at liberty to comment.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Well...

MULDER: Paul? Right? You've lived in this area a while, you ever seen a UFO?

PAUL MOSSINGER: Never, bunch of hoo-ey if you ask me. People see what they wanna see.

MULDER: But, if I wanted to talk to those UFO nuts, that you refered to earlier, where would I go?




SCENE 10
FLYING SAUCER DINER
(Another aircraft flies overhead, the glasses on the shelves of the diner all shake)

ZOE: F-15 Eagle pulling about four g's. Those boys think they are such hotshots. Get a few
drinks in `em, you'd think it was them up there flapping their wings.

(Mulder laughs)

MULDER: Who's the photographer?

(Mulder is refering to several photos atached to the shelves, photos of UFOs)

ZOE: Various and sundry. I took the one on the end there.

(The photo is of a large triangular shaped craft in the air)

MULDER: You're kidding, where?

ZOE: Out on the back porch, taking out the garbage, and there it was, just hovering. (Zoe takes
the photo down and shows it to Mulder) Quiet like a hummingbird. For a minute there, I
thought it was gonna land in the parking lot and I was gonna have to serve `em lunch.
(Scully takes the photo from Mulder and looks at it) I'm selling limited edition prints, twenty
dollars. Down to my last five, if you're interested.

MULDER: Put it on my tab.

(Scully leans over to Mulder)

SCULLY: Sucker.

MULDER: What would the chances be, of someone like me, seeing a UFO?

SCULLY: Catch ye outside.

(Outside the diner, Scully is looking at a map, Mulder comes out)

SCULLY: Wanna see something weird, Mulder? Ellens Air Base isn't even on my US GS quadrant map.

MULDER: I know. Let's go.

SCULLY: You know. Where are we going?

MULDER: We got our own map, sucker.

(Mulder gives Scully a piece of paper with a roughly drawn map on it)




SCENE 11
OUTSIDE ELLENS AIR BASE
6:04 p.m.
(Mulder and Scully, drive off the main road and up a hill. At The bottom of the hill is a sign saying:

WARNING: THIS AREA IS A RESTRICTED MILITARY INSTALLATION TO THE WEST.

At the top of the sign is a symbol indicating no cameras. Mulder stops the car further up the road beside a fence. He gets out goes to the boot and gets a pair of binoculars)

SCULLY: What do you honestly hope to see?

MULDER: I don't know, maybe nothing.

SCULLY: Is this why we came out here, Mulder? To look for UFOs. (Mulder is walking up a grassy embankment) Yea, this is gonna look real good on my field report.

(It is night time and Scully is sleeping in the car. Suddenly the car starts shaking, Scully begins to rouse and is shocked awake by the sound of the rear window shattering)

SCULLY: Aaaaaah!

(Mulder comes running down the embankment)

MULDER: Scully, wake up. You've gotta see this.

(Mulder opens the car door and pulls Scully up the embankment)

SCULLY: Unnh!





9:13 p.m.
(Mulder and Scully see two small lights flying through the sky in the distance)

SCULLY: What are they?

MULDER: I don't know, just keep watching it's unbelievable.

SCULLY: That's unreal. I've never seen anything like it.

MULDER: They've been going at it like that for almost half an hour.

SCULLY: Well, it can't be aircraft. Aircraft can't manoeuvre like that.

MULDER: What else could they be?

SCULLY: I don't know, lasers maybe. Being shot from the ground, reflecting up off the clouds. (The two lights fly up through the clouds and disappear. Scully turns to face Mulder, her expression is one of amazement) Oh my God.

(Another bright light appears in the distance)

MULDER: Here comes another one.

SCULLY: That's not a plane, that's a helicopter.

(Mulder and Scully hear noises from the botton of the embankment, we see a guy and a girl coming through the fence and past a bush)

MULDER: Hey.

EMIL: Let's get outta here. (The young couple run off, Mulder and Scully chase after them across
a field. Mulder draws his gun, the guy notices it and both he and the girl stop and raise
their hands) Ok, don't shoot.

MULDER: Stay right there.

LADONNA: We didn't do anything.

(They all look up at the helicopter as it's search light gets closer to them)

MULDER: Come on.

(They all hide under the cover of a tree)

EMIL: Heh, heh, That was extreme.

MULDER: Let's go, you're coming with us.

EMIL: What?




SCENE 12
5:02 a.m.
(Inside another diner, the two kids are sitting eating away, while Mulder and Scully are sitting on the other side of the table)

SCULLY: So, what exactly were you guys doing in there?

EMIL: We were, erm, we're...

(Emil and the Ladonna laugh)

LADONNA: We kinda have this spot.

EMIL: You know, we go, we kinda, kick back and listen to some tunes and, er, watch the air show.

MULDER: Were you ever chased out before?

EMIL: No, first time right. Our friend showed us a hole in the fence about a year ago.

LADONNA: Oh, one time they dropped these bombs, wooah!

EMIL: Yeah, it was kinda heavy. (he laughs) Oh, ar, there's this place, ar, called the Yellow Base,
right, where they're supposed to store all this stuff. And my friend said that, there's
landmines all around it and junk like that.

(Outside the diner, a car pulls up and stops when the driver, Paul Mossinger, has Mulder and Scully in sight. He talks into a walkie-talkie)

PAUL MOSSINGER: I've got a twenty, over.

WALKIE-TALKIE: Roger, Redbird, assume fall back position, we're opening the gate.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Redbird out.

(Back inside the diner, Emil is demostrating, with a hamburger, how the lights sometimes fly)

EMIL: Sometimes they come in real low, and just put on the scares right, it's like eeoou-ra and
then they just hang there, and hover without making a sound. And you just think, you
know, who turned down the volume right.

MULDER: What do you think they are?

EMIL: Ok, everybody thinks that they're like UFOs, but I think it's some kinda, star wars cyber-
tech new fangled hardware right, they probably roll it out for, desert storm II or something
like that. Cruise right over Saddam's house, you know, it'll be like, what.

(He laughs. Then Mulder pulls out the photo, of the UFO, he bought at the Flying Saucer diner)

MULDER: Do they look anything like this?

EMIL: No, (Mulder's expression saddens a little) they look exactly like that.

(Mulder lifts Emil's mo-ped out of the trunk of his car and puts in on the ground)

EMIL: Thanks.

MULDER: Later Dude!

(Emil laughs and he and Ladonna walk up a driveway pushing the mo-ped. Mulder gets back into the car and takes a tape out of his shirt pocket)




SCENE 13
SCULLY: What's that?

MULDER: Evidence. (Mulder puts the tape in the stereo and the sound of heavy metal guitar music fills the car. Scully turns it off) Kids today, huh.

SCULLY: You believe it all, don't you?

MULDER: Why wouldn't I?

(Scully has a great big smile across her face, almost laughing)

SCULLY: Mulder, did you see their eyes? If I were that stoned I...

MULDER: Ho-hoo. If you were that stoned, what.

SCULLY: Mulder, you could have shown that kid a picture of a flying hamburger and he would have told you that's exactly what he saw.

MULDER: Alright, I wanna show you something. (Mulder reaches into the back seat of the car and lifts a folder, he opens it and takes out a photo, which he gives to Scully) This is a photo, of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now I know, you don't believe that story but just hear me out. Now, Ellens Air Base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base, that for some strange reason, doesn't appear on your US government map, is supposedly, one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.

SCULLY: Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs.

MULDER: No, planes built, using UFO technology.

(Scully smiles again at Mulder's total belief in UFOs, which she does not believe at all. Mulder gives Scully the photo from the diner)

SCULLY: Mulder, c'mon. You've got two blurry photos, one of them taken almost fifty years ago, and another one, you purchased today in a roadside diner. You're going out on a pretty big limb.

MULDER: Tell me, there isn't a remarkable resemblance.

SCULLY: Tell me, one good reason why either of these photos is authentic.

MULDER: You saw exactly what I saw in the sky tonight. What do you think they were?

SCULLY: Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean I'm gonna believe they were UFOs.

MULDER: Unidentified Flying Objects, I think that fits the description pretty well. Tell me I'm crazy.

SCULLY: Mulder, you're crazy. (Mulder chuckles) And it still doesn't explain to me, what happened to Colonel Budahas.




SCENE 14
BEECH GROVE MOTEL
(We see the reception office of the Beech Grove Motel, Scully is standing in it)

SCULLY: Thanks.

WOMAN: You're welcome.

(Scully comes running from the reception to Mulder's room. Mulder sees her running towards his room and gets up opens the door)

MULDER: You didn't come to raid my mini-bar, did ye?

SCULLY: You ready for this.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: We got a message from Mrs. Budahas, her husband came home last night.




SCENE 15
(Mulder and Scully drive to Mrs. Budahas' home. Mrs. Budahas opens the door)
SCULLY: We got your message.

(Mrs. Budahas is crying)

MULDER: Mrs. Budahas, are you ok?

ANITA BUDAHAS: C,come inside.

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: What? What's wrong?

(We see a man, who looks like Lt. Col. Robert Budahas, painting a model of an airplane)

ANITA BUDAHAS: That, is not my husband.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Honey, who are these people?

(Mulder looks at the photo of Lt. Col. Budahas, on the wall)

ANITA BUDAHAS: That is not him. That is not my husband. They've done something to him.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: What are you talking about?

MULDER: It's ok, it's ok, just relax, wel, I'm Special Agent Mulder, from the FBI. We're out here investigating your disappearance Colonel Budahas. Wondering if you have any explanation of your whereabouts over the past four months.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: I was in the hospital.

MULDER: Here, on base?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: I think so.

MULDER: Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birthdate?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: November 21st, 1948.

(Mulder looks at Mrs. Budahas for confirmation, she nods her head)

MULDER: And the names of your kids?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Josh and Lesley, they're right there.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Yeah.

(Mulder notices the shirt Col. Budahas is wearing says Green Bay)

MULDER: Green Bay fan.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Yes sir.

MULDER: Bet you remember the Superbowl of 68, huh? Don Shandler.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Kicked four field goals, Lombardy's last game. Why do I have to answer these questions?

ANITA BUDAHAS: It's not him.

MULDER: Colonel, Colonel Budahas, you're a, a pilot, isn't that right?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Yes sir.

MULDER: Bet you've flown just about everything with two wings. I got this hotshot pilot friend, who said that he could do Immelmann at a sustained eight g's, huh, is that possible?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: I, I don't... I can't... Anita, I can't remember.

(Col. Budahas gets up to go to Mrs. Budahas, but she backs off, scared and crying)

ANITA BUDAHAS: No.

(Mulder and Scully leave the house)




SCENE 16
SCULLY: Mulder, would you explain to me what's going on.

MULDER: I think they re-wired that man's brain. Some kind of selective memory drain.

SCULLY: The brain doesn't work like that, Mulder. You can't just go in and erase certain files.

MULDER: Then you explain it to me.

SCULLY: There are types of amnesia th..

MULDER: This is not amnesia, I think it's something far more deliberate and insidious.

SCULLY: All I'm saying, is that the science or medical technology to do what you are suggesting, does not exist.

MULDER: And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we saw last night. Listen to me Scully, they can do this. That man, he should have known the answer to the question, it just wasn't in his head anymore.

(Mulder and Scully are driving along a road)

SCULLY: Even if they could, why would they do such a thing?

MULDER: To control information. I think that after his psychotic episode, Colonel Budahas became a security risk.

SCULLY: It couldn't just be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse?

MULDER: No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas are physiologically incapable of dealing with the stress of flying the aircraft we saw. Or doing those manoeuvres, at those speeds. I mean we're talking about a technology that is so sensitive and advanced, that it's taken almost fifty years to make it work. UFO technology, Scully.

(Scully smiles again, but this time she also gives a little laugh. Ahead two cars are approaching fast, the two cars cover both sides of the road, one slightly infront of the other)

SCULLY: What the hell is th..

MULDER: Hold on.

(Mulder slams on the brakes. The other two cars turn and stop sideways, blocking the road infront and behind Mulder and Scully. Groups of men wearing suits get out of both cars. One man approaches Mulder's side of the car and knocks on the window)

MAN: Please, step out of the car.

MULDER: You think if maybe we ignore him, he'll go away?

(The man knocks on the window again)

MAN: Please, step out of the car.

MULDER: Guess not. (Mulder gets out of the car) Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

(As he reaches for his id, another man pushes him up against the car and searches him. Scully gets out of the car)

SCULLY: Federal Agents.

(Scully is also searched, as is the car. The glove compartment is checked and Mulder's file containing the photos from Roswell. The magazine in Mulder's gun is removed and the gun is put on top of the car. The same is done with Scully's gun. One of the men opens the trunk and gets Mulder's camera, he opens it and pulls out the film, exposing it all to the light. Scully's briefcase is emptied of it's contents)

MULDER: You wanna tell me what this is about.

(A man punches Mulder in the ribs)

MAN: National security. Now get in your car. You'll be escorted back to your motel. You will pack
and leave town immediately, or assume the consequences of intense indiscretion.




SCENE 17
(Back at their motel, Scully is walking round her room, talking on the phone)
SCULLY: Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356, no plate registered under that number. Thanks Gayle, no no no, I'm sure the other one's bogus too, bye. (Mulder is lying on the bed) So who were those guys?

MULDER: I don't think it was those kids they were chasing away from the base last night, I think it was us. They knew we were coming before we ever arrived. And they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy. There's something I didn't tell you, Scully.

SCULLY: Something else.

MULDER: I was approached by a man in D.C. who warned me to stay away from this case, he didn't give me his name, and my phone was being tapped.

SCULLY: What!

MULDER: Why would they go to all this trouble? Out of a need for security. Security of what? I think there's a huge conspiracy here Scully. They've got a UFO here, I'm sure of it. And they'll do anything to keep it a secret, including sacrificing lives and minds of those pilots, because what if that secret got out.

SCULLY: If, if that were true, it would be a national scandal.

MULDER: No no, you're not thinking big enough, if it were true, it would be confirmation of the existence of extra terrestrial life.

SCULLY: Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply an experimental plane. Like the stealth bomber or, this Aurora Project. Doesn't the government have a right and a responsibility, to protect it's secrets?

MULDER: Yes, but at what cost, when does the human cost become too high for the building of a better machine?

SCULLY: Look, these are questions we have no business asking. Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding. Let's get out of here Mulder, while you still have a job.

(Mulder picks up the photo from the diner and holds it in front of Scully)

MULDER: Aren't you even curious? (Scully takes the photo from Mulder and sits down) Aaerm, I gonna shower, I'll pack and then, we'll get outta here.

(Mulder leaves the room, Scully is pleased that Mulder is agreeing with her to leave. Scully gets up and walks towards the bathroom, from outside she hears the sound of their car starting. She runs outside)

SCULLY: Mulder, where are you going?

(Mulder drives off)




SCENE 18
(Emil and Ladonna show Mulder the hole in the fence at the air base)

EMIL: Right here.

(Mulder climbs through the hole)

MULDER: Hey, aren't you guys coming?

EMIL: No, we're, you know, we've only gone in at night.

MULDER: Ok, this spot you told me about where you watch the air show, how far is it?

EMIL: Fourty-five minutes.

MULDER: Will I be able to find it?

LADONNA: Just stay on the path.

MULDER: And what about this other place you told me about, Yellow Base, where they hangar them.

EMIL: Don't, don't even, it's like ten miles, nobody's ever, nobody's ever been that far.

LADONNA: Hey, don't go past the edge of the tall weeds.

EMIL: Oh man, did we tell him about the, landmines and junk? HEY!

(Mulder walks to the edge of the tall weeds, he checks his watch and sits and waits until nightfall. He then leaves the tall weeds and walks towards Yellow Base. As he stands on the concrete ground, he notices a single light coming towards him. It is a triangular shaped aircraft, with lights at every point, which hovers above him. Several lights, on the underside of the aricraft, flicker on Mulder and he has to hold his hand in front of his eyes as the light becomes a beam surrounding him. After a few seconds, the light around Mulder disappears and the aircraft flies off at a great speed)




SCENE 19
(Behind Mulder, two vehicles approach, Mulder turns and sees them coming and starts running along the road. One vehicle stops in front of Mulder and the other behind him, several military officers jump out of the vehicles and tackle Mulder to the ground. Mulder is then lifted onto a stretcher and strapped down and put inside one of the vehicles)

VOICE: Go, go.

(Inside the van, Mulder is held down and he sees someone holding up a syringe and testing the contains are getting through the needle on the end)

MULDER: Nooo.

(Mulder is injected with the substance of the syringe)

VOICE: C'mon. Hold `im. Oxygen.

(An oxygen mask is put over Mulder's face)




SCENE 20
6:30 a.m.
(Scully is talking on the phone in her room at the Beech Grove motel)

SCULLY: Yeah, I'm, I'm trying to make a call to Washington D.C. an, and I can't seem to get a long distance line. (Her phone suddenly goes dead) Hello? Hello? (Scully puts the phone down beside her holstered gun and goes over to the motel reception office) Excuse me. Erm, my phone's not working, can I use yours to make a credit card call, please?

MOTEL MANAGER: Sure thing.

SCULLY: This one's not working either.

MOTEL MANAGER: Phones are pretty undependable around here. People say it's the military interference, but, they say that about everything.

SCULLY: Thanks.




SCENE 21
(We see two hangar doors open and the van Mulder is in reverses in. The van comes to a stop and Mulder is taken out, still strapped to the stretcher. Mulder is barely conscious and sees the lights above him. As he looks around him , he sees men in white coats everywhere on one side of him and, some sort of aircraft behind a plastic curtain, on the other side)



SCENE 22
(Scully is walking back to her room when she notices Paul Mossinger coming out of her room, she reaches behind her for her gun, but it's still in her room)
PAUL MOSSINGER: Hi, I was just looking for you. I knocked, but I saw the door was open.

SCULLY: I was in the lobby trying to make a call.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Phones down again.

SCULLY: Yeah.

WALKIE-TALKIE: Base to redbird, can you give us your position, over? (Scully looks over at Paul's car as she hears the walkie-talkie, she looks back at Paul and smiles before running and getting into his car and locking the doors) Redbird do you copy?

PAUL MOSSINGER: What are you doing? (Scully reaches for the ignition but finds no key, she looks under the sun visors but finds nothing. Paul taps the window with the car key) Excuse me. (Scully reaches for the glove compartment) There's nothing in there.

(As she opens it, she finds a gun and Paul's ID: Airbase Security. Paul smashes the passenger's window with a fire extinguisher and Scully drops the gun while covering herself from the glass. Paul reaches in for Scully but she manages to push her thumb in his eye. He then goes around to the driver's door but Scully gets out and holds the gun to his face)

SCULLY: Get on the car. Hands on the car, do it.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Put the gun down, and we'll talk about it.

(Emil and Ladonna come riding up on the mo-ped. Scully pushes Paul to the car and holds the gun at his back)

SCULLY: I said, hands against the car. Who are you?

PAUL MOSSINGER: You're a long way from home, Dr. Scully. Nobody wants this to come to violence now.

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

EMIL: We took `im to the base.

LADONNA: We waited for `im.

SCULLY: I want you to get on that walkie-talkie and find out where Mulder is.

PAUL MOSSINGER: I don't think I can do that.

SCULLY: I think you can, or I'm gonna have every newspaper in America out here, writing about your experimental aircraft.

(A light is turned on, which shines brightly. We see a doctor come into view below the light, he looks into Mulder's eye. Mulder in strapped down to a medical table now, and Mulder looks around, but without moving his head. Another oxygen mask is put over Mulder's face and the doctor puts drops into Mulder's eyes)

(Paul Mossinger is driving his car, Scully is in the back holding the gun at him)

PAUL MOSSINGER: There are other ways to go about this.

SCULLY: Yeah, I've already seen where you get with tears and a sad story.

(The car approaches the gates to Yellow Base and stops, Paul turns off the engine. One of the guards on the gate is listening to a walkie- talkie)

WALKIE-TALKIE: Your target is arriving 12.

GUARD: Roger.

SCULLY: What are we doing?

PAUL MOSSINGER: Waiting.

SCULLY: I want the car running. I said start the car. (Paul starts the car) And put your hands on the wheel, where I can see them.

PAUL MOSSINGER: You do anything stupid, and this situation could get big in a hurry.

SCULLY: Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.

WALKIE-TALKIE: Intruder arriving.

GUARD: Copy.

(A jeep is approaching the gate from the inside of the base, the guards open the gate. The jeep comes to a stop as it reaches the gate. Mulder steps out and walks towards the other car)

SCULLY: I want you to keep the car running, and step out of the car. (Both Paul and Scully get out of the car, Scully keeps the gun pointed at Paul as she moves around the car and behind him) Get in the car Mulder. Get in the car.

(Mulder walks, very slowly towards the car, Paul walks towards the jeep. As they pass, Paul stops and turns to Mulder)

PAUL MOSSINGER: I just wanna say, everything you've seen here is equal to the protection we give it. It's you who have acted inappropriately.

(Both men continue to walk towards the vehicle in front of them. Scully gets in the car, followed by Mulder. As soon as Mulder is in, Scully drives off, quickly)

(Scully is driving the car back to town)

SCULLY: You ok Mulder?

MULDER: I think so. Scully I...

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: How did I get here?




SCENE 23
(Mrs. Budahas opens the door to her house, but only enough so that she can stand in facing Mulder and Scully)
MULDER: Hi.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Hello.

MULDER: We came by to see how your husband was doing.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Oooh, he's fine, he's getting much better now.

MULDER: Do you think, maybe, we could see him.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Aaerm, wel, well he's resting now.

LT COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Who is it now?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Thank you for your concern.

(She closes the door)

MULDER: They got to her Scully. They were here, they must have threatened her and Budahas..

SCULLY: That's enough Mulder. We don't know anything. Anything more than when we got here, and that's what I gonna write in my field report. Let's get outta here Mulder, as fast as we can.




SCENE 24
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
ONE WEEK LATER
(Scully is typing up her field report, we hear the words as Scully types them)

Lt Colonel Robert Budahas, was returned to his home, although his own knowledge of his disappearance and whereabouts is vague and inconclusive. Special Agent Mulder's insistence that Budahas may have been a test pilot, on a top secret project involving aircraft using recovered UFO technology, and may have suffered severe stress related trauma by flying these aircraft, is also inconclusive. Though, this Agent can collaborate Agent Mulder's eye-witness account of two
unidentified flying objects, in the northern sky over Ellens Air Base, their exact nature or design could not be determined. Barring further authorised inquiry, this case - filed `DF101364' - is closed .

(Scully lifts up the photo of the UFO that Mulder bought at the diner and sits looking at it)




SCENE 25
(Mulder is running around a sports track, he stops and takes a rest before noticing Deep Throat approaching. Mulder walks towards him, meeting him halfway across the field)
DEEP THROAT: Your lives, may be in danger.

MULDER: Why?

DEEP THROAT: Mmm, you've seen things that weren't to be seen. Care and discretion, are now imperative.

MULDER: I saw something I...

DEEP THROAT: As I said, I can provide you with information, but only so long as it's in my best interest to do so.

MULDER: What is your interest?

DEEP THROAT: The truth.

MULDER: I did see something, but it's gone, they took it from me, they erased it. You have to tell me what it was.

DEEP THROAT: A military UFO? Mr. Mulder, why are those like yourself, who believe in the existence of extra terrestrial life on this earth, not dissuaded by all the evidence to the contrary?

MULDER: Because, all the evidence to the contrary, is not entirely dissuasive.

DEEP THROAT: Precisely.

(Deep Throat walks away)

MULDER: They're here, aren't they?

(Deep Throat stops and turns to face Mulder)

DEEP THROAT: Mr. Mulder, they've been here for a long long time.

(Deep Throat continues to walk away, leaving Mulder standing by himself)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
BALTIMORE, MD
(The camera pans over the city to an overhead view of a man leaving a restaurant. The man, dressed in a suit, walks along the street. The view changes to show a drain on the sidewalk. The scene with the man suddenly fades to black and white with only the man staying in color. The camera moves closer to th drain and a shape can be seen within it. The man stands opening the trunk of a car, as the shape in the drain gets closer, we see it is a pair of eyes)

(Next we see the man stepping out of an elevator, from a security monitor, the camera pans right to show the man walking away from the elevators and passed some offices. The elevator doors open but the elevator is not there. The cables in the shaft are shaking. A desklight is turned on inside an office and the man sits down, picks up the phone and dials a number)

MRS. USHER: Hi, you're reached the Usher residence, please leave a message at the tone, thank you.

(The man picks up, and shakes an ornamental snowstorm)

MR USHER: Hi honey, it's about 8:30 and erm, I'm gonna be here for a while. The presentation didn't go so well, call me, I love you, bye.

(The man, Mr. Usher, then lifts up a mug from his desk and leaves his office. Meanwhile, we see a narrow ventilation shaft, one of the screws, on the cover, seems to unscrewing itself, and then the cover opens. The man pours himself a cup of coffee, a hand emerges from the shaft. The man walks back to his office, as he enters, the door suddenly slams shut. There are screams and the door handle moves up and down as the man tries desperately to get out of the office. Part of the door suddenly breaks outwards in the struggle and then the struggle is over)

(Inside the office, blood is dripping onto the carpet, the desk is scattered with papers also covered in blood. In a reflection, from an object on the desk, we see the man lying dead, blood covering his face. The cover of the shaft is pulled closed and the screw, rescrews itself in place)




SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.
TOM COLTON: Guess who I ran into from our class at Quantico? Marty Neill.

(Tom Colton is sitting having lunch with Dana Scully, in a restaurant)

SCULLY: J. Edgar Jr?

TOM COLTON: Just got bumped up, Foreign Counter Intelligence, New York City Bureau, Supervisory, Special Agent.

SCULLY: Supervisory?

TOM COLTON: That's right.

SCULLY: Two years out of the academy, how'd he land that?

TOM COLTON: Lucked into the World Trade Center bombing.

SCULLY: Well, good for Marty.

TOM COLTON: Oh, come on Dana, the guy is a loser, look where he is now. That's where we should be.

SCULLY: Brad Wilson told me, the pyshological profile you wrote on the Washington Crossing Killer led them straight to the suspect. Word has it, you're on the Violent Crime Section's fast track.

TOM COLTON: So how are you doing? Have you had any close encounters of the third kind?

SCULLY: Is that what everyone thinks I do?

TOM COLTON: No, of course not. But you do work with Spooky Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder's ideas maybe a bit out there but he is a great agent.

TOM COLTON: Yeah, well, I've got this case that's, out there. Baltimore PD cops, they want our help on a serial killer profile. Three murders began six weeks ago, victims vary in age, race, gender, no known connections to each other.

SCULLY: I take it there's a pattern?

TOM COLTON: Point of entry. Actually, the lack of one.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

TOM COLTON: One victim, college girl, killed in her ten by twelve center block dorm room. She was found with the windows locked and the door chained from the inside. The last incident, two days ago, high security office building, nothing on the security monitors, janitor spoke to the victim minutes before the murder, didn't hear or see a thing out of the ordinary.

SCULLY: Suicides?

(Tom picks up a photo from beside him and gives it to Scully)

TOM COLTON: Each victim was found with their liver, ripped out. No cutting tools used.

SCULLY: Bare hands. This looks like an X-file.

TOM COLTON: Let's not get carried away. I'm gonna solve these murders but, what I would like from you is, to go over the case histories. Maybe, come down to the crime scene.

SCULLY: Do you want me to ask Mulder?

TOM COLTON: Ok, if he wants to come and do you a favor, great. But make sure he knows this is my case. Dana, if I can break a case like this one, I'll be getting my bump up the ladder. And you, maybe you won't have to be Mrs. Spooky anymore.




SCENE 3
CRIME SCENE
GEORGE USHER'S OFFICE
BALTIMORE, MD
(Mulder and Scully are standing in Usher's office)

MULDER: So why didn't they ask me?

SCULLY: They're friends of mine from the academy, I'm sure they just felt more comfortable talking to me.

MULDER: Why would I make them so uncomfortable?

SCULLY: It probably has to do with your reputation.

MULDER: Reputation? I have a reputation?

SCULLY: Mulder, look. Colton plays by the book and you don't. They feel your methods, your theories are...

MULDER: Spooky? Do you think I'm spooky?

VOICE: Agent Scully's in here sir.

(Tom enters)

TOM COLTON: Dana, sorry I'm late.

SCULLY: We just got here. Er, Fox Mulder, Tom Colton.

TOM COLTON: So, Mulder, what do you think, does this look like the work of little green men?

MULDER: Grey.

TOM COLTON: Excuse me.

MULDER: Grey. You said green men, a Reticulan skin tone is actually grey, they're notorious for their extraction of terrestrial human livers. Due to iron depletion in the Reticulan galaxy.

TOM COLTON: You can't be serious.

MULDER: Do you have any idea what liver and onions go for on Reticula? `scuse me.

(Mulder walks off to look around the office, Tom can be heard talking to Scully in the background, Mulder looks down as he sees something)

TOM COLTON: Dana, I've been thinking about this and I have a theory, might explain alot, tell me what you think.

(Mulder bends down to pick up, using tweezers, what looks like a piece of metal thread)

What if the guy enters...

(Mulder looks at the thread and then looks up and sees the cover to the ventialtion shaft)

Hold on a second. What in the hell's he doing?

(Mulder lifts up a small brush and dusts around the cover)

Err, that vent is six inches by about eighteen, even if a Reticulan could crawl through, it's screwed in place.

(Mulder has revealed an elongated fingerprint)




SCENE 4
X-FILES OFFICE
(Mulder has several slides on a lightbox showing fingerprints)

MULDER: This is the print I took yesterday from Usher's office, these others are from an X-file. Ten murders, Baltimore area, undetermined points of entry, each victim had their liver removed. These prints were discovered at five of the ten crime scenes.

SCULLY: Ten murders, Colton never mentioned..

MULDER: Most likely, he's not aware of them. These two prints were lifted five years before he was born at Powhatan Mill. And these three were lifted probably, five years before his mother was even born.

SCULLY: Are you saying, these prints are from the 1960's and the 1930's?

MULDER: And fingerprinting was just coming into it's own in 1903, but there was a murder involving an extracted liver.

SCULLY: Of course.

(Scully wheels her chair away from the table and stands up)

MULDER: Now that's five murders every thirty years. That makes two more to go this year.

SCULLY: You're saying these are copy-cats.

MULDER: What did we learn in our first day at the academy, Scully? Each fingerprint is unique, these are a perfect match.

SCULLY: Are you suggesting that I go before the Violent Crime Section and present a profile declaring that these murders were done by aliens?

MULDER: No, of course not, I find no evidence of alien involvement.

SCULLY: Well, what then? That, that this is the work of a hundred year old serial killer who is capable of overpowering a healthy six foot two businessman.

MULDER: And he should stick out in a crowd with ten inch fingers.

SCULLY: Look, bottom line, this is Colton's case.

(Mulder get up and stands beside Scully)

MULDER: Our X-file dates back to 1903, we had it first.

SCULLY: Mulder, they don't want you involved. They don't want to hear your theories. That's why Blevins has you hidden away down here.

MULDER: You're down here too. Look, why don't we agree to this, they'll have their investigation, we'll have ours and never the twain shall meet. Agreed?




SCENE 5
SCULLY'S APARTMENT
(Scully is typing up her report from a tape recording of her views)

After a careful review of the violent and powerful nature of these murders, I believe the killer to be a male, twenty-five to thirty-five years of age, with above average intelligence.

(We see the blueprints of a building, probably of the floor where George Usher worked)

His matter of entry has so far been undetectable, this may be due to his superior knowledge of the inner-structure of buildings and duct works. Or that he in fact hides in plain sight, posing as delivery or maintenace workers.

(Scully lifts up a slide of an elongated fingerprint and looks at it)

The extraction of the liver is the most significant detail of these crimes. The liver possesses regenerative qualities, it cleanses the blood,

(Scully's report continues but now she is telling it to Tom Colton and his superiors in a meeting)

the taking of this trophy is the transferring act for the killer to, cleanse himself of his own impurities. I think he is acting under, the classic form of obsessive compulsive behaviour. Now since the victims are unrelated, and we cannot predict who will be next, we must utilise the fact that a killer will not always succeed in finding a victim. When this occurs, a serial killer may, return in frustration to the sight of a previous murder, hoping to, recapture the emotional high. I think our best course of action is to target these sights.

FULLER: Good job, Agent Scully. If there are no objections, I'd like to begin our stakeouts of the murder sites tonight. We're looking for a male, twenty-five to thirty-five, possibly wearing a uniform, gas company, UPS, whatever. I know you're assigned to another area Scully, but if you don't mind some overtime, you're welcome to come aboard with us, on this. Erm, that is if you don't mind working in an area that's a bit more down-to-earth.




SCENE 6
CRIME SCENE
7:15 P.M.
(Scully is sitting in a car on a floor of the building's car park)

WALKIE-TALKIE: Position ten, do you check?

SCULLY: Position ten, I copy.

(Scully hears noises and gets out of the car and removes her gun. She walks forward to a wall and we hear the sound of someone running. As a man jumps through a large circular hole in the wall, Scully points her gun at him. It's Mulder, who stops and raises his hands)

MULDER: You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would ya copper?

(Scully walks back to her car)

SCULLY: Mulder, what the hell are you doing here?

MULDER: He's not coming back here, his thrill is derived from the challenge of unseemingly impossible entry. He's already beaten this place, if you'd read the X-file on the case, you'd come to the same conclusion.

SCULLY: Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout.

MULDER: Seeds?

(Mulder holds up a bag he is carrying)

You're wasting your time, I'm going home.

(Mulder leaves and Scully gets back into the car. As Mulder is walking away he hears some noises, he stands behind a pillar but sees no one. He walks towards a caged off area of the car park and sees movement inside a ventilation duct. Mulder runs back to Scully)

Scully, call for backup and get over here.

SCULLY: Position ten requesting backup.

(Scully gets out of the car and runs over to Mulder, who is standing at a wall looking at the area with the ventilation ducts)

MULDER: In there.

(Mulder and Scully run over to the cage, and seeing the movement for herself, Scully points her gun at the duct)

SCULLY: Federal Agent, I'm armed. Proceed down the vent, slowly.

(A foot kicks open the duct hatch and a man exits, he slowly stands up and turns around holding his hands up. Several agents come running to the scene)

TOM COLTON: Take `im.

AGENT: Alright, move, move, move.

AGENT 2: FBI.

AGENT: Don't move, don't move, get your hands up, keep `em up.

AGENT 2: You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent..

MULDER: You were right.

(In the background we can hear an agent reading the man his rights)




SCENE 7
FBI BUREAU
BALTIMORE, MD
(The man arrested is taking a polygraph test, the examiner is marking the parts of the printout that are the man's answers)

EXAMINER: Is your full name, Eugene Victor Tooms?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Are you a resident of the state of Maryland?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Are you an employee of the Baltimore Municipal Animal Control?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Is it your intent to lie to me about anything here, today?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Were you ever enrolled in college?

(We see that the test is being watched from another room through a two way mirror)

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Were you ever enrolled in medical school?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

(Watching the test is, Agents Mulder, Scully, Colton, Fuller and a guard)

EXAMINER: Have you ever removed a liver from a human being?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Have you ever killed a living creature?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Have you ever killed a human being?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Were you ever in George Usher's office?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Did you kill George Usher?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Are you over one hundred years old?

TOM COLTON: That must be a control question.

MULDER: I had her ask it.

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Have you ever been to Powhatan Mill?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: In 1933?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Are you afraid you might fail this test?

EUGENE TOOMS: Well, yes, because I didn't do anything.

(The test is over and now the examiner and the agents are discussing the results in the test room)

EXAMINER: He nailed it, A plus, as far as I'm concerned, the subject did not kill those two people.

(Mulder gets up and checks the results himself. Fuller comes in.)

FULLER: Maintenance people at the office building, confirm the call to animal control regarding a bad smell. They found a dead cat, in the ventilation ducts on the second floor.

TOM COLTON: Well, that's that.

SCULLY: It still doesn't explain what he was doing there that late at night.

FULLER: So, he's one of the few civil servants we have with initiative, and we busted him for it.

SCULLY: He was crawling up an air duct, by himself, without alerting security.

TOM COLTON: Dana, he passed the test, his story checks out, he's not the guy. It doesn't mean that your profile's incorrect.

MULDER: Scully's right, it is the guy.

FULLER: Whatta you got, Mulder?

MULDER: He lied on questions eleven and thirteen, his electrodermal and cardiographic response nearly go off the chart.

FULLER: Is number eleven, the hundred year old question? Well, let me tell ye, I had a reaction to that stupid question. And what the hell is this Powhatan Mill thing.

MULDER: Two murders with matching mo's occurred in Powhatan Mill in 1933, just look at the chart.

EXAMINER: My interpretation of those reactions..

FULLER: I don't need you or that machine, telling me if Tooms was alive in `33.

MULDER: He's the guy.

FULLER: I'm letting him go.

(Fuller and the examiner leave the room, Tom turns to Scully)

TOM COLTON: You comin'?

SCULLY: Tom, I wanna thank you for letting me put in some time with the VCS, but I am officially assigned to the X-files.

TOM COLTON: I'll see what I can do about that.

SCULLY: Tom, I can look out for myself.

TOM COLTON: You said Mulder was out there, that guy's insane.

(Tom leaves and Scully turns to look at Mulder)

(Mulder and Scully are walking through an office floor of the bureau)

SCULLY: You knew they wouldn't believe you, why did you push it?

MULDER: Maybe I thought you caught the right guy. And maybe I run into so many people, who are hostile, just because they can't open their minds to the possibilties, that sometimes the need to mess with their heads, outweighs the millstone of humiliation.

(They stop at the bottom of some stairs)

SCULLY: It seems like you were acting very territorial, I don't know, forget it.

(Scully goes to turn away but Mulder stops her, he is touching Scully's necklace)

MULDER: Of course I was, in our investigations, you may not always agree with me but at least you respect the journey. And if you wanna continue working with them, I won't hold it against ye.

(Mulder starts up the stairs and after a brief pause, Scully follows)

SCULLY: Er, I don't know, you must have something more than your polygraph interpretation to backup this bizarre theory and I have to see what it is.




SCENE 8
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT
(Mulder is looking at the arrest record of Eugene Tooms on computer)

MULDER: These are Eugene Tooms' prints.

(Mulder isolates the left middle finger print and discards the rest, for a fingerprint anaylsis)

This is the fingerprint they took from Usher's office,

(Mulder brings up one of the elongated fingerprints)

it matches the old ones from the X-files. Obviously no match, but what if, somehow...

(Mulder squashes Tooms' print sideways, then stretches it lenghtways. Next he overlaps the two prints on screen, a readout shows a match of one hundred percent)

SCULLY: How could that be?

MULDER: Only thing I know for certain is, they let him go.




SCENE 9
(It is a dark night and a car pulls into a driveway, as it gets closer to the house, a motion sensor light comes on. We see a pair of eyes watching from the bushes. As the man gets out of the car and walks around it, all color, again, fades to black and white except for the man)
(Eugene Tooms jogs from the bushes to the side of the house and looks in a window. The man enters the room, and Tooms backs off as the man gets closer to the window. Tooms then runs to another part of the house and looks up, he starts climbing the wall. Inside the house, the man checks through some envelopes and takes off his jacket. Tooms has made it up the wall and pulls himself onto the roof beside the chimney stack, which he enters by stretching his body to fit)

(The man walking from the kitchen, with a drink in his hand, enters the living room and stands by the mantel drinking his drink. The man puts his drink on the mantel and straightens a small glass container. He bends down and opens the doors to the fire, he then strikes a long match and tries to light some paper in the fire. From the shadows of the room, emerges Tooms. As the man turns around, Tooms jumps on him and pushes him onto the floor. The man is kicking, trying to get up, but looses the struggle)

(It is daytime and a man is stretching a measuring tape across the murdered man's living room)

FULLER: Sixty-four inches from the south wall.

TOM COLTON: Let's run a check on liver transplants in the next twenty-four hours, maybe this thing is black market.

FULLER: C'mon, it was ripped outta there.

TOM COLTON: Look at this point, I'm willing to give any theory a shot.

(He sees Mulder and Scully enter the house)

Any sane theory, I'm sorry Dana but I only want qualified members of the investigating team at the crime scene.

MULDER: What's the matter Colton, you worried I'm gonna solve your case?

(Mulder goes to walk further into the house but Colton stops him)

SCULLY: Tom. We have authorized access to this crime scene. A report of you obstructing another officer's investigation might stick out on your personnel file.

(Tom lets Mulder enter)

TOM COLTON: Look Dana, whose side are you on?

SCULLY: The victim's.

FULLER: A hundred and five inches from the fireplace.

(Mulder looks at a single elongated fingerprint that has been dusted on the front of the mantel)

SCULLY: The victim is a Thomas Werner, single, white..

MULDER: It's Tooms.

(Mulder points to the fingerprint, and also notices four small prints, like the tips of fingers on top of the mantel)

And he took something.




SCENE 10
(Mulder is looking through a microfiche reader of a county census from 1903, and finds the name, Eugene Victor Tooms. Scully enter the room)

SCULLY: Baltimore PD checked out Tooms' apartment, it was a cover. No one has ever lived there and he hasn't shown up for work since he was arrested.

MULDER: I found him. How do we learn about the present, we look to the past. I think this is where it all began in 1903 on Exeter Street.

(Mulder points to the address of Tooms on screen)

Now look at the address of that first murder in 1903.

(Scully lifts up the file on this case)

SCULLY: Apartment 2 0 3. He killed the guy above him.

MULDER: Maybe, his neighbour played the victrola too loud.

SCULLY: Well, this must be Tooms' great grandfather.

MULDER: What about the prints?

SCULLY: Genetics might explain the patterns, it also might explain the sociopathic attitudes and behaviours. It begins with one family member, who raises an offspring, who raises the next child.

MULDER: So what is this, the Anti-Waltons.

SCULLY: Well, what do you think?

MULDER: I think what we have to do is track Eugene Tooms, there's four down and one to go this year. If we don't get him right now, the next chance is in year.....

SCULLY: 2023.

MULDER: And you're gonna be head of the bureau by then. So I think you have to go through the census, I'm gonna plough through this century's marriage, birth, death certificates, and... You have any dramamine on you by any chance cos, these things make me seasick.

(Mulder and Scully go through the information for hours)

Anything?

SCULLY: Nope, he disappeared off the face of the earth. You?

MULDER: Never was born, never married, never died.

SCULLY: At least in Baltimore County. No, I did find one thing though, erm, it's the current address of the investigating officer at the Powhatan Mill murders in 1933.




SCENE 11
LYNNE ACRES RETIREMENT HOME
BALTIMORE, MD
(Sitting in front of Mulder and Scully is an old man in a wheelchair)

FRANK BRIGGS: I've waited twenty-five years for you.

SCULLY: Sir?

FRANK BRIGGS: I called it quits, in 1968 after, fourty-five years as a cop. And those killings at Powhatan Mill. I was a sheriif then and, er, I'd seen my share of murders, bloody ones. But I could go home and, pitch a few baseballs to my kid and never give it a second thought, you gotta be able to do that. You'd go crazy, right. But those murders in Powhatan Mill, when I walked into that room, my heart, went cold, my hands, numbed. I could feel, IT.

MULDER: Feel what, Frank?

FRANK BRIGGS: When I first heard about the death camps in 1945, I remembered Powhatan Mill. When I see the kurds and the bosnians, that room is there, I tell ye. It's like all the horrible acts that humans are capable of, somehow, gave birth to some kind of, human monster. That's why I say I've been waiting for you. Aah, there's a box in the trunk here, get it for me, would you please.

(Mulder lifts a box out of the trunk and puts it on the bed, Frank wheels himself to it)

Now this, is all the evidence I've collected, officially and unofficially.

SCULLY: Unofficially?

FRANK BRIGGS: I knew the murders in `63 were by the same, person as in `33. But by then, they had me on a desk, pushing papers and they wouldn't let me anywhere near the case.

(Scully lifts a jar out of the box and looks in it)

SCULLY: A piece of the removed liver?

FRANK BRIGGS: Yes, but you know, that's not the only trophy he took with him. Family members reported small personal affects missing in each case. A hairbrush in the Walters murder, a coffee mug in the Taylor murder.

MULDER: Have you ever heard the name, Eugene Victor Tooms?

FRANK BRIGGS: Humh, when they wouldn't bring me aboard in `63 I, I did some of my own work. I took, these surveillance pictures, this, is Tooms.

(Frank shows some photos to Mulder and Scully)

Course, that was him thirty years ago.

(Frank takes out another photo and shows it to Mulder)

And this, is the apartment where he lived. It was located at..

MULDER: 66 Exeter Street?

FRANK BRIGGS: Right. That's it, right there.

(We see the photo of where Tooms lived. The photo changes to reality as Mulder and Scully go there)




SCENE 12
(Mulder and Scully pull up to 66 Exeter Street in their car, they enter the building, it is a run down empty building)

SCULLY: Here's 103.

(They enter the room)

MULDER: The old man was right, you can feel it.

SCULLY: There's nothing here.

MULDER: Check this out.

(Mulder pushes down a mattress that is standing against the wall.
Behind it is a large hole in the wall)

What's down here?

SCULLY: I don't know.

(Scully puts her gun away and enters the hole)

Let's find out.

(Scully climbs down a ladder, followed by Mulder and they shine their torches into the darkness)

Just an old coal cellar.

(As they look further in the cellar, they come across a table full of objects)

MULDER: Somebody having a garage sale.

(Mulder picks up a small glass container)

This is the shape of Werner's mantel.

SCULLY: Frank said he collected trophies.

MULDER: Does he live in here?

SCULLY: It looks like the wall's deteriorating.

MULDER: No, somebody made it.

(Mulder and Scully make their way to part of the room where a wall looks like it's crumbling)

This is a nest, look, it's made out of rags and newspapers.

SCULLY: This looks like the opening, think there's anything inside?

(Mulder feels the opening and gets a slimy substance on his hand)

Oh my God, Mulder, it's smells like, I think it's bile.

MULDER: Is there any way I can get it off my fingers quickly without betraying my cool exterior?

(Mulder quickly flicks the stuff of his fingers)

SCULLY: No one could live in this.

MULDER: I don't think it's where he lives, I think it's where he hibernates.

SCULLY: Hibernates?

MULDER: Just listen, what if some genetic mutation could allow a man to awaken every thirty years.

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: And what if the five livers could provide him sustenance for that period. What if Tooms is some kind of, twentieth century, genetic mutant.

SCULLY: In any case, he's not here now and he's gotta come back.

MULDER: Well we're gonna need a surveillance team.

SCULLY: Yeah, that'll take some fannagling.

MULDER: Well you go down town and see what you can fannagle, I'll keep watch.

(Mulder and Scully get up and walk back towards the opening of the cellar. Scully stops suddenly)

SCULLY: Oh, wait, I'm snagged on something, oh, it's ok, I got it.

(As Scully continues forward, a hand appears from within the rafters and opening it's hand we see Scully's necklace dangling from it. We then see Tooms in the rafters)




SCENE 13
66 EXETER ST., 11:30 A.M.
(Mulder is sitting in his car when one of the back doors open and another agent gets in.
Another one gets in the front)

MULDER: It's about time.

KENNEDY: So, who're we looking for again?

MULDER: Eugene Tooms, he's unarmed but consider him dangerous. Scully and I'll be back to relieve you in eight hours if he doesn't show, right here.

KRAMER: You got it, Spooky.

(Mulder gets out of the car as the two agents are laughing)




SCENE 14
(Scully is siiting in a room at the bureau. Tom comes in)

TOM COLTON: We have to talk.

SCULLY: I have to meet Mulder..

TOM COLTON: That's what we have to talk about. You're using two of my men to sit in front of a building that's been condemned for ten years?

SCULLY: It isn't in any way interferring with your investigation.

TOM COLTON: When we first had lunch, I really looked forward to working with you, you were a good agent, but now after Mulder, I couldn't have you far enough away. Don't bother going down there, I had the stakeout called off.

SCULLY: You can't do that.

TOM COLTON: No, I can't but my regional asat can, especially after I told them about the irresponsible waste in man hours.

(Scully picks up the phone but before she can phone Mulder, Tom takes the phone off her)

Auh-uh! Let me call Mulder, let me tell him the news.

SCULLY: Is this what it takes to climb the ladder Colton?

TOM COLTON: All the way to the top.

SCULLY: Then I can't wait `til you fall off and land on your ass.

(Tom phones Mulder)

[ MULDER'S ANSWER MACHINE ]

This is Fox Mulder, I'm not here, leave a message.

(Scully pulls up outside her apartment. From the darkness we can see the eyes of Tooms, watching. Scully walks from her car to her apartment block and Tooms sees it all in black and white)




SCENE 15
66 EXETER ST., 7:25 P.M.
(Mulder pulls up in his car)

MULDER: Where is everyone? Scully?

(Mulder has a quick look around and then runs and enters the building)

(Back at Scully's apartment)

[ MULDER'S ANSWER MACHINE ]

This is Fox Mulder, I'm not here, leave a message.

SCULLY: Mulder, you must've gone out since Colton gave us the night off, I say we file a complaint against him, I am furious. Call me when you get in, ok, bye.

(Scully is in her bathroom, after hanging up, she runs a bath. Scully walks out of the bathroom and outside the window we see Tooms reach up and feel the window)

(Meanwhile, Mulder is in the cellar below Tooms' apartment. As he looks at the table with the trophies, from the murders, he sees and recognises Scully's necklace)

MULDER: Dammit.

(Scully is back in her bathroom, she lifts a towel of the rack and goes over to the bath and turns off the taps. She lifts a small bottle from a shelf, she moves to the side of the bath to open it. As she opens it, a lump of bile falls from the ceiling and splashes on her hand. She breaths deeply, in shock, and then looks up at the vent in the ceiling, there is bile around one corner of it. Scully rushes out of the bathroom and looks for her gun in the apartment)

(Mulder is driving his car and using his phone)

MULDER: Dammit, ANSWER.

(We see that the phone line to Scully's apartment have been cut)

(Scully is moving about her apartment, with her gun, searching for Tooms. She enters a room and turns, pointing her gun at a small vent near the floor. As Scully turns away from the vent, a hand comes crashing through and grabs Scully's leg causing her to fall. We see the face of Tooms in the vent as well. Scully manages to grab hold of a door frame and pull herself from Tooms' grasp)

(Mulder pulls up outside Scully's apartment block)

(Tooms forces himself out through the vent and Scully, on the floor, backs off into the bathroom. Tooms gets up and follows her in and sits on her. Scully tries to hit Tooms but he blocks it, but she punches him with her other hand)

(Mulder races into the building)

(Scully pushes her thumbs into the eyes of Tooms, but he grabs her arms and pushes them to the floor above her head, exposing her stomach)

(Mulder breaks open Scully's door, and rushes in)

MULDER: SCULLY!

(Tooms, hearing Mulder, gets off Scully and breaks the bathroom window. Mulder comes into the bathroom and points his gun at Tooms. Scully gets up and grabs Tooms before he can get out the window, but Tooms grabs Scully by the throat and tries to choke her. As he does this, Mulder puts handcuffs on one of Tooms' wrists. Tooms elbows Mulder, knocking him to the ground, and turns to advance on him. Scully grabs the handcuffs, stopping him from getting closer to Mulder and then pulls the handcuffs to the bath taps. Scully feeds the handcuffs through the taps, Tooms tries to stop her, but Scully grabs his other hand and fastens it in the other handcuff. Mulder gets up and points his gun at Tooms, who is tugging at the handcuffs)

You alright?

(Scully is leaning against the wall, breathing heavily. She manages a nod of the head)

He's not gonna get his quota this year.

(Tooms stops pulling at the handcuffs and accepts defeat)




SCENE 16
LYNNE ACRES RETIREMENT HOME
BALTIMORE, MD
(Frank is reading an article, on the front page of a newspaper, about `the consequences of ethnic cleansing'. Shaking his head he opens the newspaper and notices a small article about Eugene Tooms at the bottom of the page)

(We see the article of Tooms again, only this time it is being ripped. As the torn piece of paper is lifted up, we see it is Tooms who has ripped it. He licks the torn piece of paper a couple of times and crumples it up and throws it against a wall. The wall has alot of paper either already stuck to it or lying on the ground)

(Mulder is watching Tooms from outside his cell. Scully comes walking around a corner and down the corridor. She looks through the window into Tooms' cell. He is still licking paper)

MULDER: Look at him, he's building another nest.

SCULLY: You'll be interested to know that I've ordered some genetic tests. The preliminary medical exam revealed quite abnormal development in the muscular and skeletal systems, as well as a continually declining metabolic rate. It dips way below the levels registered in deep sleep. Did you hear what I said Mulder?

(Tooms has stopped what he was doing and is now looking at Mulder watching him)

(Tooms, stops looking at Mulder and continues with his nest)

MULDER: All these people putting bars on their windows, spending good money on hi-tech security systems, trying to feel safe. I look at this guy and I think, "It ain't enough".

(We see Tooms, licking more paper, through the window)

(Scully turns to Mulder and they both walk off down the corridor. As they go around the corner, a guard opens a door, at the end of the corridor, for an orderly, who is carrying a meal on a tray. The orderly walks to the door to Tooms cell. Tooms, who is stil licking paper, turns his head to the door when he hears a lock opening. A small opening in the door appears and the orderly slides the tray through, then locks the outside flap and walks away)

(Sometime later)

(Tooms is sitting on his bed staring at the small opening in the door, where the food tray was placed earlier. The camera switches between Tooms and the opening in the door, and zooming in on both in turn. As the camera gets closer to Tooms' face, a smile appears across his face as he studies the opening in the door)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
(It is a dark night and there is a campfire going, a young boy and girl are sleeping in their sleeping bags outside a camper van, beside a lake. Inside the van sleeps the mother, and all is quiet. We see there is a bag of shells on a table, the tap is dripping and a cup of coffee sits on the table also. Suddenly the cup starts shaking, the mother wakes up as we see it's the whole van that is shaking. She falls out of her bunk and hits the floor hard, a cupboard opens and all the plates and cups shake off the shelf. A bright light is coming in through the windows, the woman is sitting on the floor backed against a wall and screaming. As suddenly as the shaking started, it stops)

DARLENE MORRIS: Kids!

KEVIN MORRIS: MOM! MOM!

DARLENE MORRIS: Kevin!

KEVIN MORRIS: MOM! (The woman crawls towards the door of the camper and as she puts her hand on the handle, she burns her hand) MOM! MOM! (The woman looks around and finds an oven glove which she puts on) MOM! MOM! MOM! (As the woman opens the door, her son, Kevin, is standing at the bottom of the steps in front of the door) MOM! Ruby's gone.

(The woman comes out of the camper and takes Kevin's hand)

DARLENE MORRIS: Ruby! RUBY! (The woman runs to both sides of the camper calling out her daughter's name) RUBY! RUBY! (The woman stops and looks straight up into the night sky) RUBY!




SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.
(We see the outside of the building and then we see Scully in Section Chief Scott Blevins' office. He hands Scully a green file)

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder's latest 3-0-2, requesting assignment and travel expenses for the both of you.

SCULLY: Sioux City, Iowa. That's the first I've heard of it.

BLEVINS: It came up through channels, from Mulder's Asat, to the district G-14 and onto my desk.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

(Inside the file, attached to the 3-0-2, is an article cut out from a
paper with the headline `TEEN TAKEN FROM TENT BY ALIENS')

BLEVINS: In essence, Mulder is petitioning the bureau to assign a case number to a tabloid headline.

SCULLY: He must have more evidence than..

BLEVINS: Not according to his 3-0-2, he doesn't.

SCULLY: I admit, that is strange. Even for Mulder.

(Blevins gets up and takes a file out of a filing cabinet)

BLEVINS: Perhaps, it has something to do with this, take a look.

(He walks in front of the desk and gives the file to Scully)

SCULLY: An X-File.

(Scully opens the file and inside we see the following information:)

Name Samantha T. Mulder Address 2790 Vine Street City Chilmarc, Mass. Place of Birth Chilmarc, Mass. Date of Birth January 22, 1964 Nationality American

(Below is a picture of a young girl. More information reads as:)

REMARKS: Name and address of nearest relative notified in case of emergency.

Fox Mulder (brother) c/o F.B.I. Washington Bureau

(There is also a signature below)

(Scully sits down)

BLEVINS: Has he shared any of this with you? There's no need to protect him, he's the agent of record, he initiated the file himself.

SCULLY: She was his sister, she disappeared twenty-one years ago, he was, twelve and she was eight. He claims that he was in the room when it happened. He recalls a, bright light outside the window and er, and a presence in the room.

BLEVINS: In your opinion, has Agent Mulder's personal agenda clouded his professional judgement?

SCULLY: In my opinion, no.

BLEVINS: But you can see, how it might appear that way. (Blevins goes behind his desk and sits down) As you know, Agent Mulder's pre-occupation with fringe matters has been a big source of friction in the bureau, this is another case in point. I'm gonna disallow the 3- 0-2.

SCULLY: With respect sir, at least let me talk with him, and make a recommendation.




SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE
(Scully is pacing talking to Mulder, who is sitting at a desk)

SCULLY: It just doesn't seem, substantial enough to warrant an investigation.

MULDER: Ok Scully, so we disagree, it's not the first time and it won't be the last.

SCULLY: Well, at least if we had a legitimate source, we could..

MULDER: This is the essence of science, you ask an impertinent question and you're on your way to a pertinent answer.

SCULLY: But what makes this case anymore credible, than...(Scully lifts a copy of National Comet, from were the article attached to Mulder's 3-0-2 was taken, off Mulder's desk and reads another cover feature)...the hundred year old mother with the lizard baby?

MULDER: Because, the lizard baby, wasn't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee.

SCULLY: Oko-what?

MULDER: Bogee. (Mulders get up and talks right into Scully's face) Okobogee.

SCULLY: Is that supposed to mean something to me?

(Mulder turns off the lights)

MULDER: If you know anything about trout fishing, or UFO hotspots.

SCULLY: Define hotspot.

(Mulder turns on a slide projector and we see a UFO on a projection screen)

MULDER: Four sightings in 1967, August, including one by a national weather service plane. (Mulder clicks to a bigger picture of the UFO) This is a light blasted, digitally enhanced enlargement.

SCULLY: The pilot took that photograph?

MULDER: Try a girl scout with an instamatic. Four of the nine girls in the troupe claim to have seen something, five if you include the den mother. The Air Force said it was a weather balloon caught in a wind sheer. But there wasn't a weather balloon launched that day within seven hundred miles. (Mulder turns off the slide projector and gets a file which he gives to Scully) Now read me the names of those girl scouts from 1967.

(Mulder turns on an overhead projector and walks off out of sight)

SCULLY: Lisa Tyrell, Bonnie Winston, Dorreen McAllister, Darlene Mor...

(Mulder attached to his 3-0-2)

MULDER: It's the same Darlene Morris.




SCENE 4
SIOUX CITY, IA
(Mulder and Scully pull up to a house in a car, they get out and approach the house. Mulder knocks on the door)

SCULLY: Miss Darlene Morris? (Scully shows her id) I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder, we talked with you on the phone last night.

DARLENE MORRIS: Er, please come in. (They enter the house) Well I, knew that if I screamed, loud and long enough that, someone would listen. But I never expected the FBI. Er, this is Kevin. Kevin, say "hi". (Kevin is sitting at a table in the next room) Would you like some coffee?

SCULLY: Hmmm.

(Darlene walks off to the kitchen, Scully walks towards the next room when she looks behind her at Mulder. Mulder is looking at some of the pictures on the mantel, pictures showing Ruby. Mulder touches a photo of Ruby as a young girl)

(Darlene, Scully and Mulder are sitting in the kitchen)

DARLENE MORRIS: Somedays I can't even, get myself up out of bed. And, Kevin has been acting so strange, er, I don't know what to do anymore. I, I just, want her back again.

SCULLY: Miss Morris, during the divorce, was there a custody battle?

DARLENE MORRIS: Charles had nothing to do with this.

SCULLY: How can you be so sure?

DARLENE MORRIS: Because I know what happened. It's just like it was before.

MULDER: Summer of 1967, the girl scout troupe?

DARLENE MORRIS: How did you know about that?

MULDER: Your name's on record at the center for UFO studies in Evanston, Illinois.

DARLENE MORRIS: Really?

MULDER: Yea, pilot for the national weather service made a similar sighting over the same area on the same day.

DARLENE MORRIS: They took her didn't they Mr. Mulder?

(There is a long pause)

MULDER: You, you said that erm, Kevin was there, the night it happened.

DARLENE MORRIS: He didn't see anything, he was asleep.

MULDER: Do you think I might talk to him anyway? (Darlene nods her head) Thanks.

(Mulder gets up and walks away)

DARLENE MORRIS: You know, I've told this story so many times now, oh to the newspapers and the police. And everytime I tell it, people get this, look in their eye, just like the look that you've got right now.

(Kevin is sitting in front of a TV which is untuned to any channel)

MULDER: Hey buddy! Mind if I sit down? (Kevin shrugs his shoulders) Thanks. (Mulder sits on the end of a coffee table) Your mom tells me you've been having nightmares.

KEVIN MORRIS: I guess so.

MULDER: Wanna tell me about `em?

KEVIN MORRIS: No.

MULDER: Alright. (Mulder notices Kevin is writing on a pad) Whatta you doing? (Kevin turns round to look at Mulder and then turns back to his pad and continues writing) Are you making something? (Kevin nods his head) Can I take a look at it? (Kevin lifts his pad and passes it to Mulder) Thanks.

(When Mulder looks at the pad all he sees are ones and zeroes written continously down the page)

(Kevin points towards the tv)

KEVIN MORRIS: It's coming from there.

MULDER: The TV?

(Kevin stops pointing at the tv and nods his head)




SCENE 5
SIOUX CITY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
(A fax is being sent out on headed paper. The information on it reads:)

DATE: AUG 26
FROM: FOX MULDER
TO: DANIEL BERNSTEIN
REPORTING TO: CRYPTOGRAPHY SECTION, F.B.I. WASH. D.C.
(Mulder is talking on a phone, Scully is in the Sheriff's office talking to the Sheriff)

MULDER: I don't know what it is, maybe a binary sequence of some kind. Could be anything, could be nothing. I know you're busy, look erm, I know a friend who knows a friend who knows a friend who-oo can get you tickets to a Redskins game. You got it. Alright, you know where to find me? Thanks Danny.

(Inside the Sheriff's office, the Sheriff walks around to sit behind his desk)

SIOUX CITY SHERIFF: So, as I was telling your partner, we found no evidence of kidnap, no phone call, no ransom note, and since we didn't turn up a body....

MULDER: You assume she ran away.

SHERIFF: Well, it wouldn't be the first time Ruby Morris ran away from home.

MULDER: Well, how do you explain what her mother saw?

SHERIFF: Well I think that Darlene has a very active imagination. I've been listening to those stories since the first grade.

MULDER: So basically you ignored her statement.

SHERIFF: I included it in my report.

MULDER: But you didn't bother to check it out.

SHERIFF: We went out to the camp sight, we didn't find anything. Let me tell you something, Darlene's little girl was no prom queen. I can't count the number of times I pulled her out of parked cars, or found her puking her guts out by the side of the road, it was just a matter of time before...

MULDER: Before what?

SHERIFF: Before something bad happened to her and if Darlene needs to make up crazy stories to get past that, fine. But don't tell me to treat it as the truth, I not gonna waste my time.

(Mulder and Scully leave the building)

SCULLY: I just think it's a good idea not to antagonise local law enforcement.

MULDER: Who me? I'm Mr. Congeniality.

SCULLY: You never know, we might need his help one of these days.

MULDER: I'll send him a bunt cake.

(As Mulder walks around the driver's side of their car, he notices a piece of paper stuck under the window wiper. He takes it and opens it, it reads `I'M ACROSS THE STREET FOLLOW ME'. Mulder hands the note to Scully, who after reading it looks around to see who left the note. They see a girl across the street, and when she sees that Mulder and Scully have noticed her, she walks away. Mulder and Scully follow her into a library)

(As they enter the library, they look up each of the aisles until they find the girl standing at the end of one. As they approach, the girl moves into the next aisle and talks to Mulder and Scully through the books)

TESSA: You're looking for Ruby, right?

SCULLY: That's right. Who are you?

TESSA: Doesn't matter.

SCULLY: Are you a friend of Ruby's?

TESSA: Ruby didn't have friends, she just had people she liked to hang with.

SCULLY: And she liked to hang out with you?

TESSA: Guess we had some times.

MULDER: Like the night she disappeared?

TESSA: It was Greg, she was supposed to see him that night.

MULDER: Who's Greg?

TESSA: Her boyfriend, Greg Randall. Supposed to meet up at the lake. Had stuff to talk about.

MULDER: What kind of stuff?

TESSA: Greg got Ruby pregnant. I don't know, whatever, she got herself pregnant.

SCULLY: Do you know what they were planning to do about it?

TESSA: Gonna leave town, least that's what Ruby told me.

SCULLY: You know Greg from School?

TESSA: Greg, school, I don't think so. All he ever did since we met him was pour beer, The Pennyslvania Pub.

(A woman knocks some books off a shelf, Mulder and Scully turn to see what the noise was but when they turn back to talk to Tessa, she's gone. They look in the next aisle but she's gone)




SCENE 6
THE PENNSYLVANIA PUB
(Outside the pub is alot of parked motorbikes, inside most people are wearing leather jackets. Mulder and Scully make their way across the floor to the bar. A comment is made about Scully, refering to her as a `real' girl)

MULDER: `scuse me. Do you know where we could find Greg Randall?

PENNSYLVANIA PUB BARTENDER: Who's asking? (Mulder takes out and shows his id) What kind of trouble's he got himself into now?

MULDER: Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.

BARTENDER: Greg called in sick about three weeks ago man, I haven't seen or heard from him since.

MULDER: Any ideas where he might have gone?

BARTENDER: No, but if you find him, you tell him he's fired.

SCULLY: This is the motel we'll be staying at if you hear of anything.

(Scully gives the bartender a card with the details of where they are staying. The bartender looks at it and puts it in his waistcoat pocket. As they are about to leave, Mulder notices a tattoo on the
bartender's arm)

MULDER: Hey, that's a nice tattoo, what is that?

BARTENDER: What's it look like?

MULDER: Flying saucer. You don't really believe in that stuff do ya?

BARTENDER: I take it you don't.

MULDER: No, I think it's all just a bunch of crazy people howling at the moon.

BARTENDER: So er, you haven't been out to Lake Okobogie, have ya?

MULDER: No I haven't, why?

BARTENDER: You should ride with us sometime, you might see somethings that'll change your mind. (The bartender pulls back his hair to show his ear. It looks like the skin has been badly burned) Get a killer sunburn in the middle of the night.




SCENE 7
STAY `N SAVE MOTOR INN
5:30 A.M.
(Scully is sleeping in her room, shadows move across her body. When she wakens she sees figures standing outside her door and she hears whispers)

VOICE 1: Yeah.

VOICE 2: ..downstairs.

VOICE 3: Alright.

(Scully sits up in bed watching the figures outside her door. The door handle is turned but it is locked. Scully sees her gun on a dresser on the other side of the room and gets out of bed to get it. As she puts her hand on it, the door is busted open and a man shines a light in her face)

FOURTH MAN: Where's Mulder?

(A man, Holtzman, and the man who initially bust into Scully's room, are now in Mulder's room. Mulder is sitting on the edge of his bed)

HOLTZMAN: Where did you get the document?

MULDER: Well, if you explain to me what you're talking about, maybe I can help you out. (The fourth man hands a sheet of paper to Mulder) This is a document? Just looks like a bunch of ones and zeroes to me.

HOLTZMAN: Tell me where you got it.

MULDER: Tell me what it is.

HOLTZMAN: Keep playing games Mulder, I'll haul your ass up in front of the D6. You can explain to them, what you're doing obstructing justice.

(Mulder gives the sheet of paper to Holtzman)

MULDER: It's your call Holtzman. So unless they tell me otherwise, I'm not accountable to anybody outside my sub-committee. I don't care if it's the NSA or the Vatican Police.

(Mulder puts walks to a chair and lifts his shirt, which he puts on)

HOLTZMAN: It's a defence satellite transmission.

MULDER: You're kidding.

HOLTZMAN: Just a fragment but highly classified, we need to know where it came from.

MULDER: Well sure, I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

(A ringing noise is heard, and the fourth man lifts his cellular phone)

HOLTZMAN: That's it Mulder, you just bought yourself a oneway back to Washington.

(Mulder and Holtzman wait to find out the outcome of the call)

FOURTH MAN: We got it.

(The fourth man and Holtzman leave Mulder's room)

MULDER: Great.

(Scully enters)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: You shouldn't have told them. They have no jurisdiction.

SCULLY: Mulder, they're NSA. (Mulder puts on his jacket) They think the boy may be a threat to national security.

MULDER: C'mon, how could an eight year old boy, who can bearly multiply, be a threat to national security? People call me paranoid.

SCULLY: Well how did Kevin obtain top secret information? And, where do you think he got it from?

(Mulder walks past Scully and out of the room)




SCENE 8
DARLENE MORRIS' HOUSE
KEVIN'S ROOM
(A group of men can be seen filling boxes with Kevin's stuff. The fourth man is flicking through Kevin's books and then dropping them on the floor when he doesn't find what he is looking for. Kevin's drawings are ripped off the wall)

(Outside the house, Mulder and Scully have arrived. They walk up to the front of the house, all the neighbours are gathered around the house to try and find out what's going on)

AGENT: Watch your step, ma'm.

(Two men are escorting Darlene and Kevin out of the house, past Mulder and Scully and to waiting cars)

DARLENE MORRIS: It'll be ok baby, don't worry. It'll be ok.

SECOND AGENT: Come with me son.

(One agent takes Darlene to one car while the other agent takes Kevin to another car)

KEVIN MORRIS: MOOOMMMM!

SECOND AGENT: Get in the car please.

(Kevin is put into the back of a car)

DARLENE MORRIS: It'll be alright baby.

AGENT: Watch your head please.

(Darlene is put into the back of the other car. Mulder approaches the car that Darlene is in and looks in the window. It is too dark to see inside, both cars drive off. Mulder and Scully enter the house)

(A set of papers containing binary codes is lifted out of a drawer by Holtzman, who flicks through them before nodding his head. Mulder enters the room and lifts up a broken piggy bank and puts in on a dresser)

MULDER: You guys do really delicate work.

HOLTZMAN: Let's get this to cryptography. (Holtzman gives the papers to the fourth man and walks past Mulder, then Scully and out of the room, followed by the other agents) I think we got what we needed, thank you.

(Mulder pulls back the curtain and looks out the window. Noticing Mulder is looking at something in particular, Scully comes over to the window)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: I'm not sure.

(Mulder walks away and Scully continues to look out the window, she sees the top of the camper van is black)

(Mulder sets a pair of ladders against the van and climbs up, Scully is watching him from the window. Mulder scrapes and takes a piece of the burned roof of the camper in his fingers, and crumples it into ash. He smells it before flicking it from his hands)




SCENE 9
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS
SIOUX CITY, IA
(Mulder and Scully are talking to another agent)

LEZA ATSUMI: We scanned all seventy-seven pages through the mainframe in Washington.

SCULLY: And none of the information is actionable?

LEZA ATSUMI: Other than the satellite transmission, nothing can be construed, in anyway, as a national security risk. As far as I know, the boy's being released this afternoon.

SCULLY: So it's just a random set of ones and zeroes.

LEZA ATSUMI: On the contrary, there was nothing random about it.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

LEZA ATSUMI: All information can be rendered digitally, (Agent Leza Atsumi sits down at her computer) in a series of ones and zeroes. When we downloaded the data, we found an amazing range of...(Leza types in a command on the computer, The screen shows a binary sequence and in the center of the screen is a message reading: CMMD: DNLD.CURRENT FILE) Well see for yourself. (A part of a picture comes up) Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. (The screen reverts back to binary, Leza types in another command and up comes a rotating object) A DNA double helix. Oh, there's lots more. (Leza types in another command and up comes a soundwave bar and as a line travels across the bar, a piece of music is heard)

SCULLY: That's from the Brandenburg concertos.

LEZA ATSUMI: But they're just fragments, a few notes here, a few notes there. A line from the Koran, a Shakespearean sonnet...

MULDER: Almost like someone's switching channels, huh.

(Mulder looks at Leza and then at Scully but no one has an answer)

(An agent escorts Darlene and Kevin out of Holding Area 107, and then lets them go. Darlene walks passed Mulder and Scully, ignoring them)

MULDER: Mrs. Morris.

DARLENE MORRIS: I have nothing to say to you.

(Mulder chases after Darlene touching her arm)

MULDER: Mrs. Morris, please give me a minute to explain.

(Darlene stops and turns round, then she bends down and talks to Kevin)

DARLENE MORRIS: Would you please just wait right over there for momma, I'll be right there. (Kevin looks up at Mulder and then walks to where Darlene asked him to wait. Darlene stands up and faces Mulder and Scully again) I thought you were both supposed to be here, to help us.

SCULLY: This has been a terrible mistake. And I assure you that the government will pay for all repairs and damages.

DARLENE MORRIS: I don't want your money, I want my daughter back. And I want you to leave us alone.

MULDER: But your son, has seen something.

DARLENE MORRIS: You stay away from me, and you stay away from my child. (Darlene walks away, Kevin is staring up at the security monitors) C'mon honey, it's ok, let's, let's go now.




SCENE 10
EXIT 68. SIOUX CITY DOWNTOWN
(Mulder and Scully are driving along the road)

SCULLY: I thought we were headed back into town. (Mulder shakes his head slightly) Where are we going?

MULDER: The boy's the key Scully, I know it.

SCULLY: The key to what?

MULDER: Finding Ruby. Just think about it for a minute, this is a boy who is receiving all kinds of digitised data from a television screen.

SCULLY: Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration.

(Mulder shakes his head again)

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Ok, I admit it, it's not much of an explanation but it..

MULDER: I think that Kevin is a conduit, of some kind.

SCULLY: A conduit.

MULDER: A link, or a connection, to whoever, or whatever, took Ruby that night.

SCULLY: But how?

MULDER: If there was an abduction, it's likely that Kevin was touched in some way.

(There is a brief pause)

SCULLY: Mulder I know what you're thinking. I know why this is so important to you. (Mulder looks at Scully) I know. But there is no evidence indicating an abduction.

MULDER: That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.




SCENE 11
LAKE OKOBOGEE, IA
CAMPSITE 53
(Scully is looking at the campfire, the sound of seagulls can be heard in the background. Scully stands up and Mulder walks by)

MULDER: According to the police photos, Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.

(Mulder walks towards the waterfront)

SCULLY: Just a stones throw from the forest wall.

MULDER: Meaning what?

SCULLY: Meaning anybody could've come out of the forest to grab her.

MULDER: Have you noticed the tree line? (Mulder points up to the trees, the leaves and burnt away from the tops and only the thin trunk remains) Evidence of extreme heat.

SCULLY: Or an electrical storm. (Mulder is looking through some shells on the waterfront) Besides which, there's nothing to connect it to the night of Ruby's disappearance.

(Mulder lifts up a piece of glass)

MULDER: That's true. (Mulder is cleaning the sand of the glass) Do you think a lightning strike could've caused this? (Mulder walks towards Scully with the piece of glass) Do you have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass? (He gives it to Scully, who rubs the hardened sand on it) Twenty-five hundred degrees fahrenheit. Something was out here Scully, something hot enough to turn sand into glass, that, singed those trees and to blister the roof of that camper.

(Mulder walks back towards the waterfront, and Scully looks around the area. As she is about to turn towards Mulder, she hears a noise and then sees a white wolf. She quietly calls to Mulder)

SCULLY: Mulder, look.

(Mulder walks up beside Scully. After a few moments, the wolf heads off into the forest, Mulder hands some papers to Scully and then follows the wolf. Mulder runs into the forest and stops when he sees a pack of wolves crowding around a group of stones. Mulder takes out his gun and fires a shot into the air, the wolves scatter off into the forest. Mulder advances towards the stones, Scully comes running to where she heard the gunshot. She stops when she sees Mulder)

What is it?

MULDER: It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it.

(Mulder starts removing the stones)

SCULLY: Mulder what are you doing? (Mulder continues to move the stones) Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene. (Mulder is still moving the stones, Scully grabs Mulder's arm) Stop.

(Mulder turns to face Scully)

MULDER: What if it's her? I need to know.

(A police officer is sectioning off the area with police tape, the county coroner is at the grave and a man documenting the scene with photographs, as well as people from the hospital morgue. There are also several police officers around the area. Mulder and Scully stand watching)

SCULLY: You ok Mulder?

MULDER: Fine.

(We see a man lying in the grave)

CORONER: Looks like a male caucasian.

(The Sheriff is standing shaking his head)

M. E. WORKER: Sir.

(The M. E. Worker hands the Sheriff the man's wallet. The Sheriff, while wearing surgical gloves, opens the wallet and takes out the man's id)

SIOUX CITY SHERIFF: Victim's name was Greg Randall.

SCULLY: Ruby's boyfriend.

SHERIFF: Ruby had alot of boyfriends.

MULDER: Before you put that away, can I take a look at it?

SHERIFF: Go right ahead.

(Mulder lifts a pair of gloves out of a case, puts them on and takes the wallet. He flicks through the wallet, there is alot of money in the back as well as a piece of paper that Mulder takes out. On the
paper is a note reading `DR. JACK FOWLER AUG. 7 - 2:30'. Mulder looks at Scully who has also seen the note)




SCENE 12
SHERIFF'S OFFICE
(An enlarged photocopy of the note comes out of a photocopier, which Mulder lifts and brings over to a desk. He switches on a desklamp and places the photocopy beside the note that Tessa left on Mulder and Scully's car. As Mulder and Scully study the pages, the Sheriif looks on. Mulder places the original note on the photocopy so that the word FOLLOW sits beside the FO of Fowler)

SCULLY: Look at that, it's her, the girl from the library.

SHERIFF: Who?

SCULLY: We didn't get her name but she claimed Greg and Ruby had run off together.

SHERIFF: Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy o mine, delivered both my kids. I could find out who had that appointment.

(Two police officers are escorting Tessa down a corridor in the police station. She is escorted into a room, a table and some chairs can be seen through the door)

SCULLY: Have a seat Tessa. (Tessa sits down and the door is shut. The letters on the door read `INTERROGATION ROOM'. Inside the room on the table, sits a tape recorder which is recording. Scully sits down opposite Tessa) We know that you lied to us the other day. We know that you had the appointment with Doctor Fowler on August 7th. We know that you're the one that's pregnant, not Ruby.

TESSA: Aah, don't know nothing do ye.

SCULLY: We can prove it Tessa, and we can prove that Greg, was the father.

TESSA: So what if he was the father.

SCULLY: This is very serious. Do you understand how serious this is? (Tessa just looks away from Scully) Now you've waived the right to an attorney, so if you lie to us here today, you could be charged with perjury.

TESSA: Promised me we'd be in L.A. by Christmas. (The Sherif is standing against the wall listening) He had a friend there, I'd never seen the ocean.

SCULLY: You said that he and Ruby were seeing each other. You said that they were planning to meet at the lake, is that true?

TESSA: Look it, I was nowhere near the lake that night, ok.

(Mulder gets up from his seat in the dark against the wall)

MULDER: Sure you were Tessa. (Mulder walks towards Tessa) You knew they were meeting, so you sat there and you waited for them. You were angry and you were jealous.

TESSA: I wasn't.

MULDER: You sat there and you waited and when they showed, you killed him first, isn't that how it went?

TESSA: No.

MULDER: You snuck up from behind him and you shot him in the back, (Mulder hits the desk with his hand) BAAMMM. (Mulder walks around the desk and stands beside Tessa) And then you killed Ruby, (Mulder hits the desk again) BAAMMM. (Mulder walks to the other side of Tessa) What was she doing right before she died Tessa? Was she pleading for her life? Was she running away?

TESSA: I didn't kill her.

(Mulder walks back to the other side of Tessa again)

MULDER: Where's she buried Tessa?

TESSA: I don't know.

MULDER: You don't know where you buried her Tessa.

(Mulder walks again to Tessa's other side)

TESSA: I didn't kill her.

MULDER: You didn't?

TESSA: SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE THAT NIGHT!

(Mulder crouches down beside Tessa)

MULDER: Well how would you know that Tessa, if you weren't there yourself.

(Mulder and Scully are walking along a corridor in the police station)

SCULLY: Mulder you're not seeing the whole picture here.

MULDER: Which is?

SCULLY: Which is that all likelihood, Ruby is dead.

MULDER: Is that your conclusion or the conclusion of the Sioux City Sheriff's Department?

SCULLY: They're searching the national park and a rescue dive team is coming in from Des Moines to drag the lake.

(Mulder stops and turns to face Scully)

MULDER: They're wasting their time.

SCULLY: Do you really think Tessa Seers is telling the truth?

MULDER: Why not, what if Ruby never did show up that night?

SCULLY: She lied to us in the library, she lied to us about her pregnancy, what makes you think she wouldn't lie to us about killing Ruby?

MULDER: Because something was out there in those woods.

SCULLY: We have a suspect in custody, we have a confession to one murder, and we have a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another. It's over Mulder. It's time to go home and turn this over to local law enforcement.

MULDER: I can't do that.

(Mulder walks off. Mulder leaves the station and Scully follows him)

SCULLY: Mulder where are you going?

MULDER: To talk to the boy.

SCULLY: Darlene won't even let you in the door.

MULDER: Well, I've gotta see him.

SCULLY: They don't wanna have anything to do with you...us. (Scully stops and call after Mulder) Mulder stop. Stop running after your sister. (Mulder stops, and then turns around to face Scully again) This won't bring her back.

MULDER: Come with me or don't come with me but until they find a body, I'm not giving up on that girl.

(Mulder walks off again and Scully stands where she is for a moment and then follows Mulder)




SCENE 13
DARLENE MORRIS' HOUSE
(Mulder knocks on the front door)

MULDER: Hello? (Mulder notices the door is unlocked, enters the house. Scully is right behind him) Mrs. Morris?

SCULLY: Kevin? (Mulder notices something on the floor and turns off the TV. On the floor are sheets of paper with binary sequences on them, they are placed in a square shape. Scully hears the kettle boiling and goes into the kitchen and takes it off the stove. She walks back into the living room and looks at the papers) Mulder. (Mulder is sitting down staring at the papers) What does it mean?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: I'm gonna check upstairs. (Scully goes upstairs and glances over the bannister, as she does she notices something about the papers) Oh my god.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: Just come up here. (Mulder goes up the stairs) Look, (Mulder looks at the papers and sees that the binary sequences make a face) it's her, it's Ruby.




SCENE 14
LAKE OKOBOGEE. NATIONAL PARK
(It is night time and Mulder and Scully are driving to Lake Okobogee)

SCULLY: This is a longshot Mulder, they could be anywhere.

MULDER: You know when I was a kid, I had this ritual. I closed my eyes before I walked into my room, cause I thought that one day when I opened them my sister would be there. Just lying in bed, like nothing ever happened. You know I'm still walking into that room, everyday of my life. (Mulder notices something up ahead) Scully. (Scully looks to see what it is, it's Darlene's camper van. They pull up behind it and get out of the car. They run to the van) DARLENE!

(Mulder opens the door but there is no one inside)

SCULLY: Look, there's a trail ahead.

(Mulder and Scully follow the trail, after a moment they hear Darlene's cries as if she has fallen. Mulder and Scully run into the forest and find Darlene crawling along the trail)

MULDER: Are you ok?

DARLENE MORRIS: It's here, I saw it.

MULDER: Where's Kevin?

DARLENE MORRIS: I couldn't keep up with him.

SCULLY: Go ahead.

(Mulder runs off while Scully stays with Darlene. Mulder runs into a clearing and sees Kevin in the distance, a bright orange light appears in front of Kevin)

MULDER: KEVIN!

(Mulder stands watching Kevin as he walks towards the light, and then runs after him. Kevin stops as the light grows bigger, Mulder is still running to catch him. The light grows into multiple, smaller
lights, and we see that the lights belong to motorbikes. As Kevin realises they are bikes, he covers his eyes and Mulder picks him up and jumps to the ground with him. The bikes drive passed Mulder and Kevin on all sides. When all the bikes are passed, Mulder sits up and lifts Kevin off the ground)

You ok?

KEVIN MORRIS: She's back.

MULDER: Kevin I'm sorry but, I don't...

KEVIN MORRIS: She's here I know it.

MULDER: Kevin I don't think she is. I know how much you want it to be her, I did too.

SCULLY: MULDER!

(Hearing Scully's screams, Mulder gets up and runs with Kevin back to Scully)

MULDER: SCULLY!

(As Mulder and Kevin find Scully and Darlene, they see another girl lying on her back)

KEVIN MORRIS: RUBY!

SCULLY: She's unconcious but she's still alive.

MULDER: I'll get help.

(Mulder runs off)




SCENE 15
SIOUX CITY HOSPITAL
(Mulder and Scully are walking down a corridor, Scully has Ruby's chart)

SCULLY: Nurse says she been awake for almost an hour.

MULDER: Any ideas what caused the coma?

SCULLY: Eerrr, there's no sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces or electralight abnormalities, but her white blood cell count was skyhigh.

MULDER: By any chance was there attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or a release of gluco-cordacoids?

(Mulder and Scully stops outside Ruby's room while Scully checks the chart)

SCULLY: Errmmm, actually both, how did you know that?

MULDER: They're symptoms of prolonged weightlessness. Shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances.

(Mulder looks through the window of the door and Scully knocks on it. Kevin opens the door.
We see Ruby lying in bed, awake)

SCULLY: Hi. (Mulder and Scully enter the room) Hi Ruby.

RUBY MORRIS: Who are you?

SCULLY: Ooh, we're with the FBI, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder.

RUBY MORRIS: My mom said you might be coming by.

SCULLY: How are you feeling?

RUBY MORRIS: Fine I guess.

MULDER: Where were you Ruby? Can you tell us?

KEVIN MORRIS: It's ok Ruby, he knows.

RUBY MORRIS: Ah, I'm not supposed to tell. They told me not to say.

MULDER: Who told you? (Ruby is afraid to say anything) Ruby, who told you?

DARLENE MORRIS: Sweetheart, you don't have to say anything.

(Darlene is standing in the doorway)

SCULLY: You're right, we should wait until Ruby gets a little stronger.

DARLENE MORRIS: Can we speak outside for a moment. (Mulder and Scully join Darlene outside Ruby's room) I think that it's best that we put all of this, behind us. I mean, hasn't Ruby been through enough already?

MULDER: I know how dis-oriented she must seem right now, but in a couple of weeks, maybe even a few days, we could..

DARLENE MORRIS: I don't want her talking to you, or anyone.

MULDER: She should be encouraged to tell her story, not to keep it inside, it's important that you let her.

DARLENE MORRIS: Important to who? I have my daughter back, I don't want anymore trouble. Besides she can hardly remember anything.

MULDER: But she will remember one day, one way or another, even if it's only in dreams. And when she does, she's gonna wanna talk about it, she's gonna need to talk about it.

DARLENE MORRIS: Like I did? Listen to me, all of my life I have been ridiculed, for speaking my mind.

MULDER: But it was the truth Darlene.

DARLENE MORRIS: The truth has caused me nothing but heartache, I don't want the same thing for her.

MULDER: It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.

DARLENE MORRIS: As far as I'm concerned, she spent the last month on the back of a Harley Davidson.

MULDER: Is that what you're gonna tell Kevin?

DARLENE MORRIS: I'm sorry.

(Darlene walks back into Ruby's room, Kevin is standing at the door. Mulder goes to follow Darlene in but Scully puts her hand on Mulder's shoulder to stop him. Darlene brings Kevin inside and closes the door. Mulder storms up the corridor)




SCENE 16
(A tape is taken out of a tape recorder and turned over and put back in and play pressed. Scully is alone in a room, voices are heard from the tape recorder)
DR. HEITZ WERBER: But your eyes are open?

(Scully is going through the X-File on Mulder's sister)

MULDER: Yeah, they're open but it's like, nothing's happening.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Try turning your head.

MULDER: I can't.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Why not?

MULDER: I don't know. I can't move, so I don't...(We see a close-up of the tape being played, on it it says: F. Mulder hypnotic regression tape session number 2B: June 16) I just lie there in bed.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Can you see your sister?

MULDER: No, but I can hear her.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: What is she saying?

(Scully lifts up a picture and looks at it)

MULDER: She's calling out my name, over and over again. (We see the picture is one of Mulder and his sister when they were kids. We see it is Mulder who is now holding the picture) She's crying out for help but I can't help her. I can't move. (We see that Mulder is sitting inside a church)

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Are you scared?

(Mulder starts crying)

MULDER: I know I should be but I'm not.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Do you know why?

MULDER: Because of the voice.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: The voice?

MULDER: The voice in my head.

(Mulder keeps down on his knees and begins to pray)

DR. HEITZ WERBER: What's it telling you?

(The camera zooms away from Mulder as he prays)

MULDER: Not to be afraid. It's telling me no harm will come to her, and that one day she'll return.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Do you believe the voice?

(The scene fades to black)

MULDER: I want to believe.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
NEW JERSEY, 1947
(It is a dark night and a single car is seen driving along a road, singing can be heard from within the car)

FAMILY: ..was his name-o, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name-o. There was a farmer had a dog and Bingo was his name-o, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name-o. There was a farmer had a dog and Bingo was his name-o, B-I-N-G-O

(Just then a sudden bang is heard from outside the car)

SON: Dad what was that? What's happening?

DAD: It's ok, it's ok, I just got a flat.

MOM: Ooh Noo.

DAD: No problem here honey.

(There is a flashlight lying on the ground shining on the car while the dad is removing the panelling to get to the wheel. The dad sets the panelling down and lifts his wheel wrench, in doing so, he knocks the flashlight down a hill at the side of the road)

Aaooh. Darn it.

(He throws down the wheel wrench and goes after the flashlight. We see the man pick up his flashlight and go back up the hill from the viewpoint of someone or something in the bushes watching him. The kids are sleeping in the car and the dad taps on the window beside his wife)

Honey, would you mind holding the light for a secaaaaaah....

(The dad is suddenly pulled backwards out of sight very quickly. The mom gets out of the car)

MOM: Paul. Paul. PAUL.

(The mom picks up the flashlight and shines it down the hill into the woods)

Where are you? Paul. What happened?

(We see the mom standing at the top of the hill holding the flashlight from the same viewpoint of something in the bushes. Next we see the the legs of the dad as he is being dragged into the woods)




SCENE 2
(It is dawn and the police are out in the woods with other men and their tracker dogs. The police officers and some of the men are carrying rifles. The dogs are sniffing on a scent when a voice calls out)
VOICE: Over here, we found something.

(The men all run off to where the voice was calling from. They go downhill and the dogs are anxious to get down)

MAN WITH DOGS: Easy, easy.

(The dead body of the dad is lying on the ground, the men look at each other)

POLICE OFFICER: His leg's been eaten off.

(Just then another voice calls out)

POLICE OFFICER 2: HEEYY, UP HERE.

(The men make their way back up the hill and run towards the area where the calls where made. Several police men are standing pointing their rifles into a cave)

IT'S IN HERE. IT'S AS TALL AS A HOUSE.

POLICE OFFICER 3: We can smoke him out.

POLICE OFFICER: And then what?

(From within the cave, we see the men all pointing their rifles into the cave, waiting)

POLICE OFFICER 2: I SEE IT.

POLICE OFFICER: He's coming at us.

(All the men begin shooting again and again)




SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
(A man is typing on a computer and several voices can be heard in the background.
We see Scully walking through a busy office)

(Mulder is sitting, staring at a centrefold in "Hanky Panky" magazine. Scully walks in the door and sees what Mulder is looking at, she pauses and then puts her case on a desk and walks beside Mulder)

SCULLY: Working hard Mulder?

(Mulder turns the magazine around so that Scully can see it better)

MULDER: This woman claims to have been taken aboard a spaceship and held in an anti-gravity chamber without food and water for three days.

SCULLY: Anti-gravity's right. (Mulder throws the magazine onto the desk) Sorry to interrupt your serious investigation, but I just heard a story that'd just about take your knees out.

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: They found a body in the New Jersey woods yesterday, missing it's right arm and shoulder. They think they may have been eaten off, by a human.

MULDER: Where in New Jersey?

SCULLY: Just outside Atlantic City.

MULDER: Not an uncommon place to lose a body part. They think it's the mob?

SCULLY: Mmma, it was a homeless man. There doesn't seem to be a motive.

(Mulder gets up and gets his coat)

MULDER: You feeling lucky Scully?

SCULLY: Relative to whom? (Mulder is looking in a drawer in his office) It's not our case Mulder, the local police are handling it. (Mulder pulls out a file) An X-File?

MULDER: Ever hear of something called The Jersey Devil?

(Mulder hands the file to Scully)

SCULLY: Yeah, it's a beast that's supposed to come out of the woods and attack cars, right. Kind of like an East Coast Bigfoot.

MULDER: Read the file about the case in 1947.

(Mulder leaves the office, Scully closes the file and grabs her case and follows after Mulder)

SCULLY: Save me the trouble.

(Mulder and Scully walk back through the busy office)

MULDER: 1947, family watches dad get dragged off into the woods, cops find dad with a few appendages gnawed off. Cops corner a large naked man in the woods and gun `im down. (They stop at a desk) Autopsy shows human flesh and bones in the man's large intestine. A beast man. (Mulder talks to someone behind the desk) Requisition for a car please.

SCULLY: Is the autopsy report in here?

(Mulder fills in a requsition form)

MULDER: No, the original disappeared from the Patterson PD's files a few years after the incident. But there is a statement from the attending pathologist.

SCULLY: Mulder it's the same story I've heard since I was a kid. It's a folk tale, a myth.

MULDER: I heard the same story when I was a kid too, funny thing is, I believed it. (Mulder hands back the form to the person behind the desk and is given a set of keys) Thanks Doreen. (Mulder turns to face Scully) Fact is, we got a cannibalised body in New Jersey, someone or something out there is hungry.

(Mulder walks off and Scully turns and looks at him)




SCENE 4
ATLANTIC CITY MORGUE
(Mulder and Scully are in the morgue looking at the body of the victim. The coroner is there holding up the sheet which covers the body)

GLENNA: Er, they say animals can develop an appetite for human flesh but, this is no animal. You see the teeth marks, just below the clavicle, they're human.

(Glenna walks off and removes her surgical gloves)

MULDER: Who found the body?

GLENNA: Park Ranger.

(Scully is examing the body while Mulder walks to the feet of the body)

SCULLY: Was he alive when it happened?

GLENNA: Well, it's hard to tell.

(Mulder looks at the toe-tag, it reads:)

CORONER'S DEPARTMENT

NAME CROCKETT ROGER CASE NO. 2272 DATE AUG 29 / 93 WHERE TAKEN FROM: N.J. STATE PARK

There's a scull fracture but no sign of a struggle, his blood alcohol level was up, probably never knew what hit him.

MULDER: Any ideas about that?

GLENNA: The size of that bite mark, I'd say.......

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I want this on the QT.

(A man walks around a corner into view, and approaches the three of them)

GLENNA: .......large adult male.

MAN: I'll do my best.

GLENNA: Er, Detective Thompson is handling the case.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Glenna?

(Scully shows her id to the detective)

SCULLY: Hi, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I don't remember anybody calling the, FBI in on this.

MULDER: Well we're not here on an official capacity, Agent Scully's a medical doctor, we heard about your victim and, she thought she might take a look.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I'm sorry, I'm gonna ask you to leave. We have an investigation.

GLENNA: For God's sakes Tommy, this is no time to get pissy.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: We have jurisdiction here.

MULDER: Any suspects yet Detective?

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I don't work for you sir, and unless you hear different from the Attorney General, er, this case is a local matter.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder, we should go.

MULDER: There's no need to get bent outta shape.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: On the contrary, I think I've been exceedingly polite.

(Mulder and the detective stand there staring at each other for a few moments, and then Mulder leaves)




SCENE 5
OUTSIDE
(Mulder and Scully walk along a street until they reach their car)

MULDER: So what's eating that guy?

SCULLY: He was perfectly in his rights. The FBI has no overriding jurisdiction in a murder case. Anyway, you'd feel the same way if someone was horning in on your work.

MULDER: Yeah, chances are he's without a clue. He'll probably be scratching his head when they bring the next body in.

SCULLY: You missed your opening Mulder, you could've really humiliated him and er, told him who the perpetrator was, The Jersey Devil. (Mulder laughs)

(Mulder stands beside the car and talks to Scully, who is standing on the other side of the car)

MULDER: Hey whatta you say, we grab a hotel, take in a floor show, drop a few quarters in the slot, do a little digging on this case.

SCULLY: You're kidding right.

MULDER: Ok, we can skip the floor show.

SCULLY: Mulder I have to be back in D.C.

MULDER: What you gotta date?

SCULLY: No, I have my godson's birthday party at 6:30. (Mulder throws the car keys across the top of the car, Scully catches them) What are you doing?

MULDER: A little poking around, maybe make a weekend out of it.

(Mulder walks off)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's a three hour drive back by myself...(Mulder waves to Scully)...in Friday night traffic, ooowh.




SCENE 6
CASINO
(We see people playing slots machines, playing at the crap tables. Mulder is standing beside a telephone, looking through a telephone directory. He runs his finger down a page until he finds what he is looking for:

PARKS SERVICES - STATE OF NEW JERSEY Parks Information - General Inquiries ....555 - 9573

Mulder lifts the phone)




SCENE 7
NEW JERSEY STATE PARK
(Mulder and a Park Ranger get out of the ranger's pick-up truck and walk a couple of feet away from it)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Found the body just over there, lying face down in the rocks. Thirty-two years with the park service, I've come across some weird stuff but I tell ye, never anything like this.

MULDER: Victim was a homeless man, you get many of them wandering around out here?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well, occasionally ar, see some but, most are scared of the woods.

MULDER: Scared? Of what?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I don't know, the devil.

MULDER: People say that's just a myth.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Depends on who you talk to.

MULDER: What do you think?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well like I said, now thirty-two years, I see alot of weird stuff. Like one time, a little over four years ago, I saw what I thought was a, large man come out of a, copse of birch trees, not, not a stitch of clothing. And he was about, sixty yards away, and he starts, sniffing the air, you know like a dog. And then he looks straight at me, and I swear he smelled me because he took off into the woods so fast, you'd swear it wasn't human.

MULDER: Really. You never saw him again?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: No, but I feel him. And, I found things, some scat, half buried like a cat's only more human. Found a half eaten rabbit with what looked like a human cuspid tooth in it. And some deer bones, looked like they'd been sharpened into tools.

MULDER: You think it might be what's responsible for the body you found?

(The ranger laughs slightly)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I got a pension coming up in a few years, you know, you say the wrong thing.

MULDER: Yeah.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Er, I'll tell you one thing, I don't ever come out here without my weapon anymore.

MULDER: How far is it into town from here?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: `Bout a mile, mile and a half.

MULDER: I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway for the next couple of days, if you think of anything, will you call me?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Sure.

(Mulder walks off down a path in the woods)




SCENE 8
SCULLY'S GOD-SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY, D.C.
(We see a gorilla mask and the wearer runs into a room, from which another kid runs also wearing a gorilla mask and carring a plastic baseball bat. He runs into a wall and falls on his back and starts to cry. Scully comes to see what has happened)

SCULLY: Oh c'mon, it's ok, it's alright, what happened, did you bump your head? Hhmmm.

(A dog is licking the birthday cake while the kids cheer at it, a woman lifts the dog onto the floor)

ELLEN: Oh Peter, stop that. (Scully comes in holding the kid who hurt himself) What, what happened?

SCULLY: Jungle warfare.

ELLEN: Aaar, I'm gonna kill that dog.

SCULLY: If the hit squad doesn't get to him before you do.

(Scully and Ellen laugh)

ELLEN: I'm so glad you're here Dana.

(Ellen hears the breaking of glass and goes to find out what is broken)

(All the kids are sitting around a table eating food, Scully lifts an empty plate and goes into the kitchen, where Ellen is washing dishes)

SCULLY: Oooh, you're amazing.

ELLEN: What?

SCULLY: You're just such a natural at all this, I don't know how you keep it all together.

ELLEN: Mommy radar.

SCULLY: Mmmm, I don't think I'm cut out for this El.

ELLEN: Dana, you went through the FBI academy, what better training could there be for motherhood. (Scully lifts out a large plastic container from a cupboard and opens it) Seriously, you're great with kids, what're you talking about.

SCULLY: When am I supposed to find the time?

ELLEN: Well first you have to get a life.

SCULLY: Ooooh.

ELLEN: And, of course, it helps if you can find a man.

SCULLY: Know of any?

ELLEN: Yeah, they're disappearing faster than the Brazilian rain forest. What about that guy you work with?

SCULLY: Mulder?

ELLEN: Yeah, I thought you said he was cute.

SCULLY: He's a jerk. He's not a jerk, he's erm, he's obsessed with his work.




SCENE 9
(Mulder is walking along the path. We see Mulder from the viewpoint of someone or something watching him. Mulder continues his walk, not aware that he is being watched)
(Scully's godson's party is still going, when there is a ring of the doorbell, Scully answers it. A man stands outside the door)

ROB: Hi.

SCULLY: Hi.

ROB: I'm Rob, I'm Scott's dad.

SCULLY: Oh, come in.

ROB: Thanks. Hey Tiger. How you doing? Are you having a good time?

(Rob crouches to talk to his son, Scully watches him and smiles. Ellen is along the hallway talking on the phone, she puts her hand over the mouthpiece and quietly says something to Scully)

ELLEN: Divorced.

(Scully looks back at Rob, who turns and looks at Scully and smiles. Scully coyly smiles, puts her head down and looks away)




SCENE 10
OUTSKIRTS OF ATLANTIC CITY
6:47 P.M.
(Mulder walks along a street filled with homeless people living in cardboard boxes. The street is littered with boxes and cars stripped of anything valuable)

MULDER: Did anybody here know Roger Crockett? (No one acknowledges Mulder's request) He was murdered two days ago. (Mulder tries to talk to a woman as she goes passed but she just ignores him) Ma'am, can I..

VAGRANT WOMAN: Hey honey, have you got any change to spare?

MULDER: Roger Crockett? Anybody?

(A man gets up and walks towards Mulder)

JACK: What d'you wanna know?

MULDER: Did you know Roger Crockett? (The man nods his head) Did you hear how he died?

JACK: Yeah.

MULDER: Any ideas who might've done it?

JACK: You a cop?

MULDER: No, I'm FBI.

JACK: I'll show you something.

MULDER: Ok.

(Jack leads Mulder through a door and into and alleyway)

JACK: I need some money.

(Mulder takes some money out ot his wallet and gives it to Jack. Jack rummages in a black bag, in amongst a sheltered area, and pulls out a piece of paper from a small plastic bag. He unfolds it and shows it to Mulder. It looks like a man, but more like a beastly kind of man)

MULDER: What is this?

JACK: Stuck in the pocket of a jacket I found.

MULDER: Does it mean anything to you?

JACK: I've seen it.

MULDER: Where?

JACK: Right here, digging in the trash..

MULDER: Here? Are you hustling me?

JACK: Swear to God.

MULDER: Who do you think it is?

JACK: I don't know, scared the hell out of me.

MULDER: Has anybody else seen it?

JACK: Oh yeah, everybody's pretty freaked.

MULDER: Anybody told the cops?

JACK: You think they don't know.

MULDER: Where're you sleeping tonight?

JACK: You're standing in my bedroom.

MULDER: You know the er, The Galaxy Gateway? (Mulder gives Jack his room key) Room 756. Go ahead.

JACK: Hey, they got HBO?

(Mulder laughs)

MULDER: Yeah, they do.




SCENE 11
ALLEYWAY
(It's night time and Mulder is sitting in Jack's bedroom with a blanket wrapped round him. As he tries to go to sleep he hears a noise, at first glance he can't see anything but he gets up and
quietly looks around)

(He notices a figure at the end of the alleyway searching in the trash. Mulder slowly advances to get a better look at the figure. Suddenly the figure starts sniffing the air, but soon continues to
resume searching in the trash. The figure then climbs over a fence and out of sight. Mulder runs and jumps up the fence and sees the figure running along a catwalk)

(Mulder then rushes out of the alleyway and into the street to see if he can see where the figure is going, as it runs along the roof of a building, Mulder whistles at it. It stops and looks over the edge of the building at him. A police car and police van approach from behind Mulder and the figure moves on. The headlights from the police car shine into Mulder eyes, the vehicles come to a stop and a police officer gets out of the car)

POLICE OFFICER: Sir.

(Mulder points up to the roof)

MULDER: You got a man up on that roof.

POLICE OFFICER: Nothing to be afraid of, we're gonna give ye a warm place to sleep it off.

(The police officer grabs Mulder by the arm but Mulder shakes it off)

MULDER: Hey back off.

POLICE OFFICER: Alright, calm down.

MULDER: I'm telling you, there's a man up on that roof.

POLICE OFFICER: Get in the car, now.




SCENE 12
ATLANTIC CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT
(Mulder is sitting in a small white room, empty except for a table and some chairs. Through a window in the door, Detective Thompson peers through before entering)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: What the hell do you think you're doing?

MULDER: Enjoying the night life here in beautiful Atlantic City.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I'll go right to the D.A.'s office if I have to, obstructing an investigation, misconduct.

MULDER: That's good, let's go see her together, and while we're at it, why don't we add withholding evidence to the list.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Whatta you talking about?

MULDER: Statements given to you describing something stalking the back streets of Atlantic City.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: This is the fishing trip they get me up at three-o-clock in the morning for. Unbelievable.

MULDER: Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight? You know it's out there.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I got a perpetrator out there. Whether it's Hannibal the Cannibal or Elmer Fudd, I've got a job, to protect people.

MULDER: Oh is that your job, or is it to keep the dice rolling, keep the tour buses rolling in. You can't fill those casinos, this town disappears like a quarter down the slot. (There is a brief pause of silence) I've seen it.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Seen what?

(Mulder reaches into his back pocket and pulls out the piece of paper with the drawing of the creature. He unfolds it and shows it to Detective Thompson, who looks at it and laughs)

You've been spending too much time in supermarket check-out lines.

(Detective Thompson folds the paper up again and throws it onto the table)

This story's as old as the hills.

MULDER: Who's going to be responsible when you lose your first tourist, Detective? You are.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: No, you are sir, because you're wasting my time, and impeding the solution of this case. (Detective Thompson opens the door and stands by it) You wanna go on a safari, go to Africa. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your weekend.

(He leaves, closing the door behind him, and leaving Mulder sitting by himself)




SCENE 13
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
(Scully is walking through the same busy office, we've seen at the start, another agent calls to her from behind a desk)

AGENT: Agent Scully, Agent Mulder line three.

(Scully picks up the phone on the desk beside her, and answers line three)

SCULLY: Where are you?

MULDER: I'm not far from where you left me.

SCULLY: You're still in Atlantic City?

MULDER: Er Scully, you got anything happening this morning?

SCULLY: What's that noise in the background?

(We see Mulder is talking on a payphone outside a jail cell. In the cell is a man, bent over)

MULDER: That's a guy getting sick.

SCULLY: Mulder where are you? (We see Scully again, Mulder has just told her where he is) The drunk tank.

(Another agent is looking at Scully, she turns away and continues to listen to Mulder)




SCENE 14
ATLANTIC CITY
(Mulder and Scully are walking along a street, Mulder's clothes look dirty)

SCULLY: Well, it's not hard to see why they mistook you for a vagrant.

MULDER: You gonna rag on me or you gonna take me to get something to eat?

SCULLY: Am I buying or did you manage to pan-handle some spare change while you were at it?




SCENE 15
A RESTAURANT IN ATLANTIC CITY
(Mulder and Scully are sitting at a table, Mulder is eating a meal, he appears to be very hungry, talking at times with food in his mouth. Scully is drinking coffee)

MULDER: It moved like a cat, quick and graceful. There's no way a human could've got up on the roof that fast.

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: What's gonna happen when word of this gets back to the bureau?

MULDER: They dropped the charges, that guy Thompson, he ran me through the system just to spite me.

SCULLY: I'm talking about this Jersey Devil thing.

MULDER: I saw it, it's exactly the way the ranger described it, the way it moved, the way it sniffed the air. It's come out of the woods, probably in search of food.

SCULLY: Hyeah, I'll say.

MULDER: It was peeking through the garbage Scully, if it was a man-eater, why didn't it come after me? Probably felt threatened in some way..

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to yourself. You're already ascribing it a motive and an alibi. This thing, chewing somebody's arm off is not exactly a defensive posture.

MULDER: But you do believe that I saw something, don't ye?

SCULLY: You saw something, I'll give you that but I'm not about to go in and sell it. Not when it's nothing more than a sighting in a dark alley.

MULDER: I still got a hotel room I'm paying for.

SCULLY: Yeah well, I have got to get back to Washington by 7:30, so er..

MULDER: Another birthday party?

SCULLY: No. I have a date.

(Mulder looks at Scully)

MULDER: Can you cancel?

SCULLY: Unlike you Mulder, I would like to have a life.

MULDER: I have a life!

(Mulder and Scully look at each other, Scully looks away with a slight laugh)

SCULLY: C'mon, I have somebody I want you to meet, on the way home. C'mon.

(Mulder, with a mouth full of food, lifts his hand and gives a consenting grunt. He wants to finish his meal)




SCENE 16
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND
(Mulder pours himself a cup of coffee, Scully is standing, arms crossed, beside another man who is talking)

DR. DIAMOND: Just about every culture has one. Yetis, Sasquatch, Russian Almas, Dsonoqua.

MULDER: Why is that?

DR. DIAMOND: Oh, it's a kind of universal wild man myth. A symbolic fear of our dual natures as humans, as creators of life and destroyers of it.

MULDER: What's this chart?

(Dr. Diamond walks towards Mulder and the chart)

DR. DIAMOND: It shows the historic entry of man onto each continent and the effect it had on other animal species, which as you see has been disastrous.

MULDER: Why?

(Mulder goes to sit down)

DR. DIAMOND: Well, we humans have retained hereditary traits through evolution that have proven to be extremely destructive. We tend to be tribal and aggressively territorial, oriented by selfish sexual and reproductive drives that make, co-operation beyond the family-a-tribe, extremely hard for us.

MULDER: So we kill other species in order to survive.

SCULLY: Yeah, humans are top carnivores, we sit at the top of the food chain and we, reduce other species' chance of survival.

DR. DIAMOND: Nice to know Dana left here with more than a degree.

MULDER: But what if something entered the food chain above us?

(Dr. Diamond pouts himself a cup of coffee now, and walks back towards Mulder and Scully, at a table)

DR. DIAMOND: It won't happen, see our intelligence virtually insures us, barring the introduction of some alien life-form, we will live out our days as rulers of the world.

MULDER: But, but what if through some fluke of nature, a human was born, who reverted to it's most animal instincts, a kind of carnivorous neanderthal. Wouldn't he occupy a space above us on the food chain?

DR. DIAMOND: Oh sure, all he'd have to do is wait outside any fast-food restaurant and eat us on the way in.

MULDER: Right, yeah, an.and, and haven't there been cases were, men have been raised in the wilderness by animals who have no language and hunt like predators?

DR. DIAMOND: Oh yes several, but you see cannibalism is rare, even among the lower mammals.

MULDER: But even when faced with extinction?

DR. DIAMOND: Well maybe in the jungles of New Gineau or, it's just, highly unlikely that what you're suggesting could've survived civilization, a revolution, out in the woods of New Jersey.

MULDER: Yea, highly unlikely, but not outside the realm of extreme possibility?

DR. DIAMOND: Well, it would be an amazing discovery.

(Dr. Diamond nods his head a few times. Mulder looks back at Scully.
Nothing is said, but she turns to look away)




SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
X-FILES OFFICE
(Mulder is sitting, looking at some photos, in a dark room. Photos connected to the Jersey Devil, both photographs of footprints and the drawing of the creature)




SCENE 18
(Scully is sitting in a fancy restaurant with Rob. Both are well dressed and they are sitting at a table with a candle in the middle and they both have a drink in front of them)
ROB: Well the hard thing was when my wife remarried I... Suddenly I felt very competitive for my
son's attention. It was weird.

SCULLY: I'm sure.

ROB: I became a superdad on the weekends with Scott, I, had this unconscious fear of being
replaced. I actually had dreams where I was running over his step-father with my car. Well,
you'll understand when you have kids, having kids changes everything.

SCULLY: That's what they say.

ROB: Maybe some weekend, if you're up for it, we could er, take the kids out to the beach for the
day.

(A waiter brings Scully and Rob's meals to them)

SCULLY: Yeah.

ROB: Great. (Scully looks at Rob and smiles. The waiter puts Rob's meal down in front of him)
Thank you. (The waiter leaves) So, can I ask about the case you're on or, can't you say.

(Scully picks up a piece of food on her fork, looks at Rob cutting his food and pauses)

SCULLY: I don't think it's a case we should discuss over dinner.

ROB: I don't suppose you'd wanna hear about the, finer points of the state planning and taxation.

(Scully looks up at Rob and smiles, she continues to eat her meal)

(Mulder takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, he looks at the time on a clock on the wall, it is 7:55 p.m.. The phone rings)

MULDER: Mulder.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Agent Mulder, this is Peter Boulay of the Jersey Parks Department.

MULDER: Oh yeah, hi.

(Peter Boulay is talking from his rangers's truck, in what appears to be part of the park)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Hi, I found a body out in the woods today, it looks like it's been dead about six to eight months. A long haired male, missing the same tooth I found in that rabbit a while back. It could be your devil.

MULDER: Where's the body now?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I turned it over to the coroner's office.

MULDER: You're sure it was a male?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well, it had all the plumbing.

ROB: Excuse me.

(Rob lifts a small milk jug to pour into his coffee)

SCULLY: Eef-hhmmm. (Scully's beeper goes off) Sorry. (She opens her handbag and checks the message on the beeper. She closes her bag again and gets up from the table) Excuse me.

ROB: Certainly.

(The phone in Mulder's office rings again)

MULDER: Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Sorry to interrupt your evening.

(Scully is using a phone in the restaurant)

SCULLY: That's ok, what's up?

MULDER: I just had an amazing thought, maybe it isn't a beast-man we're looking for after all.

(Mulder is holding up the drawing of the creature)




SCENE 19
ATLANTIC CITY MORGUE
(Glenna is looking through a filing cabinet, and pulls out a file. She walks back towards Scully and the ranger, Mulder is walking beside her)

GLENNA: Well, if they picked it up, nobody logged the body on the chart. I sure haven't seen it.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well, I don't understand. What else would they have done with it?

SCULLY: I'm afraid we may have called you down here for nothing.

(Scully is talking to Dr. Diamond, who is also standing with the others)

MULDER: They're going to try and sweep this whole thing under the carpet.

DR. DIAMOND: Why?

MULDER: Any publicity and you're got the streets crawling with the kind of people who aren't here to play the crap tables. Word gets out there's something still on the loose, forget it.

DR. DIAMOND: You said it was a female.

MULDER: The body they found was a male, there's a fifty-fifty chance there was a mate. We may never know unless we find out ourselves.

DR. DIAMOND: If it's true, what're the chances of catching it alive?




SCENE 20
ALLEYWAY
(Mulder is cutting the wire attaching the wire fence to the metal post with a small pair of wire-cutters)

DR. DIAMOND: If it is a primate, it would have a natural fear of heights. It would also want to stay close to it's food source.

(Mulder steps through the fence and holds it back so that Scully, Dr. Diamond and Peter Boulay can get through. The ranger is carrying a rifle)

MULDER: This thing has no fear of heights. We'll stay together and start with the lower floors. How much time will that dart give us?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: It'll put down a five hundred pound bear for an hour, if I hit it.

(They all enter a building, the same building that Mulder saw the creature enter and run across the roof. It is an old building, with bars on the doors and windows, the windows have been smashed)

(Out on the street, a police car drives by and stops when the two officers inside the car notice the ranger's truck)

POLICE OFFICER 1: What the hell's a park ranger vehicle doing here?

POLICE OFFICER 2: I don't know.

POLICE OFFICER 1: Check it out.

(Both officers get out of the car, the first one walks off while the second one lifts the radio)

POLICE OFFICER 2: Run a check for me on a...

(Back inside the building, Scully is walking past some lockers while Dr. Diamond is looking at a pile of rubbish. He lifts a few empty bags and plastic covers, and then he notices something. He crouches down and picks up a piece of cloth and smells it)

DR. DIAMOND: Something here. (The others arrive at the location of Dr. Diamond, who gets up) It's blood. She could be bringing her killing here. She could be injured.

(A S.W.A.T. team member stands outside the building and turns looking at the surroundings, he is holding a machine gun and has a headpiece on)

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: Roger, zebra team in position.

(More S.W.A.T. team men gather outside an entrance to the building with one man pointing out directions for the others)

(Everyone is still looking inside, but now they are up a few floors. Mulder peers over a railing and looks down, Scully comes near)

MULDER: What if it is a female Scully? How close is she to you or me? Does she feel emotion? Or are her days just spent looking for food?

SCULLY: Maybe, she spends her day shopping.

MULDER: Eight million years out of Africa, I don't think we're all that different.

(S.W.A.T. team members are running quietly through the bottom floor of the building)

SCULLY: Mulder, we've put men into space, we've built computers that work faster than the human mind.

MULDER: While we over-populate the world and create new technologies to kill each other with. Maybe we're just beasts with big brains. (Scully is standing, not moving, a still face gazing into nothingness) What?

SCULLY: No I was just, thinking about my godson's birthday party, eight little six year old boys running around, talk about primitive behaviour.

(Mulder hears the voice of Detective Thompson and peers, once again, over the railing. He sees the detective standing talking to Dr. Diamond with a couple of police officers standing beside them)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Now look, his name is Mulder and he's a federal agent, you ever hear of him?

DR. DIAMOND: No.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: You know him?

DR. DIAMOND: No.

(Mulder puts his finger to his mouth, Scully turns and looks down over the railing as well)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Well what are you doing here?

DR. DIAMOND: I'm a professor of Anthropology.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Mulder, does that sound familar to you? Look, I know he's here somewhere. Would you check you upstairs Andrew, go check upstairs. I want this place searched...

(Mulder and Scully continue their search of the higher levels of the building. Outside, two S.W.A.T. members appear on a bridge looking into the building, they take a quick look and then run on)

(Mulder is looking through a room and stops, suddenly he hears a noise and as he looks in the direction of the noise, a figure runs past a window. Mulder gives chase, Scully hears the sounds of Mulder's feet running as she is close by. Mulder stops after coming around a corner and walks slowly along the corridor. Mulder hears Scully's voice, quiet and soft as not to arouse the attention of the police)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder where are you?

(Mulder looks out a window and sees the figure, the beast-woman, running across the top off an adjacent building. Scully is walking down a corridor, looking for Mulder as well as the beast. Mulder jumps onto the roof of the other building and as he lands, rolls over and scrambles to his feet, trying to catch up with the beast. Scully appears in the same corridor Mulder was in recently. When she peers out a window, she sees Mulder running across the top of the other building)

(The S.W.A.T team is quickly making their way up through the building)

(Scully lands on top of the roof of the other buidling, and like Mulder, rolls on landing. She takes out her gun and gets to her feet, crouching under large metal girders, making her way to where she saw Mulder going)

(Mulder is crawling slowly on his hands and feet, making no noise, trying to hear where the beast might be. The creature walks quickly and quietly across a boarded walkway on top of the roof, close to where Mulder is. As the creature goes passed, Mulder jumps up onto the walkway and runs after the beast)

(The walkway leads down some steps and into a dark building. Mulder slows his pursuit once inside the building, he reaches the bottom of the steps and enters a dark room, cautiously looking it over. Beams of light shine in through the spaces of a fan as the fan is spinning. Mulder looks along one side of a piece of machinery and then back towards the fan. Suddenly the beast jumps Mulder and they both fall to the ground. Mulder lands on his back, and lifts his head trying to see where the beast has gone and wondering what it might do to him. The beast appears from the darkness and sits on Mulder's legs. Mulder lies back, breathing heavily, waiting)

(Scully has made her way to the top of the steps, and descends slowly with her gun trained in front of her. The beast backs off from Mulder and Mulder tries to sit up, as he does so the beast-woman swipes at him, knocking him back to the ground and hitting his head. Scully approaches the bottom of the steps)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(The beast-woman runs off, Scully quickly runs down the last few steps)

MULDER: Scully.

(Mulder is sitting up when Scully enters the room, she puts away her gun, and attends to Mulder)

SCULLY: Lay back. Oh, Mulder you're hurt.

MULDER: You should've seen her, she was beautiful.

SCULLY: Yeah well, she just about ripped your lungs out.




SCENE 21
OUTSIDE BUILDING
(Mulder is sitting in the back of an ambulance getting medical attention, he is holding his shirt up while a medic attends to his wound. Dr. Diamond is sitting in the ambulance also)

MULDER: She could've torn my head off Scully but she didn't, she sensed that I wasn't a threat..

AMBULANCE DUDE: You've gotta hold still.

(Scully is talking on her cellular)

SCULLY: Yeah I need to talk somebody who can get me federal jurisdiction on this case. Mulder.

MULDER: What?

DR. DIAMOND: How old would you say she was?

(Both Scully and Dr. Diamond are talking to Mulder at the same time but he turns his attention to Scully)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: The US assistant D.A.'s on the phone with the bureau right now, he wants to know what the hell is going on up here in Atlantic City.

MULDER: Well tell him he's got a real live neanderthal on the loose. She was young, I, I, I don't know...It's hard to say exactly what, what, what...

SCULLY: The Atlantic City major crime unit has filed a complaint that we're endangering a murder investigation.

MULDER: That is such crap, you can..

(The ranger comes over to the ambulance)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Agent Mulder, they got her cornered, in a building.

MULDER: Let's go.

(The S.W.A.T. team have followed the beast-woman into another room.
One officer is talking on a walkie-talkie)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Can you see it?

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: It crawled into the walls.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Can you get a man in there?

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: That's affirmative.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: And keep these people outta here.

(Two police officers restrain Mulder as he tries to get past)

MULDER: You could take her alive.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: What's going on in there?

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: I got a man down, I got a naked woman just jumped from a second storey window. (The S.W.A.T. officer is looking out of a window as he is talking) Suspect is headed south into the woods on foot.




SCENE 22
NEW JERSEY STATE PARK
(Police officers with tracker dogs approach the woods. Mulder, Scully, Dr. Diamond and the ranger all travel to the woods in the ranger's truck. They come to a stop at the woods and they all get out
of the truck)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I know these woods, if she's going for cover, she'll be down by the rocks.

(They make their way into the woods. Meanwhile, the police are tracking through the forest slowly. As the others make their way to the top of a rockface, the ranger notices the beast-woman and points her out)

Look.

MULDER: Can you reach her from here?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I can try.

(Peter aims at the beast-woman and fires, the dart hits her in the back of the right shoulder. She pulls the dart out and continues on her way. Mulder leads the others down the side of the rockface, holding his side, and they run across a bridge. Down by the river, with the bridge still in sight, Detective Thompson comes into view. As the others come to the end of the bridge, they hear gunshots and run in the direction from where they came)

VOICES: I got it. Up ahead. I got it. She tried to take my arm off. Watch it right here.

(A man is sitting holding his arm, as Mulder arrives at the scene of the shooting, blood staining his shirt from his wound, he stops and looks at the scene and advances to the body of the beast-woman)

Right there. Looks like she was trying to bury herself.

(The beast-woman lies dead on the ground, leaves partially covering her lower back and legs. Mulder crouches down beside her and pulls back her hair and moves his hand over her eyes, shutting them. He pauses for a moment and them gets up and walks over to Detective Thompson)

MULDER: Why did you have to kill her?

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Same reason you kill a rabid animal.

(Mulder stands looking at the detective, Scully moves to Mulder and touches his arm. Mulder looks at Scully, without saying a word, Scully walks off, followed by Mulder. Peter Boulay looks from the detective to the body)




SCENE 23
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
X-FILES OFFICE
ONE WEEK LATER
(Mulder is looking at a photos of the body of the dead beast-woman, he puts them with the rest of the file into a filing cabinet. Scully enters the office carrying a file. Mulder sits down, Scully passes
something to Mulder)

SCULLY: Hi, this just came through, it's the posthumous medical exam on the woman's body. They found fragments of human bones still in her digestive tract, they estimated her age to be twenty-five to thirty years. Now they allowed Dr. Diamond to do a medical exam of the body but he found nothing that suggested prehistoric bone structure or physiology. Now the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe, and a search for her identity in state psychiatric records has begun, in earnest.

MULDER: Good luck.

(Scully gives Mulder the file she is holding)

SCULLY: They have also released the medical exam from the male body that they found, his age is estimated to be about forty years.

MULDER: There would have been offspring.

SCULLY: The medical exam of the women's uterus does seem to indicate that she may have given birth.

MULDER: She was just protecting her children Scully, it all makes sense. (Mulder gets up and gets his coat from behind the door) The male dies and she comes out of the woods in search of food.

SCULLY: Mulder will you do me a favour, will you just go out and have a beer, will you take the day off. I'll cover for you, will you just, take some time for yourself.

MULDER: Thanks for the offer but I've got an appointment at the Smithsonian with.. (The phone rings)...an ethno-biologist, I can't wait to tell him about this. (Mulder answers the phone) Mulder, yeah just a second, it's for you.

(Scully takes the phone and Mulder rushes out of the office)

SCULLY: Hello?

ROB: Hi Dana, it's Rob.

SCULLY: Oh hi.

(Rob is sitting behind a large desk, in an office or a study, books line the shelves behind him)

ROB: Sorry to call you at work, it's just I have Scott for the night and er, we have two extra tickets for Cirque De Soliel, we thought maybe you'd like to ask Ellen if you could take Trent and join us.

(Mulder approaches a reception desk at the head of a busy office)

MULDER: Requisition for a car please Fran. Thank you. (Mulder is filling out the form when Scully arrives) Who was that on the phone?

SCULLY: A guy.

MULDER: A guy. Same guy as the guy you had dinner with the other night?

SCULLY: Same guy.

MULDER: You gonna have dinner with him again?

SCULLY: I don't think so.

MULDER: No interest?

(Mulder finishes filling in the form and passes it back to Fran)

SCULLY: Not at this time.

(Fran gives Mulder a set of keys)

MULDER: Thanks Fran. (Mulder walks away from the desk and towards a door. Scully walks with him) What are you doing?

SCULLY: I'm going with you to the Smithsonian.

MULDER: Don't you have a life Scully?

SCULLY: Keep that up Mulder and I'll hurt you like that beast-woman.

(Scully stops at the door, her hand on the handle)

MULDER: Eight million years out of Africa.

(Scully opens the door)

SCULLY: Look who's holding the door.

(Mulder walks through the doorway followed by Scully)




SCENE 24
NEW JERSEY STATE PARK
(A man and a boy are walking through the woods, wearing backpacks)

BOY: Dad, did you just see something down there?

DAD: Where?

(The boy points to part of the woods)

BOY: Over there.

DAD: Naah, I'm sure it was nothing.

BOY: No, I saw something.

DAD: Hey, did you ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil? You know when I was a kid, my dad
used to tell this story about a creature who lived out down the woods...

(As the father and son walk off, the camera pans down to the ground and from a hole appears the face of a young girl. The offspring of the beasts)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES
PHILADELPHIA, PA
HOWARD GRAVES' OFFICE
(Pan along the desk. We see Howard Graves' name plate and a plaque that reads 'One to-day is worth two to-morrows Ben Franklin', pictures of Howard Graves with past and present presidents. LAUREN KYTE takes the pictures of Howard and Clinton off the wall and looks at it while crying. A co-worker, JANE, enters)

JANE: Lauren, I've been looking everywhere! (Lauren puts the picture down) Are you all right? You want some water?

LAUREN: No, I'm fine.

JANE: Oh honey, it's been a couple of weeks now. Do you want to talk?

LAUREN: No. Really, Jane, I'm OK. It's just that I don't know a lot of people who have died, that's all. I've never known anyone that's killed themselves.

JANE: Oh, maybe after everything gets packed away it will get easier. There won't be a constant reminder. Here's your paycheck. (Jane hands it to Lauren.) Come on... go home.

LAUREN: Ok. (Jane leaves. Lauren is about to leave and the plaque of Ben Franklin's saying moves on the desk. Lauren goes over and picks it up. She takes it with her and leaves.)




SCENE 2
NIGHT - ATM MACHINE

(Lauren is at the machine and makes the deposit of her paycheck. She is attacked by two men who take her into an alley. She screams)



SCENE 3
TWO HOURS LATER

(Two teens are walking by the same alley. A male and female. The male sniffs in the large garbage dumpster and waves the stink away. He looks up and sees a fire escape.)
MALE: Hey... I know a great place to crash... up that fire escape. Come on. I'll give you a boost.

(He hikes the girl on his shoulders as she tries to pull it down, but it's jammed. A body falls from above to their left and another body falls from the fire escape ladder. They are the two attackers of Lauren Kyte and the girl screams. They both run off.)





SCENE 4
BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL
BETHESDA, MD

(Mulder, Scully and another man walk into the morgue where two corpses lie under sheets on the slabs. On the other side of the room there are two women and a man standing there.)

MAN: Agent Scully, Agent Mulder, Chief Blevins assures us of your cooperation. We regret any inconvenience at this extreme hour.
WOMAN: We hope your expertise in extraordinary phenomena matters will help us in our investigation.

MULDER: You're not FBI, are you?

SECOND WOMAN: Have you ever seen anything like this before? (She hands Mulder and chart and pulls the sheet off one of the corpse's body. His arm flinches) Abnormal post mortem muscle reflex. Both corpses are still responding to high levels of electrostatic charge.

SCULLY: Any sign of external legions or surface burns?

SECOND WOMAN: None.

MULDER: Time of death? (She doesn't answer, just looks at the other two in the corner.)

SCULLY: Well, it can't be long. The body's still warm.

SECOND WOMAN: Somatic death occurred sometime over 6 hours ago. Their body temperatures have yet to drop below 98.3 degrees.

MULDER: Where did you find them? (No answer) Look, at least tell us the mode of transport. That might tell us why the bodies haven't cooled. (Still no answer from them) Hey, you called us down here. If you want some answers you have to give some. (The man finally answers)

MAN: They traveled 60 minutes by air.

MULDER: Thank you.

SECOND WOMAN: The most troubling aspect of their deaths is the throat area. (She walks over to an X Ray screen.) Larynx, esophagus, and hyoid bone all have been crushed like chalk. There is no evidence of tissue damage. It's as if their throats were crushed... from the inside. (Mulder and Scully take a close look at the X Rays of the men)

MULDER: Who are these guys? (No answer)

SCULLY: If you've conducted your investigation, why consult us?

WOMAN: Because of your work on the X Files. Have you ever seen anything like this?

MULDER: Ah, uh. Never.

MAN: Well, thank you for your time Agent Mulder, Scully. If any inquiry into this meeting be made, we request full denial.

MULDER: I'd say you people already suffer from full denial. (Mulder and Scully leave)




SCENE 5
HALLWAY
(Scully and Mulder walk down the hall outside the morgue.)

SCULLY: You lied. You have seen this before, I can tell. You lied to them.

MULDER: I would never lie. I willfully participated in a campaign of misinformation.

SCULLY: Who do you think they were?

MULDER: NSA, CIA, some convert organization Congress will uncover in the next scandal. It's not important who they are but what they have and I'm sure they have no idea because they pulled us in. I have X Files. Each case with an element of what we saw tonight. Residual electrostatic charge, internal mutilation without any external causality - but none has all the elements combined in one case.

SCULLY: How can the esophagus be crushed without the neck even being touched?

MULDER: Psychokinetic manipulation.

SCULLY: Psychokinesis? You mean how Carrie got even at the prom?

MULDER: The Russians were doing studies on it. The Chinese still are. Their findings are kept secret. (They get into an elevator)

SCULLY: Ok, I'm intrigued. How can we investigate, we have nothing to go on. (Mulder puts his arm around her shoulders and brings his eyeglasses up and exhales on them. There is a perfect fingerprint on each lens.



SCENE 6
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES - NEXT MORNING

(Lauren walks into work and scans the newspaper on a desk. Mr. Dorland's secretary comes up to her, scaring her.)

SECRETARY: Just getting in, Lauren? Mr. Graves used to let you get away with that but Mr. Dorland is in charge now. I was wondering if I could have a minute with him. (The secretary looks at his appointments. She pencils in as she talks)
SECRETARY: Tomorrow... at 3.

LAUREN: Can I see him today? It's really important. (Secretary's coffee cup topples spilling coffee all over her desk. They both start to wipe it up. Mr. Dorland comes out of his office)

MR. DORLAND: Is everything all right out here?

LAUREN: Can I speak with you?




SCENE 7
DORLAND'S OFFICE

(Lauren enters and Dorland shuts the door. Dorland motions to the chair in front of his desk)

DORLAND: Please. (Lauren sits)
LAUREN: I'm here to give my two week's notice.

DORLAND: Lauren, Jane told me about your crying in Howard's office and I wanted to tell you that you aren't alone. As a matter of fact, we share something special. Howard and I started this company 10 years ago and as long as I've known him he had no interest besides work. So we became like family. I was his brother and you were like a daughter to him. So, of course, I feel very close to you and I want to take care of my family. Stay, Lauren. Please, the company needs you. Especially now. (He reaches down and takes her face in his hands.) I won't let you leave, Lauren. (A bracelet on his wrist tightens and he flinches, taking his hands from Lauren.)

LAUREN: What's wrong? (Dorland finally loosens the bracelet.) I can't. I have to leave. I can't be here anymore.

DORLAND: You've got two weeks. (Lauren leaves his office.)




SCENE 8
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(Mulder is looking at a computer screen with a picture of one of the corpses.)

MULDER: Mohamed Amalaki. Convictions: Illegal possession of firearms. Illegal possession of explosives. Falsification of export licenses. (Scully walks around him with a file and puts it on his desk)
SCULLY: He has ties to extremist group operating in the US. The Isfahan. They take their name from a city in Iran. Recently they've been working out of Philadelphia.

MULDER: That's 60 air minutes.

SCULLY: I'll talk to the Philly P.D.




SCENE 9
BROAD STREET - PHILADELPHIA
(Mulder and Scully are in the alley of Lauren's attack with a cop)

COP: It was last Wednesday night. I was on routine patrol. This is where we found them.

SCULLY: Who discovered their bodies?

COP: Nobody. It was about 10. I was on patrol. Just saw them hanging around. The folks that come around here, they don't witness very much. You hear what I'm saying? (Mulder walks off, Scully and the cop still talking. Mulder sees an anxious woman at the ATM. She leaves and he looks at it.)




SCENE 10
FBI OFFICE

(On the surveillance film from the ATM, we see an older man taking money out.)

MULDER: A daily visual record is made of everyone who makes a transaction.
SCULLY: We'll just have to interview everyone who was at the machine before 10 last night.
(We see Lauren at the machine and being dragged off by the two attackers at 9:45.)

MULDER: There. Back up.

SCULLY: (reading in her file) Lauren Kyte. 858 Franklin, Bensalem. Why would the Isfahan being robbing someone for 40 bucks at an ATM machine?

MULDER: Look at that. (He stops the film and there is a ghostly flash across the screen. Hovering over them.)

SCULLY: It's another person.

MULDER: Maybe, maybe not.

SCULLY: Well, the resolution is too poor. It won't help much to enhance it.

MULDER: That leaves only one person we know we can talk to.




SCENE 11
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE

(She's in the process of moving. She is going to wrap glass things in newspaper when the plaque from Howard's office catches her eye on the mantle. She picks it up. She is startled by a knock on the door. She looks through the keyhole. It is Mulder and Scully)

LAUREN: Hello?
MULDER: Miss Lauren Kyte, please. (She opens the door and Mulder flashes his badge.) I'm Agent Fox Mulder and this is Agent Dana Scully. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Do you mind if we come in?

LAUREN: Um, I was just in the middle of ...

MULDER: Thank you. We won't be long.

(He squeezes through the door way and past Lauren into the house. Scully enters and smiles at Lauren, who closes the door behind them. Scully shows pictures to Lauren)

SCULLY: Have you seen either of these two men before?

LAUREN: No.

SCULLY: Take your time.

LAUREN: I'm sorry. I've never seen them before.

SCULLY: I'm afraid you have. (Scully shows her another picture) This is a surveillance picture from your ATM. (It's a picture of Lauren and the attackers. Their faces clear.)

MULDER: Can you tell us what happened that night?

LAUREN: Um... These guys, I was depositing my paycheck. They grabbed me, I got away. I ran. I just didn't want to file a report.

MULDER: They were found dead. (She has a reaction. Scully gives her another picture)

SCULLY: Have you ever seen this person before? (It's the still frame from the surveillance video of the spectral image)

LAUREN: No. I'm sorry. I can't tell you.

MULDER: Does that mean you know?

LAUREN: It means I can't tell who it is.

MULDER: When you can tell me, this is the number where I can be reached at anytime, ok?

LAUREN: Ah hum. (Mulder and Scully leave)




SCENE 12
OUTSIDE

(Mulder and Scully walk to their car)

SCULLY: A woman her size breaking free and out running those men?
MULDER: And somehow crushing their necks? (They get into the car and put on their seatbelts. Lauren is seen looking at them through her window.)

SCULLY: She knows who the other person in that photo is.

MULDER: Packing, running away, from what? ( The parking brake goes off, the car is put into reverse, and the doors are locked. Mulder tries to brake, put the car spins backward.)

SCULLY: What the hell's going on?

MULDER: Hang on! (He turns around and steers the car speeding backward, trying to brake. The car is hit in the intersection by another car. It comes to a stop) You ok?

SCULLY: Yeah. (Mulder looks over at the other driver, shaking his head wondering what happened. Lauren is still looking out the window and she pulls the drapes when Mulder sees her.)




SCENE 13
GARAGE

(Mulder is crouched at the side of the dented car. Scully walks up.)

SCULLY: Hi.
MULDER: Hi. The paramedics check you out?

SCULLY: Yeah. I'm fine. Except I have a waiting-in-line-at-the-DMV-sized headache.

MULDER: Mine's more IRS sized.

SCULLY: They check out the car?

MULDER: Yeah, it's brand new. Only a 100 miles.

SCULLY: Then someone tampered with it while we were in her house.

MULDER: Mechanic said everything is in proper order. Nothing cut, nothing greased. Check out the lights.

SCULLY: They are on.

MULDER: They're not. The filaments are heated due to massive levels of electrostatic charge. Just like the bodies at the morgue. And isn't it interesting that Lauren Kyte was present at both incidents?

SCULLY: She was in our presence the entire time we were at her house.

MULDER: What if it's possible somehow to raise a body's electrostatic charge to levels we've been seeing and use that energy to affect objects?

SCULLY: If a person could generate that much energy, their body would break down. They'd start glowing like those lights.

MULDER: Well there's evidence of this all through the X Files. Furniture moving untouched, objects levitating, unexplained electrical discharges. Frequently people who have psychokinetic power are unaware of their own capability.

SCULLY: Are you saying Lauren Kyte crashed our car?

MULDER: Either that or a poltergeist.

SCULLY: They're here... (imitation of the little girl from the movie, "Poltergeist")

MULDER: They may be.

SCULLY: Oh, come on Mulder, look at the tangible evidence. Two Mid-East extremists are killed trying to assault a woman working for a manufacturer of parts for the Defense Department. While we questioned her our car is sabotaged. Now in both those cases, someone else may have committed those acts. Maybe the same someone we saw in those ATM photos. The mystery isn't psychokinetic energy, it's her accomplice. (They both notice the lights of the car are out.)




SCENE 14
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES

(Lauren drives into the parking lot and gets out of her car. Mulder and Scully are sitting in their new rental, Mulder with binoculars, Scully going through papers.)

SCULLY: She's clean. No arrest, not even a traffic ticket. The only thing is, she's in deep with her credit card company... $15,000. (They look over at Lauren, mad at a sign painter painting over Howard Graves' parking spot with a new name, Tom Braidwood (Who happens to be a second unit director and Frohike on the show)
LAUREN: No, no. (She grabs the stencil out of the painter's hands) I'll talk to somebody, just go.

MULDER: A little upset over losing a parking space, wouldn't you say? So, who is Howard Graves anyway?



SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Scully is pouring over the microfiche film. Scully gets Mulder's attention and they read an article from a newspaper. Howard Graves Suicide Creates Shock.)
MULDER: She was his secretary. That's three people dead in the last month all associated with Lauren Kyte. (The newspaper article says Howard slashed his wrists in a bathtub.)




SCENE 16
CEMETERY - DAY

(Mulder and Scully pull up to the cemetery to see Lauren put flowers on a grave. They watch her as she sadly walks away from the grave site. They get out of the car and go to the grave she put flowers on. It's Howard Graves'.)

MULDER: You don't see too many bosses graves without people dancing on it.
SCULLY: Look at this one. (There is another maker next to Howard's that reads, \'93 Sarah Lynn Graves September 8, 1966 to August 3 1969". There's a groundskeeper planting flowers nearby.)

MULDER: Excuse me, Sir? Is there an office here so that I can get information on those people?

GROUNDSKEEPER: I attend every funeral. I'm the last person to see them put to rest.

MULDER: Do you know how Sarah Lynn is related to Howard Graves?

GROUNDSKEEPER: His daughter. They were at home one day and he didn't latch the pool gate. She drowned. His wife left him a year later. She's buried in a plot in the Northeast corner.

MULDER: Thank you, Sir.

GROUNDSKEEPER: You're welcome. (He leaves. Mulder and Scully go to Sarah's grave again.)

SCULLY: She was only three years old.

MULDER: If she'd lived, she'd be Lauren's age. (Scully looks at Mulder and he looks at her.)




SCENE 17
DARKROOM

(Mulder is developing pictures)



SCENE 18
SCULLY'S APARTMENT
(Scully is typing into her laptop)

SCULLY (VOICE OVER): Further investigation into Lauren Kyte's personal history reveals an estrangement from her family. Phone records confirm no contact with her parents for the last two years. Her actions observed during surveillance (Go back to Mulder looking at photos taken during the surveillance as Scully continues speaking) indicate a strong relationship between Lauren Kyte and her employer, the late Howard Graves. (Back to Scully typing) Was this relationship somehow the motivation for his suicide? How are the attack and the subsequent murders of the Isfahan agents related, if at all? I am certain that the answers to these questions lie in finding the identity of Lauren Kyte's accomplice. (Back to Mulder looking at the negatives of the photos. One is of Lauren Kyte's house, the next of her front window. There's a figure standing in the window.)




SCENE 19
CRIME LAB

(The photo of the figure in the front window is being put on the computer and manipulated. The framing of just the window of the photo is enlarged and we see the figure is Lauren Kyte, but right behind her is another figure. Mulder and Scully are with the computer operator.)

SCULLY: Enhance it by 10. (He does.) That's Howard Graves. He's alive.
MULDER: Not necessarily.




SCENE 20
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

(Lauren is asleep in the bed. Her cat is sitting on the end of it and hisses and takes off. We can hear banging. Lauren wakes up. She is scared. The stairs creak. Lauren slowly goes to her closet and gets out a bat. She slowly moves to the door, opens it and looks into the dark hallway. She enters the hallway and the pounding gets louder and we can also hear a man saying, 'No.' She walks down the hallway and there are other voices too, I can't make out what is said besides, 'No.' Then a reverberating 'Don't do this to me.' Lauren moves to the bathroom. The door is ajar and she pushes it open with the bat as we hear, 'No. Stop. No, no, no. Please!' She guardedly moves into the bathroom and turns on the light. The shower curtain is closed. The man's voice is now crying. Lauren pulls open the shower curtain and there is a tub full of water, with a cloud of red in the middle. It grows and soon the entire tub is full of blood.)

LAUREN: Oh, Howard. (The tub drains)



SCENE 21
NATIONAL BUREAU OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS
PHILADELPHIA, PA

(Scully and Mulder walk down a flight of steps in a stairwell.)

SCULLY: I think Howard Graves faked his own death.
MULDER: Do you know how difficult it is to fake your own death? Only one man has pulled it off, Elvis.

SCULLY: He and Lauren Kyte are in on something. Maybe an illegal deal through his company. Something the CIA was interested in.

MULDER: You may be right. (They get to the door to the office of Ellen Bledsoe, ME.)

SCULLY: Wait, you think I'm right?

MULDER: Sure, all you got to do is prove that Howard Graves is still alive. (He knocks on the door.)




SCENE 22
ELLEN BLEDSOE'S OFFICE

(We see a dour black woman's face, Ellen Bledsoe, I presume.)

ELLEN: Howard Graves is very dead.
SCULLY: May we see the autopsy report, please? (Ellen tosses it across the desk)

ELLEN: Knock yourself out. (Scully reads the report)

SCULLY: Cause of death... arterial hemorrhage...

ELLEN: 4 to 6 liters of blood down the tub.

SCULLY: Well there seems to be some blood work missing here.

ELLEN: We only do that when we suspect homicide.

MULDER: I don't suppose you ran any dental conformation?

ELLEN: What for? It was him.

SCULLY: How did you know?

ELLEN: It said so on the toe tag.

MULDER: Who made positive ID on the body? (Scully looks through the report again.)

SCULLY: Lauren Kyte.

MULDER: But Howard Graves was cremated. There would be no way to run a dental check or to get a DNA sample.

SCULLY: Yes, there is. His body's tissues and organs were donated.




SCENE 23
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL

(Mulder and Scully and another man in a lab coat are standing in a hallway looking through a window to the Cryogenics lab while the man talks. There are lots of people working in the lab.)

MAN: Howard Graves is in 5 different people. They harvested his organs immediately after death. His kidneys were sent to Boston, his liver to Dallas, and his corneas to Portland, Oregon. They've all been transplanted. Because of his age, we could only cryo-preserve the dura matter, the membrane of the spinal column. We have Mr. Graves' hospital records, we'll extract a sample, run a test and in a couple of hours... confirm the identity of the donor.



SCENE 24
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES
PHILADELPHIA, PA

(There's a party going on. Balloons, champagne hats, lots of people, music, etc.)

JANE: I knew you would rush, so I made sure to have your check before you leave. (She hands it to Lauren) Oh, I'm going to miss you. (They hug. Jane gets teary eyed. Lauren smiles and gives her a glass of champagne.)
LAUREN: What? Here.

JANE: Bye.

LAUREN: Bye. (Lauren walks away from her. She goes to her desk which has all her stuff in a box. She puts her desk nameplate in it. She takes the box and starts to leave, but turns and goes into Howard's office instead, careful to see no one was watching her.)




SCENE 25
HOWARD GRAVES' OFFICE

(The office is bare of all personal effects from the beginning of the show. The bare furniture is all that's left. Lauren looks around the office and is startled when the door shuts. She turns and sees Dorland leaning back to the door and smiling.)

DORLAND: You're going to leave without saying goodbye? Well, I've come to say goodbye... to wish you luck, and to leave you with this little thought... I know Howard told you and if it ever gets out, I won't waste my time trying to pin the source. I'll go straight to you.
LAUREN: And you'll do to me what you did to Howard? I know you had him killed.

DORLAND: Why would you say that?

LAUREN: He told me. (She takes her box off the desk and goes to the door, but Dorland grabs her. They jostle and Lauren gets out of the office and walks away. She walks into the party and uses the phone)




SCENE 26
UNIVERSITY OF PA OFFICE

(Mulder and Scully are reading and fidgeting. Mulder's cell phone rings. While he answers it, the lab guy enters and talks to Scully.)

MULDER: Mulder. (Cut between Lauren and Mulder)
LAUREN: It's Lauren Kyte. How soon can you get to my house?

MULDER: Why?

LAUREN: Please hurry. (She hangs up and takes her box and leaves. Dorland stands in Graves' office doorway watching her)

SCULLY: The tests are conclusive, the dura matter does belong to Howard Graves. He is indeed, very dead. (Mulder gets up and walks away)




SCENE 27
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE

(Lauren walks down stairs. She has her suitcases and puts them on the dining table. She finishes up packing up things at her desk. A car with a man and a woman pulls up outside her house. They get out and walk to the front door. Inside, Lauren is pacing. There's a knock on the door. She is relieved and walks across her empty house to the door. She opens the dead bolt. It slides closed again.)

LAUREN: Just a second. (She opens it again, she hears a noise behind her. She jumps out of the way of a kitchen chair that moves across the house and wedges itself under the door knob. The door flies open and the man and woman enter. The man has a switchblade in his hand.)
MAN: Go run the bath. (Lauren falls back into the living room floor.)

LAUREN: Get out of here! (The bulbs in the lamps around the room shatter. The man grabs Lauren and a table slams into him. She gets away. The only light in the room is coming from the window. A spectral presence moves from the dining room to the front door where the woman sees it and tries to get out of the house.) No! (The woman is flung to the door. Her neck is crushed. Lauren screams no as the woman falls to the ground. The man gets out from between the table and fireplace and runs to the door but is flung back on the floor. He looks all around. He stands up. He gets punched in the face, drawing blood but there are no hands. It's like Lauren can't move from where she stands. She screams some more. Mulder and Scully drive up outside. They hear screams from inside the house and race to the front door. Mulder pushes the woman aside as he opens the door. He looks into the living room and the man is hanging from nothing in the middle of the room. Lauren is crying. The man falls to the floor as Scully enters the house, gun drawn. They look at Lauren whimpering in a crouched position on the floor.




SCENE 28
INTERROGATION ROOM

(Mulder is sitting across the table from Lauren as Scully leans against a window ledge.)

SCULLY: You know, you're not under arrest. You're just here for questioning. The sooner you talk to us the sooner you get to go home. (Pause) What happened to those people tonight? (Lauren's not saying anything) Do you have any idea who they might be. Why did they attack you? (Mulder picks up a picture and walks around the table and shows it to Lauren)
MULDER: Do you know who this is? (The man from the beginning, the non-talker at the morgue walks in)

MAN: Scully, Mulder... He'll keep an eye on her. (He motions to an officer who enters the room after him.) Come. Now. (Scully and Mulder leave the room with him and the woman from the morgue is there too.)

WOMAN: You've seriously compromised our investigation.

MULDER: We were following leads pertaining to an X File.

MAN: I want to know every detail of your activities concerning this case.

SCULLY: What case? You're the ones who've been withholding information. (They all fall silent.)

MULDER: Then we have nothing more to talk about. (Mulder and Scully walk away. The woman and man follow them to the hallway.)

WOMAN: We believe HTG Technologies was selling restricted parts to the Isfahan. Partial serial numbers from their manifest were recovered in the wreckage of a July bombing of a Navy transport van.

MULDER: How's Lauren Kyte involved?

MAN: We don't quite know. Your actions impeded our investigation.

WOMAN: In any case, we don't have enough evidence to hold her. If she doesn't talk, she goes free and we lose our chance to break this company.

MAN: I could make her talk.

MULDER: My advise to you. Don't get rough with her.





LATER

(The door to the interrogation room opens.)

WOMAN: That was a waste of time. (The woman and man walk out. The woman keeps walking. The man regards Mulder and Scully off screen.)
MAN: Your turn. (He leaves. Scully and Mulder walk into the room.)




SCENE 29
INTERROGATION ROOM

(Scully and Mulder enter.)

SCULLY: Lauren?
LAUREN: I won't talk to you, either.

MULDER: Ok, then you're free to go. (Lauren looks up surprised and gets up from her chair. Scully throws a surprised look in Mulder's direction as Lauren walks by her. Lauren pauses at the door.)

LAUREN: I can't go back to that house.

MULDER: Why? Because of Howard Graves?

LAUREN: He's dead.

MULDER: I know. He's watching over you, isn't he?





LATER

(A tape recorder is rolling)

LAUREN: I don't know if you've ever been a secretary. Sometimes your boss can talk as if you weren't even in the room, which can hurt, you know? Sometimes... you're all he has to talk to. Which is how it was all the time with me and Howard. One night, late, I went into his office. He was crying, more scared than sad. The Pentagon contracts were being canceled, the company was going under, he felt personally responsible for each of his employees... seeing and feeling their fear every day... it really wore him down. Then this one time, Dorland came with that group... that Mid East group... Isfahan, that terrorist group. They'd buy parts at an outrageous price. Not just once, but for as long as they could get away with it. That night Howard was crying, he'd just found out the Isfahan had just claimed responsibility for killing a couple of sailors in Florida. He was never the same. And I thought that was why he killed himself. But he didn't... I saw ... Howard showed me how Dorland had him killed. Made it look like a suicide because he see Howard was going to put an end to the deal.
MULDER: So now Howard is protecting you?

LAUREN: It sounds so ridiculous.

SCULLY: But you believe it.

LAUREN: He was closer to me than my father. I told him that. I still feel his presence. Sometimes... I even smell his aftershave. If you just could've ... seen ... the things I've seen... I just... want all that to go away. I'm leaving. Maybe he can move on. (Scully gets up from the table and go to Lauren.)

SCULLY: That's not enough. You've been given the chance to tell him again. Take it. Tell him you love him, by showing him, by... helping us finish his unfinished business. Lauren, how will you ever be able to rest if he never can? (Lauren nods.)

LAUREN: Ok. (Scully nods too.) I'm a mess. I'm um, going to wash up. (She leaves.)

MULDER: What are you doing Scully? You don't believe.

SCULLY: Mulder, there's no such thing as ghosts or psychokinesis. I'm sure there's an explanation. But I believe that she believes. And my priority is to get her to help us stop Dorland.

MULDER: Well we may have just sacrificed our best opportunity to observe spectral phenomena.

SCULLY: I'm giving us a chance to solve a case that's tangible instead of chasing after shadows.
(Scully leaves leaving Mulder to ponder.)




SCENE 30
STAIRCASE

(Lots of FBI come down the stairs, Mulder with them. He goes to Lauren standing by a car. Scully approaches.)

MULDER: You ready? (She nods. Scully addresses the troops)
SCULLY: All right, everyone. We have a warrant to search the premises for evidence of the sale of restricted manufactured parts. The evidence may be in the form of falsified export licences, parts manifests, communiques. It could be on computer disks or hard copy.

MAN: (from morgue and interrogation room) Once there, when in doubt, ask. We need this to be clean. This is the culmination of a year long investigation. If we don't come out of there today with something proving a connection to the Isfahan, this guy could walk.

SCULLY: Lets go. (The man break up. Lauren walks with Scully.) Now, it will most likely be in Dorland's office. We'll conduct the search, but we need you to guide us so we need you to be strong, okay? (Scully opens the back door of the car for her. Lauren gets in. The cars pull out.)




SCENE 31
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES

(The FBI walk into the office. Scully walks in with them with her badge.)

SCULLY: Everybody stay calm. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Ma'am, could you step away from those files, please?
(The FBI moves people around and out of the way and others start looking in files, drawers, reports, etc. Dorland comes out of his office. Scully and Lauren walk by him into his office. Mulder stays outside with him.)

DORLAND'S OFFICE

(Scully puts things into a box. Lauren searches through his bureau and books.)

LATER

(The man and woman from the morgue go to Mulder and Scully.)

WOMAN: This is all we could find.

MULDER: We don't have him. He's not even breaking a sweat. (Dorland is standing in a corner with the employees, engaging in small talk. The man walks up to Mulder.)

MAN: Our case is blown. A wasted year. This guy is going to walk. (The man and woman leave.)




SCENE 32
DORLAND'S OFFICE

(Scully walks to the door and out with a box of things taken from his office as Mulder enters)

SCULLY: Let's get out of here. (Mulder walks to Lauren still at the bureau. She is distraught.)
MULDER: Lauren, it's over. We have to go. (She looks around the room as Dorland enters.) What we're looking for isn't here. (Lauren takes a letter opener from the desk and smashes the glass in a picture frame and takes out the photo.)

DORLAND: Look! She isn't an agent. I've been more than cooperative and I don't want to be combative, but she has no right destroying my personal property. (Lauren takes a painting from the wall and opens the back. Nothing but a painting.

LAUREN: Destroying property? What about that van that blew up and killed those servicemen?

DORLAND: Oh, I don't know what you're talking about you stupid bitch! (Lauren rushes Dorland with the letter opener.)

MULDER: Lauren, No! (Dorland pushes her away and he is pushed against the wall by Howard. The door slams shut. Dorland starts gasping at his neck. He can't breathe.

LAUREN: Don't kill him. Help us find it! (Dorland slides to the floor. The track lighting explodes. The bulbs in the lamps explode. Mulder grabs Lauren.)

MULDER: Get down. (Outside the office, Scully hears the commotion and runs back to Dorland's office door. It's locked.)

SCULLY: Mulder! (Inside the office, it's dark and we hear Scully yelling. Pictures fly from the wall. Drawers open and papers fly around the room. The letter opener hovers in front of Dorland's face. It turns and flies into the wall. It slits the wallpaper about two feet and stops. The noise and flying papers die down and Scully bolts into the room. She looks around at the mess.)

SCULLY: My God. (Mulder walks across the wall to wall paper to the wall and takes a floppy disk out from behind the wallpaper.)

MULDER: I guess what we're looking for is here.




SCENE 33
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE

(A moving trailer is hitched to Lauren's car. Scully, Lauren and Mulder walk to it. Lauren is carrying a box.)

SCULLY: The US Attorney's office is going after Dorland with everything they've got. Including the murder of Howard Graves.
LAUREN: I'll come back to testify. (She puts the box in her trunk.)

MULDER: Where are you going?

LAUREN: Away from here. (Lauren gets into the drivers seat and starts the car.) Thanks. (She drives off.)

MULDER: Boy, she's in a rush to get out of here.

SCULLY: Out of here, or away from the ghost of Howard Graves? (They walk to the car.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully. Do you believe in the afterlife?

SCULLY: I'd settle for a life in this one.

MULDER: Have you ever seen the liberty bell?

SCULLY: Yes. (They get into the car and fasten their seat belts.)

MULDER: You know, I've been to Philadelphia a 100 times and I've never seen it.

SCULLY: You're not missing much. It's just a big bell with a big crack, and you have to wait in a long line.

MULDER: Yeah, (Mulder starts the car and drives off) but I'd really like to go.

SCULLY: Why now?

MULDER: I don't know. How late do you think they stay open?




SCENE 34
LAUREN'S NEW WORKPLACE

(Howard Graves' plaque with Ben's quote is on her desk. She brings a report to her new head secretary.)

HEAD SECRETARY: Miss Kyte, I asked for this 25 minutes ago.
LAUREN: I know. I'm sorry.

HEAD SECRETARY: Maybe that's the way they work back in the East, but here in the Midwest, punctuality is a virtue. (She takes the report and goes back to what she was doing. The coffee cup on the secretary's desk starts shaking. Lauren is nervous. The secretary sees it and covers it with her hands.) We really need to find a new office space. Every time a truck goes by the whole building shakes. (She takes a sip of her coffee. Lauren is relieved.) That's all Lauren. (Lauren goes back to her desk. She smiles at the plaque.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
EURISKO WORLD HEADQUARTERS
CRYSTAL CITY, VA
(High rise office building, exterior. Office with two men arguing.)

SCRUFFY GUY: Look, Ben. This is what infuriates me. Don't you see? It's so painfully obvious. Why do you think our stock's in the toilet? Because you're cutting research and development in half. You've forgotten what the adventure's all about.

SUIT GUY: (BAD dub job on the voice) Like it or not, the industry's changing. We need to make some hard choices.

SCRUFFY GUY: You save your sound bite for the press.

SUIT GUY: Let's not relive the stockholder's meeting again.

SCRUFFY GUY: Don't you get it? You're killing me! You're killing my company!

SUIT GUY: Eurisko is not your company, Brad - - not any more. And you damn well better grow up and get used to it.

SCRUFFY GUY (BRAD WILCZEK): (exiting angrily) You're going to regret this.

(Night. SUIT GUY typing from tape recorder in his office.)

SUIT GUY: (recorded) New paragraph. As I'm sure everyone on the Board will agree, Eurisko has to face head on the realities on an increasingly competitive world. (focus on camera overhead) Since the unfortunate departure of Brad Wilczek, I have made certain recommendations which I believe will reposition Eurisko as an industry leader.

(Focus on camera monitor filming SUIT GUY - COS SCANNING: DRAKE, BENJAMIN - DATA INTERCEPT)

At the top of this list, is the immediate termination of the COS project.

(COS computer monitor starts flashing little lights like the computers in the 1960's Star Trek)

It's disastrous performance over the past three quarters and projected losses well into 1994 leave us no other choice.

(COS watches SUIT GUY, DRAKE, check his watch then go into his private bathroom where he hears water running. The sink is overflowing. Drake shuts off the water and is now wet standing in a puddle. The phone rings. DRAKE answers)

DRAKE: Hello? Hello!

PHONE VOICE: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 P.M.

(Suddenly, lights go out and bathroom door slams shut. DRAKE sets down phone)

DRAKE: What the hell?

(He tires the door, no luck. He swipes his card key, no luck. He puts metal manual override key in the lock and ..... WHAMMMO!!! Huge electrical shock flings him across the room, breaking the mirror. Camera focus on DRAKE'S body.)

COMPUTER VOICE: File deleted.




SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Agent JERRY LAMANA walking through FBI office. He swipes some candy out of someone's Halloween pumpkin. He approaches MULDER and SCULLY who are getting lunch at a cart.)
JERRY: Mulder.

MULDER: (hugging him) Jerry?

JERRY: You're Dana Scully, right? (shakes SCULLY'S hand) Jerry Lamana.

MULDER: Jerry and I worked together in Violent Crimes.

JERRY: Worked together? What are you talking worked together. (to SCULLY) We were partners.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY)

LUNCH CART GUY: That's $8.50, please. (SCULLY starts to pay him)

MULDER: So, Jerry, what are you doing here?

JERRY: Looking for you. And I'm buying you two lunch.

SCULLY: No, really ...

JERRY: No, it's on me. (pays LUNCH CART GUY)




SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE
(MULDER and SCULLY listening to JERRY)

JERRY: Cause of death was electrocution.

SCULLY: And it wasn't accidental?

JERRY: It looks like some kind of elaborate booby trap, but we don't know a whole lot more. The building engineer just found him twelve hours ago.

SCULLY: Who's running the investigation?

JERRY: Do either of you know Nancy Spiller?

SCULLY: The forensics instructor at the Academy? (to MULDER) We used to call her the Iron Maiden.

JERRY: On a good day. Well, anyway she's putting together the squad and, well, I took the liberty of mentioning your name. (to MULDER)

MULDER: Look, Jerry. I'd like to help you out, but we're not on general assignment.

JERRY: Because of the X-Files? (slightly desperate, to MULDER) Look, the truth is, I could use a little help on this. I don't want to drop the ball on this one.

MULDER: You won't drop the ball.

JERRY: Drake wasn't just a CEO of a Fortune 500 company. He was a good friend of the Attorney General's. Another feather in my cap would be really nice right now, because the one I got's looking a little mangy.

MULDER: Yeah, but Jerry ...

JERRY: Look, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.




SCENE 4
EURISKO WORLD HEADQUARTERS
SCULLY: How come you two went your separate ways?

MULDER: I'm a pain in the ass to work with.

SCULLY: Seriously.

MULDER: I'm not a pain in the ass? We had different career goals. Jerry wanted the fifth floor.

SCULLY: And you?

MULDER: I was gunning for a basement office with no heat or windows.

(Security camera follows them inside the building.)

SCULLY: I know where you ended up. What about Jerry?

MULDER: He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta working hate crimes.

SCULLY: What kind of bad luck?

MULDER: He misplaced a piece of evidence, bagged and everything. Sent it to the cleaners. By the time he got it back, a federal judge had lost both his hands and his right eye.

(Elevator dings and they enter. Security camera watches them.)

SCULLY: (pushing button) Twenty-nine?

MULDER: Uh-huh.

ELEVATOR: Going up.

SCULLY: Must be for the visually impaired.

MULDER: How do you like that? A politically correct elevator.

ELEVATOR: Third floor....Fourth floor....

(Elevator slams to a stop. SCULLY falls. MULDER helps her up.)

MULDER: You okay?

SCULLY: Yeah. What was that?

(MULDER tries buttons. SCULLY picks up phone. As she does, it rings. She looks surprised.)

MAN'S VOICE: Yes?

SCULLY: Hello?

MAN'S VOICE: Security. Who's this?

SCULLY: This is Agent Dana Scully.

MAN'S VOICE: Agent Scully, do you have a problem? (Elevator begins going up again, announcing floors.)

SCULLY: Uh, actually, I think everything's okay.

(Security camera monitor reads - DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PHONE SEARCH
SCULLY, DANA 202-555-6431)




SCENE 5
DRAKE'S EXECUTIVE BATHROOM
(JERRY, MULDER, and SCULLY looking at door computer controls.)

JERRY: Someone has tampered with the servo. They switched the ground to the negative so that when he put the key in the lock...

SCULLY: ...he completed the circuit.

JERRY: It's fused. It takes a lot of juice to melt a steel key.

SCULLY: And to throw a 180 pound man ten feet. (Looks at cracked mirror)

MULDER: The, uh, servo switch. Could it have been moved manually?

JERRY: We didn't find any prints in the surrounding area.

(PETERSON enters the bathroom.)

PETERSON: Sure it could have been switched manually. But whoever did it would have had to override the COS.

MULDR: What's the COS?

PETERSON: The central operating system. It runs the building. It regulates everything from energy output to the volume of water in each toilet flush.

JERRY: This is Claude Peterson. He's the building systems engineer. He discovered the body.

MULDER: If somebody wanted to override the COS, what would they ...?

PETERSON: Well, first he'd have to break the access codes which, well let's just say it wouldn't be easy.

(Camera watches them)

MULDER: Well, we're going to need a list of all the people with that kind of know how.

PETERSON: Well, I can tell you right now it'll be a pretty short list.

MULDER: Would you be on it?

PETERSON: Me? Hey, look. I'm just a glorified building super. All I do is monitor the system. Make sure it's functioning properly. Like when I saw the overload in Mr. Drake's office.

MULDER: What about the phone lines? Does the COS monitor all phone calls?

PETERSON: Yes it does. Why?

MULDER: I was just wondering.

PETERSON: Okay, um, look. Can I go now?

JERRY: Yeah. (Camera watches PETERSON leave. To MULDER) Why'd you ask him about the phones?

MULDER: Phone's off the hook. (hangs it up) Maybe Drake was talking to someone right before he did his Ben Franklin impersonation.

JERRY: (to SCULLY) Taught him everything he knows. (he exits)

(MULDER nods and smiles tightly at SCULLY who looks a bit over it.)




SCENE 6
FBI HEADQURTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.
(X-Files office. MULDER is looking around on his messy desk. Knock at door.)

MULDER: Come in.

SCULLY: (entering) It's past three.

MULDER: I'm just looking for my profile notes.

SCULLY: Maybe if you cleaned your desk more than once a year.

MULDER: They were right here. I'm telling you.

SCULLY: Come on. We're late.

(MULDER looks around one more time. SCULLY hands him his jacket and they exit.)




SCENE 7
CONFERENCE ROOM
(Investigative team meeting. MULDER stares at the wall as JERRY reads notes)

JERRY: Now, there are a couple of elements for us to consider, here. Both the statistical rarity of homicidal electrocution and the complexity of the crime indicate a certain devious premeditation. After all, there are much simpler ways of killing someone. All of which leads me to believe that our guy was some kind of sociopathic game player - - maybe even a recluse since he designed a trap not only to avoid detection, but to avoid contact with the victim.

SCULLY: (whisper to MULDER) Is that your profile?

MULDER: (whisper) Forget it, no.

JERRY: Drake's final phone call supports this theory. (plays tape)

COMPUTER VOICE: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 P.M.

JERRY: Drake's estimated time of death.

AGENT SPILLER: Why would Drake call for the correct time just before he died?

JERRY: It was an incoming call. From somewhere in the Eurisko building itself. Whoever set the trap wanted to make sure that Drake took the bait.

AGENT SPILLER: Excellent work, Agent Lamana.

JERRY: Thank you.

(MULDER looks not happy)




SCENE 8
FBI BUILDING
(MULDER approaches JERRY in the FBI bullpen)

MULDER: Jerry, what the hell are you doing?

JERRY: Hey, don't get all bent out of shape.

MULDER: Jerry, that was my profile.

JERRY: Look, I didn't think you'd mind. (Starts to leave, MULDER stops him) Anyway, they were just notes. I filled in the blanks.

MULDER: Jerry, you went into my office and you stole my work.

JERRY: Look, you're on this case ‘cause I asked you to help me out, and you helped me out. What is the big deal. (exits as SCULLY enters)

SCULLY: What did he say?

MULDER: He apologized - in his own way.

SCULLY: I just got off the phone with Peterson, the systems engineer. (hands MULDER a piece of paper)

MULDER: One name? Brad Wilczek?

SCULLY: He said it would be a short list. And it's headline news how much this guy despised Drake.

MULDER: That just seems too obvious. To kill Drake would be so brazenly egomaniacal.

SCULLY: And fully consistent with Jerry's excellent behavioral profile.

MULDER: Fully. (as they exit)




SCENE 9
WILCZEK'S COUNTRY CLUB HOUSE
(MULDER and SCULLY drive up. As they walk to the front door, a camera follows them)

MULDER: So this is what a 220 IQ and a $400 million severance settlement buys you.

(SCULLY knocks. WILCZEK opens door immediately)

WILCZEK: Yes?

SCULLY: (surprised) Brad Wilczek? (MULDER shows badge) We're with the FBI.

WILCZEK: What took you guys so long. Oh, do you mind taking off your shoes?

(WILCZEK leads MULDER and Short!SCULLY barefoot through the house)

WILCZEK: You can divide the computer science industry into two types of people - - neat and scruffy.

SCULLY: I take it Benjamin Drake fit into the first category.

WILCZEK: Neat people like things neat. They wear nicely pressed suits and work on surface phenomena. Things they can understand. Market shares, and third quarter profits.

SCULLY: And you had a different vision for the company?

WILCZEK: I started Eurisko out of my parents' garage. I was 22 years old. I'd just spent a year following around the Grateful Dead. You know what Eurisko means?

MULDER: That's from the Greek, isn't it? Um, "I learn things."

WILCZEK: Not exactly. It means "I discover things." (MULDER shrugs) Unfortunately, Ben Drake wasn't interested in discovery. He was a short-sighted, power-hungry opportunist. (Goes to computer) Let me show you something - Smart Home. From this prototype, I have access to every square foot of my house. This place is as safe as Fort Knox and as energy efficient as your average igloo. We were two years ahead of Microsoft and Cebus when Drake, in his infinite wisdom, killed the program.

MULDER: Mr. Wilczek, is this system related to the one in your corporate building?

WILCZEK: Variation on a theme.

MULDER: In your opinion, how many people know the system well enough to override it?

WILCZEK: Finally the bonus question. Not many is the answer.

MULDER: Could someone have hacked into the system?

WILCZEK: Well, not your average phone freak, that's for sure. But there's plenty of kooks out there. Data travelers, Electro wizards, techno anarchists. Anything's possible.

SCULLY: Could you have done it?

WILCZEK: Of course. I designed the system. That's why you guys are here, isn't it? I'm your logical suspect.

SCULLY: You don't seem too worried.

WILCZEK: It's a puzzle, Miss Scully, and scruffy minds like me like puzzles. We enjoy walking down unpredictable avenues of thought, turning new corners - - but as a general rule, scruffy minds don't commit murder.

(MULDER and SCULLY share a look under ominous music)




SCENE 10
SCULLY'S APARTMENT
(SCULLY working at computer)

SCULLY VOICE OVER: Some see genius as the ability to connect the unconnected -- to make juxtapositions, to see relationships where others cannot. Is Brad Wilczek a genius? I don't know. But I do know this for certain. He has a predilection for elaborate game playing. He has an intimate knowledge of the Eurisko building and he has a demonstrable motive for killing Benjamin Drake. The question remains. But if he is so clever how do we nail him? End of field journal, October 24, 1993.

(SCULLY turns off monitor, turns off light, goes into bedroom removing earrings, jacket and shoes. Computer beeps, monitor turns back on (?!) modem connects. SCULLY'S report comes up along with message "COS SCANNING: Scully, Dana --- Data Intercept." Camera shows that screen is now that of the COS inside the Eurisko building that we saw in the teaser.)

COS COMPUTER: File opened.




SCENE 11
X-FILES OFFICE
(MULDER and SCULLY listening to tapes of WILCZEK. SCULLY isolates the word "eastern." JERRY enters.)

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Will you give me a second? (SCULLY nods. MULDER steps outside the office with JERRY.)

JERRY: Look, I'm here with my hat in my hand. I screwed up - - I'm sorry. (Grins) What more can I say?

MULDER: All you had to do was ask. I would've helped you with the profile.

JERRY: You don't know what it's like, Mulder.

MULDER: What *what's* like?

JERRY: You heard about Atlanta?

MULDER: Yea ...

JERRY: They got me on six month's probation. I got to file daily reports like some cherry new agent.

MULDER: That was bad luck. That could have happened to anybody.

JERRY: Not to you.

MULDER: Don't run yourself down, Jerry. You're a good agent. We did some good work together.

JERRY: Let's face it. I was tagging along.

MULDER: That's not how it was.

JERRY: How would you know, Mulder? You were too busy dazzling them up there on the high wire.

SCULLY: (from the office) Mulder, take a look. (MULDER nods for JERRY to follow, then goes to SCULLY) We borrowed this from the voice biometrics lab at Georgetown. (Indicates voice analyzer.) It's a computer spectrogram capable of identifying individual speech patterns. Now this is the recording the Central Operating System made of the phone call Drake received just before he died.

RECORDING: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.

SCULLY: And this we spliced together from a series of lectures Brad Wilczek gave at the Smithsonian last year.

RECORDING 2: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.

SCULLY: Now we'll stack them. (plays them together)

JERRY: Your saying this is the same person?

MULDER: I'm saying that both voices are Brad Wilczek's. He may have disguised his voice electronically, but he couldn't alter the form that is unique to his own speech patterns.

SCULLY: Which means that he was the one that killed Drake. He had the motive and the means. And now we have the physical evidence. (Draws circles on the computer screen with a *hopefully* dry erase marker.) Judge Benson lives in Washington Heights. I can get a warrant in less than an hour.

JERRY: Someone has to make sure Wilczek stays put.

MULDER: I'll go with you.

JERRY: No. Let me bring him in alone. I need this one, Mulder.

MULDER: All right.

(JERRY leaves, smiling)




SCENE 12
WILCZEK'S HOUSE
(WILCZEK typing at computer.)

WILCZEK: Come on, come on. Let me in. (Screen says "Access Denied.") Damn!

(WILCZEK leaves his house and drives off in his early 60's ? Corvette. On the street, JERRY starts his car and follows.)




SCENE 13
EURISKO BUILDING
(WILCZEK runs in past security cameras to elevators.)

GUARD: Mr. Wilczek!

(In elevator camera watches WILCZEK)

ELEVATOR: Going up. Second floor...Third floor...Fourth floor...

(JERRY enters building and shows badge to GUARD.)

GUARD: Can I help you?

JERRY: FBI

(WILCZEK enters control room and begins typing. Screen prints "System access granted.")

COMPUTER: Welcome back, Brad.

WILCZEK: (speaking as he types) You're not equipped with a voice synthesizer. What is my user level?

COMPUTER: That is now at the discretion of the Operating System.

(JERRY enters elevator.)

ELEVATOR: `Going up. (Counts up floors. At 16th floor WILCZEK notices.)

WILCZEK: What are you doing?

COMPUTER: Sorry. Those commands are not available at your current user level. Try again.

(24th floor. JERRY checks his gun.)

WILCZEK: What are you doing!

COMPUTER: What are you doing! (echo)

(WILCZEK tries to manually shut down system. Elevator sticks between 29 and 30, repeating the numbers very quickly, then stops. Doors open to solid wall.)

JERRY: Oh, man.

(Elevator camera focuses on JERRY.)

ELEVATOR: Going down.

(As elevator goes into free fall, JERRY falls to floor.)

WILCZEK: NO!! Don't do this!

(Elevator crashes to bottom. Screen goes blank. WILCZEK horrified.)

COMPUTER: Program executed.




SCENE 14
X-FILES OFFICE
(MULDER watching video of JERRY falling with the elevator and of WILCZEK watching. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: I heard about Jerry. I'm sorry.

MULDER: I don't think Wilczek did it.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: It doesn't make sense. Why would he go back to Eurisko?

SCULLY: To destroy evidence. To cover his tracks.

MULDER: If you were going to destroy evidence, would you pose for the cameras?

(Show SCULLY tape of WILCZEK. SCULLY turns off tape and kneels beside MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you've been through a lot - - more than I think even you realize.

MULDER: I think Wilczek is smarter than this. (Turns on tape again.)

SCULLY: (after deep breath) He just signed a confession. How much proof do you need?




SCENE 15
WILCZEK'S HOUSE
(MULDER drives up to Wilczek's house. Several men in suits are in driveway.)

SUIT #1: Excuse me sir, this is a crime scene. You're going to have to leave.

MULDER: Yeah, I know. (Shows badge) I ordered the subpoena.

SUIT #1: That subpoena's been obviated.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SUIT #1: Unless you've got a code five clearance, I'm going to have to ask you to turn back.

(MULDER, obviously NOT having a code five clearance, gets back in his car and leaves.)




SCENE 16
PARK BENCH
(MULDER on park bench. DEEP THROAT arrives and MULDER rises to walk with him.)

MULDER: Thanks for coming.

DEEP THROAT: I'm here against my better judgement. In the future I must insist that you respect the terms of our arrangement.

MULDER: I need to know why Brad Wilczek is the subject of a code five investigation. What the Defense Department wants with him.

DEEP THROAT: What do you think they'd want with the most innovative programmer in this hemisphere?

MULDER: Software.

DEEP THROAT: For years, Wilczek has thumbed his nose at any contract involving weapons applications. He's a bleeding heart.

MULDER: What kind of software?

DEEP THROAT: How much do you know about artificial intelligence?

MULDER: I thought it was only theoretical.

DEEP THROAT: It was, until two years ago. You remember Helsinki, the first time that a chess playing computer ever beat a Grand Master? (MULDER nods.) That was Wilczek's program. And the rumor was that he did it by developing the first adaptive network.

MULDER: An adaptive network?

DEEP THROAT: It's a learning machine. A computer that actually thinks. And it's, ah, become something of a holy grail for some of our more acquisitive colleagues in the Department of Defense.




SCENE 17
FEDERAL DETENTION CENTER
WASHINGTON, D.C.
WILCZEK: They make me wear shoes all the time. What else do you want from me?

MULDER: I want you to tell me why you're willing to spend the rest of your life in prison for a crime you didn't commit.

WILCZEK: What are you talking about? I'm guilty.

MULDER: I know you're innocent. You're protecting a machine -- the Central Operating System at Eurisko.

WILCZEK: If I'm protecting anything, it's not the machine.

MULDER: Then what?

WILCZEK: After the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki - - Robert Oppenheimer spent the rest of his life regretting he'd ever glimpsed an atom.

MULDER: Oppenheimer may have regretted his actions but he never denied responsibility for them.

WILCZEK: He loved the work, Mr. Mulder. His mistake was in sharing it with an immoral government. I won't make the same mistake.

MULDER: But your machine killed Drake. And it killed my friend.

WILCZEK: I'm sorry about what happened. But there's nothing I can do.

MULDER: And you talk about morality. You're afraid of the government but you're willing to accept the risk that your machine will kill again.

WILCZEK: The lesser of two evils.

MULDER: What about a third option. You created that machine. Now you tell me how to destroy it.




SCENE 18
OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING
(MULDER and SCULLY walking outside the FBI building.)

MULDER: Wilczek can create a virus that will destroy the system.

SCULLY: Mulder, don't you see, blaming the machine is an alibi, and a bad one.

MULDER: But it's the only thing that makes sense. The COS project was posting big losses for Eurisko and Drake was about to terminate the program.

SCULLY: So the machine killed Drake out of self-defense?

MULDER: Self-preservation. It's the primary instinct of all sentient beings.

SCULLY: Mulder, that level of artificial intelligence is decades away from being realized.

MULDER: Then why was our government trying to usurp Wilczek's research?

SCULLY: (pulling him aside) Mulder, I think you're looking for something that isn't there. And I think it has something to do with Jerry. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea if you talked to someone.

MULDER: You're probably right. (Starts to leave.)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To talk to someone. (SCULLY watches him leave)




SCENE 19
FEDERAL DETENTION CENTER
(Guard opens door to WILCZEK's cell. MULDER enters, opens early 90's laptop, LOL)

MULDER: How much time do you need?




SCENE 20
SCULLY'S BEDROOM
SCULLY ASLEEP. CLOCK 1:31. Phone rings. SCULLY picks it up)

SCULLY: Hello?

(Modem sounds are heard over the phone. SCULLY hangs up and runs to her computer which is displaying her files.)

SCULLY: Oh my God. (Dials out on another line.) This is Special Agent Dana Scully, ID number 2317-616. I need you to run a quick trace on a number for me. Yeah, 202-555-6431. Yeah, that's my number. Somebody's accessing my computer.




SCENE 21
OUTSIDE EURISKO BUILDING
NIGHT
(MULDER opens his trunk, then turns to see SCULLY pulling up. License 3Y7-260)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing here?

SCULLY: Someone or something's been scanning my computer files. Tapping my phones. I traced the line. It came from somewhere in there.

MULDER: It's the machine.

SCULLY: How can we get in?

MULDER: You remember the Trojan Horse? (Reaches in trunk and pulls out VA license plate EURISKO)

(MULDER and SCULLY in car at metal gate entrance to parking deck. Computer scans the EURISKO plate. Green light PASS, and gate slides up.)

MULDER: (grinning) Open, Sesame! (SCULLY is not amused.)

(Computer watches them drive forward. When they are directly under the gate, a red and white bar stops them.)

MULDER: Oh, what the - -

(They look up and see the gate with evil little spikes crashing down on top of the car.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Horn is blaring as MULDER and SCULLY crawl out the drivers side of the smashed car. Mechanic!Mulder opens the hood and pulls the plug on the horn.)

MULDER: So much for the element of surprise. What do you say we take the stairs? (Computer watches them cross the garage.)




SCENE 22
STAIRWELL
(MULDER and SCULLY in stairwell, SCULLY still in her heels - better woman than I)

MULDER: 28 down, one to go. (Lights go out)

SCULLY: Oh, great. Mulder?

(Long pause. MULDER shines flashlight at SCULLY.)

MULDER: Trick or treat.

(SCULLY sighs. Flashlight illuminates #29. Computer watches. SCULLY reaches for doorknob.)

MULDER: No! (stops her)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I don't want to make the same mistake Drake made. (Takes insulated screwdriver out of his bag. When he touches it to the lock, WHAMMMMO!!!! Huge flash, lots of sparks. SCULLY jumps back. Beeping sound starts. MULDER tries door. Still locked. He looks around and points at security camera.)

MULDER: (to camera) What are you looking at? (Camera POV as MULDER puts glove over the lens. MULDER takes flashlight and looks around, then up at a ceiling vent. Then looks down at SCULLY.)

(SCULLY, shoeless now, is boosted by MULDER into the vent.)

SCULLY: Unh....

MULDER: There should be a way for you to drop down and open the door.

(SCULLY crawls into air duct tunnel and goes left.)

MULDER: (waiting, to himself) Come on, Scully.

(SCULLY crawling around. Air begins to blow)

(Door beeps and buzzes.)

MULDER: Scully? (Door opens)

PETERSON: Agent Mulder? What are you doing here?

(SCULLY in increasingly windy duct. Has trouble crawling. Debris flying. She is blown backwards. Wheeeee!)

SCULLY: Ahhhhh!!!!!

(She grabs a corner, but slips. Is about to slide into a large spinning fan, but catches another corner. Accidentally drops flashlight which falls into fan knocking off a fan blade.)

(MULDER and PETERSON enter the COS control room.)

PETERSON: The machine's been acting all crazy. Power surges, shut off. That's why I'm here so late.

MULDER: Where's the B port?

PETERSON: Oh, it's right back here. (Opens console. MULDER gets tool out of his bag.) Look, are you sure you know what you're doing? Because if you don't, it's my job on the line.

(MULDER attaches electronic device to console. Screen reads Access Denied.)

MULDER: Damn.

(SCULLY in wind tunnel pulls out her gun and begins shooting at the fan. Two more blades down.)

(MULDER tries again. Screen reads Begin Algorithm Code Program.)

COMPUTER: System access granted. (MULDER claps his hands together and runs to keyboard.) User code level seven.

MULDER: Now I can put in the virus.

PETERSON: (aims a gun at MULDER) Not bad, Agent Mulder. You know, I've been trying to access the CPU for the past two years. Now please, take out your gun and remove the clip. (MULDER sighs, and obeys.) Careful.

MULDER: Defense Department?

PETERSON: Lets just say our paychecks are signed by the same person. Now give me the diskette and step away from the console. (MULDER doesn't move.) You don't want to test my resolve, Agent Mulder. (Mulder hands him diskette.)

(Very windblown SCULLY opens the door, pointing gun at PETERSON.)

SCULLY: (don't mess with me attitude) Put down the gun.

PETERSON: Look, you may think you know what you're dealing with -

SCULLY: Shut up and drop the gun.

PETERSON: (Setting down the gun) You're making a mistake, Agent Scully. Compromising your sworn duty. This operation is more sensitive than you can possibly imagine.

MULDER: Don't listen to him.

PETERSON: The technology in this machine is of enormous scientific interest.

MULDER: The machine's a monster, Scully. It's already killed two people. They won't be able to handle it any better than Wilczek did.

PETERSON: Make no mistake ..... *You* will be held accountable.

SCULLY: (after a pause) Mulder, put in the disc.

(MULDER puts in disc. Doesn't have to push enter or anything. Hmmm.)

COMPUTER: What are you doing, Brad? Don't do this, Brad. (Gibberish. Screen fills with gibberish also. Elevator doors open and close, cameras swing back and forth.) Brad....Brad....Why?

(MULDER and SCULLY look relieved. Light all come back on in building.)




SCENE 23
PARK
(Outside day on bench with Deep Throat)

MULDER: I checked with Congressman Klebanon and the Department of Corrections Subcommittee. I even petitioned the Attorney General's office.

DEEP THROAT: You won't find him.

MULDER: They can't just take a man like Brad Wilczek without an explanation.

DEEP THROAT: *They* can do anything they want.

MULDER: Where is he?

DEEP THROAT: In the middle of what we in the trade call "hard bargaining."

MULDER: Wilczek won't deal. He'll never work for them.

DEEP THROAT: Loss of freedom does funny things to a man, and remember, Wilczek confessed to two murders, and you effectively destroyed the only evidence that could have exonerated him.

MULDER: What else could I have done?

DEEP THROAT: Nothing... Unless you were willing to let the technology survive.

MULDER: The Department of Defense still hasn't found anything?

DEEP THROAT: They've been on it for five days. Wilczek's virus was thorough. It left no trace of the artificial intelligence. The machine is dead. (DT rises and leaves)




SCENE 24
DOD LAB
PETERSON: (on phone) We've pushed the pulse code modulations to the limit. Nothing. (Techies carrying around pieces of computer) We've combed the parsing subroutine. Yes, sir. Twice. No, sir. Still nothing. But I'd like to request .... Yes, sir. No, I understand. Yes, sir. (hangs up) Well, six more hours before we have to consign the whole damn thing to the metal shredder.

TECH: We'll do what we can, sir.

(Behind PETERSON, light comes on, camera looks at PETERSON)

PETERSON: (Camera POV) I'm going to figure this thing out if it kills me.

[THE END]


SCENE 1
ARCTIC ICE CORE PROJECT; ICY CAPE, ALASKA;
250 MILES NORTH OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
(A large installation is ravaged by a harsh snowstorm. The temperature is forty below, and the time is 8:29. A dog pulls his head out of a barrel, whimpers and starts walking. As he walks, we see the room is a mess and there is a dead man on the floor. He continues whimpering and turns a corner, walking under a hand of another dead man. A rugged looking man, John Richter, knocks over a box, gun in hand, shot in the leg. He has two wounds across his chest, one on each pec, and they are bleeding heavily. His breathing is heavy as he stops and looks around. Richter walks over to a console and flips a few switches, turning machines on. He turns on a video camera and a light and sits down.)

RICHTER: We're not... who... we are. We're not... who we are. It goes no further than this. It stops right here... right now.

(Suddenly, a man comes up from behind up, puts his arm around Richter's neck and pulls him off his chair. The two men grunt as Richter slams the man into the wall behind him. The man is obviously insane, his eyes gleaming as he rams Richter into a sheet of metal on the far wall. Richter spins around and knocks him into a cabinet. He grabs the man's wrist and slams it twice into the upper corner of the cabinet, forcing him to release the gun he was holding. He pushes his face away but the man punches him in the gut. Richter grabs him by the throat, slams him into the cabinet, then shoves him through a glass pane. Richter punches him, stands up, limps back towards the console and takes his gun off of the counter. He aims it at the man, who walks back in, gun aimed directly at Richter. They walk towards each other until the nozzles are only about an inch or two away from the other's face. There is a pause as they measure each other up. Richter slowly lowers his gun. The insane man, perplexed, does the same. Richter slowly brings the gun up to his own head. The insane man follows course. Outside the bunker, we hear two shots ring out.)




SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(On a TV, static comes up followed by a short screen patch. A video comes on of five men around a beer keg. A few of them are holding beers. One of the men is Richter; another is the insane man.)

RICHTER: Team Captain John Richter here. It's been a couple of frustrating months but after a great deal of stick-with-it-ness, we're very proud to report that as of a half-hour ago, we surpassed the previous record for drilling down into an ice sheet.

MAN: All right!

(The man high five and shake hands. The tape is paused. We zoom out to see that Mulder is showing Scully the tape. He is sitting in front of the monitor as she is standing behind his desk, looking at a file.)

MULDER: This team of scientists made up the Arctic Ice Core Project. They were sent to Alaska by the government's Advanced Research Project Agency nearly a year ago to drill into the arctic ice.

(He stands and tears a paper from a printer as she sits down.)

The samples they removed contained trapped gases, dust, chemicals... evidence that could reveal the structure of the earth's climate back to the dawn of man. Their work was a success, nearly completed. No reports or indications of problems of any kind until only a week later, this next
transmission was received.

(He presses a button on the remote control. On the monitor, a blue screen comes up with the following:

" AICP
Arctic
Ice Core
Project
Transmission received:
November 5, 1993
8:30 AM AST"

Richter is sitting at the chair, as before. We are looking from the camera's POV and he is much closer. We can only see the left side of his face.)

RICHTER: We're not... who... we are. We're not... who we are. It goes no further than this. It stops... right here... right now.

(Scully watches, wide-eyed. The man rushes and pulls him off as the transmission breaks into static.)

SCULLY: What happened up there?

(He presses another button on the remote and kneels down next to her.)

MULDER: So far nobody's been able to reach to reach the compound because of bad weather. Obviously, they either think we're either brilliant or expendable because we've pulled the assignment.

SCULLY: Is it severe isolation distress?

MULDER: These were top geophysicists. They were trained and screened for this project in every way imaginable, including psychological makeup. We leave for Nome today.

(He stands and goes to a map. She follows. He traces his finger from Nome to the Icy Cape.)

We'll meet with three scientists familiar with the ice core project then head north up to the Icy Cape. The National Weather Service reports a three-day window to get in and out before the next arctic storm. Bring your mittens.

(He walks out behind her.)




SCENE 3
DOOLITTLE AIRFIELD; NOME, ALASKA
(Men load a plane full of cargo as a man, Prof. Danny Murphy, sits and listens to his walkman in the back near the hangar door, sitting on a crate.)

RADIO ANNOUNCER: Fouts looks over the Raiders' defense... here's the snap. Raiders blitz! Fouts dumps it across the middle to Winslow! He's at the 15! The 10! Touchdown San Diego!

(The man stands and laughs giddily.)

MURPHY: Touchdown! Fouts... is... God!

(He spins around and stops, having noticed Mulder and Scully walking towards him. He pulls out the earphones and turns back to them.)

Sorry. My team scored.

SCULLY: There's no football on Wednesday.

(Mulder puts down his bag.)

MULDER: Fouts retired in '87, didn't he?

MURPHY: No, this is just some of my all-time favorite plays on tape. You two F.B.I.?

MULDER: Agent Mulder and Agent Scully, you?

(Mulder points to himself, then to Scully, then shakes the man's hand.)

MURPHY: Danny Murphy, professor of geology at U. C. San Diego.

MULDER: San Diego? You get much of a chance to study ice down there?

MURPHY: Just what's around the keg.

(Mulder laughs. A man, Hodge, and a woman, DaSilva, walk towards them. The man is pushing some equipment on a roller.)

SCULLY: Dr. DaSilva, Dr. Hodge?

HODGE: Yeah, sorry we're late.

(Hodge shakes hands with Mulder, then Scully, then Murphy. DaSilva does the same.)

SCULLY: Hi, Agent Mulder, Agent Scully...

MULDER: Mulder, nice to meet you.

HODGE: How're you doing, Mister Mulder?

MULDER: Hi.

HODGE: Can I see some identification?

MULDER: What for?

HODGE: I just want to make sure we are who we say we are.

(They all take out their ID. Hodge shows his to Murphy, DaSilva shows hers to the agents.)

That's me.

MURPHY: That's you. (showing ID to him) It's me.

HODGE: It's you.

MULDER: (Showing it to Hodge) It's me!

HODGE: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

MULDER: (looking at DaSilva's ID) It's you.

HODGE: Well, now that we know who we are, anybody care to take a guess as to why we're going?

MURPHY: Well, two federal agents, a geologist, a medical doctor and a toxicologist. That should give us some idea what they're thinking.

SCULLY: I assume you all took a look at the tape.

(DaSilva and Hodge look at each other.)

MULDER: Something wrong?

DASILVA: Come on, you're F.B.I. You have to know more than we do.

(Loud music blares from a jeep that pulls up. A man named Bear gets out of the car and goes around to the back.)

BEAR: You folks the ones going up to Icy Cape?

MULDER: Yeah.

BEAR: Then I'm the one flying you. My name's Bear. The plane's across the way, provisions are loaded. Grab your gear.

(He takes a bag out and starts walking.)

HODGE: Oh, could we see some credentials?

(Bear stops, laughs and walks back over to Hodge.)

BEAR: Credentials. The only credentials that I have is that I'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there. You don't like those credentials... walk.

(Bear continues walking. Murphy and Mulder laugh to themselves as they collect their gear. We see the plane flying past mountains.)




SCENE 4
ARCTIC ICE CORE PROJECT; ICY CAPE, ALASKA
(Mulder prys open the door and the rest follow in, all carrying flashlights and wearing parkas. They look down to see Richter and the insane man lying on the ground, dead, guns near them.)

MULDER: Bear? See if you can get the power started.

BEAR: Anything to get out of here.

(He walks towards the back.)

SCULLY: Where do we start?

HODGE: Body bags are on the plane.

MULDER: Before we touch anything, we have to thoroughly document the scene.

(They start off towards the back. Scully takes out her camera.)

SCULLY: Flashing.

(She takes a picture. Mulder opens up a cabinet that says "Ice Cores 3,175 - 3,260. Inside there are piles of ice inside containers. The ice is melting. Murphy walks up behind him.)

MULDER: That's what they were drilling for. Quarter of a million years melting away in a couple of days.

MURPHY: I want to preserve some samples.

(He reaches in and takes a container. We hear the camera going off in the bathroom. DaSilva opens up a door and is startled to hear a bang and some rumbling. Mulder walks up to her.)

MULDER: It's the generator.

DASILVA: Oh.

(They walk in. The lights turn on and a growling is heard. DaSilva turns around and sees the dog.)

Agent Mulder! Look out!

(The dog jumps on Mulder, attacking him. Bear, Murphy and Hodge all run in. Mulder struggles to his feet but is knocked down again. Bear runs over and grabs the dog as Scully runs in.)

BEAR: Hold on.

(The dog knocks Bear down and bites his hand, breaking the skin. Mulder takes a coat and wraps it around the dog's head as Hodge gets a needle.)

HODGE: Hold it down!

(Hodge runs over and injects the dog with the needle. The dog whimpers as Bear applies pressure to the wound. Murphy, Mulder and DaSilva put the dog up on the table.)

SCULLY: You okay?

MULDER: Yeah, he didn't break the skin. Bear, you okay?

BEAR: He got me.

HODGE: Take that jacket off.

BEAR: Just give me the stuff, I'll do it myself.

DASILVA: Is it rabies?

(Hodge goes over to the dog. Scully looks at the dog's paw.)

HODGE: I don't see any indication of glodal spasm or tetany. If it is rabies, it's certainly not a strain I'm familiar with.

(He lifts the paw up to reveal black spots on the sweat nodes.)

SCULLY: Look at this. Black nodules. Swollen lymph nodes.

DASILVA: Symptoms of the bubonic plague.

HODGE: I'll do a blood test, we'll take it from that.

(Hodge walks away. Scully moves away some hair to reveal a place on the skin that had been irritated, hair torn off.)

SCULLY: This dog has got a skin irritation on it's neck.

MURPHY: It looks like it's been scratching off it's own hair.

(A bump moves down across the part under the skin.)

SCULLY: Look at this, look at this!

(Hodge runs over to look. The bump recedes back away from view.)

MURPHY: What the hell was that?

(They all look at each other. In the bathroom, Bear finishes taping up the wound. He keels over in pain, holding his stomach and sits down on the toilet. He takes off his shirt and looks in the mirror. Under his arm are the same black nodules as the dog had. Scully stands up, writing on her notes. She walks towards Mulder.)

SCULLY: From the autopsies, it's clear that these men killed each other. There are contusions around the throat areas of three men, evidence of strangulation.

(Mulder nods. Bear starts listening.)

Richter and Campbell killed themselves. I also found tissue damage due to fever.

BEAR: Did any of them have the black spots that the dog had?

SCULLY: No. None of them had the black nodules.

BEAR: So, uh, those spots didn't have anything to do with those guys killing each other, right?

(Hodge walks in.)

HODGE: I wouldn't rule it out. I just reexamined the dog. The nodules are gone.

MULDER: What could that mean?

HODGE: Well, it could mean that the spots are a symptom of some disease at an early stage.

(Hodge, Mulder and Scully walk over to the lab. Bear starts dragging the bodies, now in bodybags, out. DaSilva walks over to the counter and picks up one of the guns, which is in an evidence bag. She moves it on top of a few other bags and picks up a clipboard. Mulder picks up a few clipboards around another table until he finds a folder. Written on the folder is "We are not who we are" three times, and then it is written twice in big letters.)

MULDER: Danny?

(He walks over to Murphy, who is looking at a paper, pen in mouth and listening to his tape player.)

Danny.

(He waves his hand in front of Murphy's face, who is startled. He takes out his earphones.)

MURPHY: Sorry. The play-off game against Miami, '82. Helps to get my mind off stuff.

MULDER: My interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos is a little rusty.

(He shows Murphy an overhead picture of a vast arctic landscape.)

MURPHY: Alright, this is the Icy Cape area. It approximates the depth of the ice sheet to be about 3,000 meters thick.

(Mulder shows him another folder.)

MULDER: I also found this data and if I'm reading it correctly, the team actually found the ice sheet to be twice that depth.

MURPHY: That's very good. The numbers indicate the topography to be concave. Looks like they were drilling inside a meteor crater.

(Hodge and Scully are sitting at a desk, microscope in front of them.)

HODGE: No, you're wrong. That's impossible.

SCULLY: I analyzed two samples.

(Mulder walks over.)

MULDER: What'd you find?

SCULLY: There seems to be a presence of ammonium hydroxide in Richter's blood sample.

(DaSilva walks in and over.)

HODGE: It's not possible. Ammonia would vaporize at human body temperature.

DASILVA: I checked all the air filtration systems. I found no evidence of any such toxins.

(Murphy stands.)

MURPHY: I have.

(They all look back at him.)

In the ice. And that's not all there is.

(He motions for Mulder to come back to his desk as he takes off his coat. Bear walks in and stands at the doorway.)

I found a high ratio of ammonia to water in the ice core. The earth's atmosphere could never have produced such high levels, not even a quarter of a million years ago. Look in the scope.

(Scully walks over as Mulder looks into the scope.)

MULDER: Unless a foreign object was introduced into that environment.

MURPHY: Tell me that's not a foreign object.

(A small, skeletal shaped worm moves around inside the sample.)

MULDER: Holy... Scully.

(He motions to Scully, who looks in the scope. Bear walks to the desk.)

SCULLY: That same thing is in Richter's blood.

(She walks over to her microscope.)

What if that single-celled organism is the larval stage of a larger animal?

(Hodge looks up from his microscope and walks over.)

HODGE: That's kind of a leap, don't you think?

(Mulder looks into the scope.)

SCULLY: The evidence is there.

MURPHY: Maybe the organism in the ice core somehow got into the men.

DASILVA: Come on, nothing can survive in sub-zero temperatures for a quarter of a million years.

MULDER: Unless that's how it lives.

(Bear walks over.)

BEAR: Look-it, I don't see why you're squabbling over some bug. You said it yourself, Scully, your autopsy found those men killed each other. That's it. Now I say, let's just get the hell out of here.

HODGE: I agree. We can have the bodies sent to a facility where they can make a definitive diagnosis in the event that something was missed, Agent Scully.

MULDER: If those bodies are infected with an unknown organism, we can't take them back. We can't go back without proper quarantine procedures. We can't risk bringing back the next plague.

BEAR: Let's say you're right, they came down with something. We haven't and I ain't waiting around until we do.

(Bear starts out, but turns back when he hears Hodge.)

HODGE: I think it's safe to go back. There's no reason why we'd be infected. We've taken all the necessary biological safeguards.

DASILVA: The dog did bite Bear.

BEAR: It jumped Mulder too!

(Bear comes back and tries to get in Mulder's face, but DaSilva gets between them.)

MULDER: It didn't break the skin -

SCULLY: Hey, look, there's only one way to proceed. A good doctor eliminates every possibility. We must determine if any of us is infected.

(There is an uncomfortable pause.)

HODGE: Alright, parasitic diagnostic procedure requires that each of us provide a blood and a stool sample.

BEAR: A stool sample?

MURPHY: Well, this kind of travel always makes that kind of tough... for me.

(Scully puts some jars down on the counter.)

MULDER: Okay, anyone got the morning sports section handy?

(Bear picks up a jar.)

BEAR: I ain't dropping my cargo for no one.

(He throws the jar into the far wall. It shatters and DaSilva lets out a little yelp.)

What I'm doing is getting my gear, getting my plane and flying the hell out of here.

(He starts out.)

MULDER: You can't go, the dog bit you.

(Bear turns around and gets in his face.)

BEAR: I got hired to fly you up here and fly you back. No one said this might be part of the deal. So the deal is over.

(Bear walks out.)

SCULLY: We can't let him leave without him being checked.

DASILVA: Who's going to stop him?

MULDER: We have to. We can't risk infecting the population.

DASILVA: He gets on that plane, I'm gonna be on it with him.

SCULLY: Well, we don't have time to argue about it.

MULDER: Take a vote. Whoever believes we should confine Bear until he agrees to an examination?

(Mulder, Scully and Murphy raise their hands.)

All right.

(Mulder takes out his gun as Bear walks in carrying two bags.)

Bear, we just want to check you out. If we don't find any trace of the parasite or the virus, we'll all go.

(They all look at Bear. He pauses, looks at Mulder's gun, and walks over to the desk.)

BEAR: All right, give me the damn jar.

(He picks up the jar. Mulder starts to put the gun away as Bear breaks the jar over his head. Mulder screams a bit. Bear starts to run but Scully tackles him. Mulder runs over to help hold him down as the rest watch.)

MULDER: Murphy, get a rope!

MURPHY: Right.

(Murphy goes off to get a rope. Bear grunts repeatedly and heavily as Mulder picks him up and slams his head down on the counter, shoving off the glasses and papers with his head. Murphy runs back and gives him the rope.)

Here!

(Mulder starts to tie him up as Bear starts spasming. DaSilva notices the little bump in his neck, moving around.)

DASILVA: Oh my God... oh!

HODGE: Get my bag!

SCULLY: What are you gonna do?

(Murphy holds Bear's head down as DaSilva comes back with the bag.)

HODGE: Scalpel, I'm cutting it out.

MULDER: We don't know enough about it!

HODGE: It's killing him!

(Bear starts spasming harder.)

Scully, help me hold the skin.

(Mulder looks closer as Scully puts on gloves and holds the skin apart. DaSilva places tools on the desk.)

Hold still, Bear!

(Bear screams as the scalpel goes in.)

Forceps!

(DaSilva hands him the forceps.)

Hold still, Bear, just another second. You're gonna be okay.

(Mulder looks on, disgusted, as Hodge starts to pull the worm out of his neck. Hodge pulls at the worm, which has attached itself to some muscle. Bear moans as the worm is ripped off. Mulder runs to the next counter. The worm starts spurting black drops on Bear's neck. DaSilva coughs as Mulder comes back with a jar, which Hodge puts the worm in. Mulder closes the lid and hands it to Murphy. He walks over to the radio and turns it on.)

MULDER: This is the A.I.C.P. Investigative Team calling Doolittle Airfield, come in.

RADIO: D.A.F. responding.

MULDER: This is Agent Mulder, we have a serious biological hazard. Request air pick-up and quarantine procedures, over.

(Static.)

Come in, Doolittle Airfield.

RADIO: We copy, Agent Mulder. This area is under a heavy storm and no aircraft can get out for the next day. Maybe the military base in Kotzebue can set up a quarantine. Advise immediate evacuation, the arctic storm is bearing in your direction, over.

MULDER: We were told we would have three clear days of weather, over.

RADIO: Welcome to the top of the world, Agent Mulder. Over.

(Mulder walks back over to them.)

MULDER: Is Bear in any condition to fly? We don't get out in an hour, we don't get out for days.

(Scully and Hodge look at each other. They are wiping the blood of their hands. Scully looks back at Mulder.)

SCULLY: He's dead.

(Mulder walks over to Bear, still slumped over the table. Blood is on the table as well as the jar with the worm inside it. Later, the jar is now filled with ammonia and the worm swims around inside.)

HODGE: Well, it's similar to a tapeworm in that it has a scolex with suckers and hooks.

MURPHY: So then it's familiar? Something you can deal with?

(The jar is inside a freezer. Hodge closes the freezer door as Murphy and DaSilva stand behind him.)

DASILVA: What?

HODGE: No. Very different from any organism, at least that I know of.

(Hodge walks over to Mulder, who's sitting at a desk.)

MULDER: Have you figured out how it's transmitted yet?

HODGE: Exchange of fluids, touch, air, all of the above? I don't know.

(Scully walks in holding another jar.)

SCULLY: All of the other dead bodies had the creature. This is the only one that's still alive.

(They all walk over to the counter.)

MULDER: Were they all in the spine?

SCULLY: No. It appears that they were in the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain.

(She sets the jar down and fills it with ammonia.)

MURPHY: Hypothalamus... what was that again?

SCULLY: It's a gland that secretes hormones although I don't know why a parasite would want to attach to it.

(She puts the jar into the freezer and takes off her coat. She walks over to the counter as Hodge starts walking to the freezer.)

HODGE: Hypothalamus releases acetlycholine, which produces violent, aggresive behavior. That might be a connection. Everybody that's been infected certainly seems to act aggresively. Maybe the worm feeds on the acetlycholine which floods our capacity to control violent behavior.

SCULLY: Well, a parasite shouldn't want to kill it's host.

HODGE: It doesn't kill you until it's extracted. Then it releases a poison.

MULDER: You're saying it's possible that the worm makes you want to kill other people, which is maybe what happened to the first team.

DASILVA: Or what could happen to us.

HODGE: Well, it's just a theory. We don't have any definite proof.

MURPHY: Except five dead men.

SCULLY: If the worm makes people violently aggresive then why did Richter and Campbell kill themselves?

MULDER: Maybe they did it to save us.

(Mulder walks off. There is an uncomfortable pause. As the storm ravages the base, Scully checks the bodys. She zips up the bodybag as Mulder walks in.)

SCULLY: I'm just, uh... double-checking. Making sure I didn't miss anything.

MULDER: Just some sleep, huh?

SCULLY: Sleep. I'm so tired I can't sleep.

MULDER: We're all wired and hypersensitive, it'll be good to get a fresh start in the morning.

SCULLY: Mulder, I don't want to waste a second trying to find a way to kill this thing.

(She starts out.)

MULDER: I don't know if we should kill it.

(She turns back, shocked.)

This area of the ice sheet was formed over a meteor crater. The worm lived in ammonia. It survived sub-zero temperatures. Theorists in alternative life-designs believe in ammonia-supported life systems on planets with freezing temperatures.

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: The meteor that crashed here a quarter of a million years ago may have carried that type of life to earth.

SCULLY: Mulder, that pilot developed surface symptoms within a few minutes. Within a few hours, that parasite had total control. What would happen if this got into the population? A city the size of New York could be infected within a few days.

MULDER: Exactly. But what do we know about it? This organism might be lying dormant in another crater.

SCULLY: Mulder, if we don't kill it now, we run the risk of becoming Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads.

MULDER: But if we do kill it now, we may never know how to stop it or anything like it in the future.

(In the laboratory, Murphy puts on his earphones and works. Hodge and DaSilva stand around listening to Scully and Mulder, who can be heard yelling mostly illegibly in the background.)

SCULLY: Future? Mulder, how can you talk about the future when right now, there's... (trails off illegibly) ...or anyone has the right to?

MULDER: Do we have the right to destroy an organism which can provide... (trails off)

DASILVA: Tell me it's hot in here.

HODGE: Don't worry, you don't have a fever. The heating system's malfunctioning. Outside, it's forty below and in here we're sweltering.

DASILVA: Can you hear what they're arguing about?

(Hodge sits down as DaSilva takes off her coat.)

HODGE: They're probably discussing their little government secrets.

DASILVA: You think they knew it was up here before we arrived?

HODGE: I'm sure of it.

SCULLY: ...about them posing a biological hazard!

HODGE: You know, Bear's infected blood did get on Scully.

DASILVA: It also got on you.

(They get up and walk towards the back. Mulder and Scully charge into another room.)

MULDER: How do you know it can't be contained?

SCULLY: It can! By extermination, we should take those bodies, worms and all, outside and incinerate them!

(Hodge, Murphy and DaSilva walk in.)

HODGE: Something going on we should know about? Agent Scully, you all right?

SCULLY: Yes, I'm fine. It's nothing.

HODGE: You seem a little bit stressed out.

(Scully nods until she understands what Hodge is insinuating.)

SCULLY: What the hell are you trying to say?

(She goes to get in Hodge's face when Mulder gets between them.)

MULDER: Let's all just settle down, it's been a long hard day. We're all tired and scared. Let's not all turn on one another.

HODGE: At least not without a good reason.

MULDER: Maybe we should all get some sleep.

HODGE: You kidding? You think any of us could sleep right now? Guys, let's face it, we've got to check for spots. Any person or persons who has them should be confined. Are we agreed on that?

DASILVA: Are you going to do the exams?

SCULLY: No. We do them in front of each other. No secrets.

(Mulder, Murphy and Hodge all start to undress in a room.)

MULDER: Before anyone passes judgement, may I remind you we are in the Arctic.

(Scully checks out DaSilva, who has her arms raised as Scully checks for spots. We can only see DaSilva's back, though it is apparent that she is naked. Scully lowers her arm, holds her hand and smiles. They both sigh in relief. All five start off to their rooms, carrying flashlights down the hall.)

HODGE: Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.

(He goes into his room.)

DASILVA: Yeah, good night.

(Murphy and DaSilva go into their rooms. All three doors slam shut at once.
Mulder and Scully enter the go to their doors.)

SCULLY: Good night, Mulder.

MULDER: Good night, Scully.

SCULLY: At least everyone's okay.

MULDER: Don't forget, the spots on the dog went away.

(Mulder closes his door. Scully goes into her room, turns on the light, and sets her bags and flashlight down on the bed. She goes over and turns on the wall lamp. She looks at a picture of the arctic team. She thinks for a moment, then moves the dresser in front of the door. She sits down next to it against the wall and curls up. Murphy listens to the radio, eyeing the door intently.)

RADIO ANNOUNCER: ...at the three yard line with fourth and goal and only fifteen seconds left in the game. Fouts goes over the ball, he snaps! He goes right...

(Hodge is making notes that say the following:

Mulder - attacked by dog

Scully - exposed to infected blood

Murphy - exposed to liquified ice core"

He eyes the door. DaSilva rolls over in bed, almost crying. Mulder puts his gun down on the dresser and looks at the door. Later, with the lights out, Mulder wakes with a startle. He immediately checks his gun. He looks for his shoes and hears a door close. He puts on his shoes and shirt, takes his gun and flashlight and sees that Murphy's door is open. Looking in, he sees no one. The walkman is on the bed. He goes into the lab, walking around. He is startled by the dog, which growls at him. He spins around, gun aimed, until he realizes it's the dog. He goes over to the desk, then looks at the freezer. Blood drips out under the door and onto the floor. He opens the door and Murphy falls out onto him, neck slit wide open and covered with blood. Scully, DaSilva and Hodge walk in.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing?

MULDER: Murphy's dead.

HODGE: You killed him.

MULDER: I found him like this. I heard one of the doors close, I came out to check it out. It's one of you.

HODGE: He's lying.

DASILVA: You could have done it and not even known.

SCULLY: No, he said he didn't do it.

MULDER: I don't have any of the symptoms.

SCULLY: You checked him yourself, Hodge.

HODGE: Yeah, six hours ago.

MULDER: It was one of you!

(Mulder starts towards Hodge but Scully gets between them.)

SCULLY: Stop it! Just stop it, shut up!

(Hodge and Mulder glare at each other.)

Mulder, just put the gun down and let Hodge give you a blood test.

MULDER: What, so he can doctor the results? I'm not gonna let him stick a needle in me! He could be infected!

HODGE: He has to be confined now!

SCULLY: Then just turn around and let us take a look at your neck!

MULDER: I'm not turning my back on anyone! As far as I'm concerned, you're all infected!

(Mulder walks back slowly, waving his gun around. Hodge inches over to the counter.)

DASILVA: Hodge is right, we oughta lock him up!

(Hodge grabs a crowbar and lurches a bit. Mulder points his gun at Hodge to stop him. Scully points her gun at Mulder.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Scully, get that gun off me!

SCULLY: Mulder, you have to understand!

(Mulder points his gun at Scully.)

MULDER: Put it down!

SCULLY: You put it down first!

MULDER: Scully! For God sakes, it's me!

SCULLY: Mulder... you may not be who you are.

(Mulder comes to his senses and lowers the gun. We see Mulder stepping into a dark storage room. He turns on the light as Scully stands in the doorway. He faces her.)

MULDER: In here, I'll be safer than you.

(Scully slides the door shut and bolts it. She leans against the door, thinking about what she has done. She starts off, looks back at the bolt, then walks off. Walking into the lab, she sees DaSilva asleep at the desk. Gun in hand, she walks over quietly and moves the back of her shirt down, trying to get a look at her neck. Hodge comes in and grabs her hand. DaSilva wakes up with a short scream.)

HODGE: What were you doing?

SCULLY: You know what I was doing.

HODGE: You know, I can't help thinking, Agent Scully, that you're the only one with a gun. If you get infected, we don't stand a chance, do we?

(Scully looks at them, takes out the clip, takes out her other gun, takes out that clip, and places the guns on the counter.

Okay.

(She goes to the main door and throws the clips away.)

DASILVA: Was there something there?

HODGE: You're okay, Nancy. We're all okay. Now is not the time for the three of us to break down and turn on each other.

SCULLY: There's four of us.

HODGE: Mulder isn't one of us anymore.

SCULLY: If Mulder is infected, it's not his fault! We can't turn our backs on him now, he needs us to help him!

DASILVA: She's right. Who knows what prolonged exposure to the parasite could do to him? It could damage him to the point of permanent psychosis.

(Scully starts off but Hodge grabs her arm.)

HODGE: But if he is infected, he doesn't go back! I won't risk the possibilities!

(She goes over to the radio and turns it on.)

SCULLY: This is A.I.C.P. calling Doolittle Airfield, please come in.

(Static.)

This is the Arctic Ice Core Project sending a general distress call, please respond!

(Static. Hodge and DaSilva looks through microscopes. Hodge is looking at the larvae.)

HODGE: Nanc, you wanna put a drop of the uninfected blood on the slide of the blood drawn from the pilot?

DASILVA: Run that by me again.

HODGE: Put the uninfected blood on the infected blood.

(She gets up and takes the slide over to a tube rack full of vials. Hodge looks over her shoulder. DaSilva puts another drop of blood on the slide. Hodge looks at it and smacks her on the butt with the clipboard. Scully walks in.)

No, damn it! What did I just get through telling you? You just infected already infected blood, now we have to start all over again.

DASILVA: I made a mistake, you don't have to yell at me.

HODGE: Wasted hours of work... (trails off)

(Hodge starts off, DaSilva follows.)

DASILVA: Well okay, well then maybe you could just do it by yourself! Damn it!
God, I'm not your assistant!

HODGE: Oh, get out of here...

DASILVA: All you do is just... (trails off)

(Scully looks through microscope and sees that the larvae are attacking each other viciously. Suddenly, they both go limp and die. Hodge walks back in.)

SCULLY: Hodge.

HODGE: What?

SCULLY: Come take a look at this. The larvae from two different worms killed each other.

(Hodge looks in the microscope. Scully goes over to the freezer and moves one of the jars from the bottom shelf right next to the other one. The worms try to get at each other through the glass. DaSilva and Hodge come over and look.)

An individual worm will not tolerate another invading it's host. It does to the invader what it did to humans. It makes them kill.

HODGE: It doesn't make sense for a species to kill it's own, it needs another to procreate.

DASILVA: Worms are hermaphroditic. It can reproduce itself.

SCULLY: Look at the evidence in the microscope. This thing does not like company.

HODGE: So what are you saying? The way to kill it is to introduce another worm into the already infected body?

(Scully nods. A short while later, Hodge injects a painkiller into the dog's ear to numb it. Scully, holding the worm with forceps, puts the worm down on the dog's ear. The worm crawls inside and the dog starts whimpering soon after. They put it back in it's cage. The dog's paws start shaking until the dog grows quieter. It lays down on it's belly and whimpers a bit more. Hodge opens the door and takes the dog's heartbeat with a stethescope.)

Sounds okay.

(Scully puts a bowl full of dog food on the ground and the dog comes over and starts eating. Scully pets it as DaSilva stands off to the side. Hodge comes in.)

It passed the worms in it's stool. They're dead.

(Scully unbolts the door to Mulder's makeshift cell. Hodge stands against the door.)

SCULLY: I want to talk to him first. Try to make this voluntary.

DASILVA: What?

HODGE: You can't go in alone.

SCULLY: If anything happens, you come inside. I can't do this to him until I'm sure.

(The door slides open and Mulder gets to his feet quickly, flinching.)

MULDER: It's just you?

SCULLY: Yes.

(The door slams shut. Scully turns on the light.)

MULDER: It's one of them.

SCULLY: No one's been killed since you've been in here.

MULDER: So?

SCULLY: We found a way to kill it. Two worms in one host will kill each other.

MULDER: You give me one worm, you'll infect me.

SCULLY: (whispering) If that's true, then why didn't you let us inspect you?

MULDER: (whispering) I would have but you pulled a gun on me. Now I don't trust them. I wanted to trust you.

SCULLY: (whispering) Okay. But now they're not here.

(Mulder turns around. Scully pulls down the back of his shirt and inspects his neck. No bump. Scully turns to leave but Mulder grabs her. She gasps in shock. She starts to turn her head but he gently pushes her back to facing forward. He pulls down the back of her shirt and inspects her. No bump as well. Outside, DaSilva puts the jar down on a small table with forceps.)

DASILVA: This is the last one. She's not going to let us give it to him.

HODGE: Well, she'll have to if he's infected.

DASILVA: He'll convince her somehow.

(The door slides open and Mulder and Scully walk out.)

SCULLY: I just examined him. He's... uninfected.

MULDER: So is she.

SCULLY: Which means that it must be one of you.

HODGE: All right. Go over to the main building. I'd like to check him myself. Then he can examine both of us. Wanna lead the way?

(Mulder walks forward slowly. Hodge and DaSilva start behind him then look at each other. Hodge grabs Mulder and slams him into a few boxes. DaSilva grabs Scully, throws her into the room and bolts the door. Mulder grunts and screams as Hodge bends his arm back in a hammerlock and puts on a chokehold with the other arm. DaSilva takes out the needle and preps it but it knocked down when Mulder pushes Hodge back into her. Mulder then runs Hodge back into the loading doors, but Hodge stays hooked on. He wrestles Mulder to the floor as Scully picks up a large drill bit on the floor and starts trying to break open the door. Mulder groans as banging can be heard.)

Get the worm!

MULDER: Bastards! No!

(DaSilva gets the worm with the forceps and dangles it above Mulder's ear. She holds his head down by the hair.)

Ah! Stop... no!

(Hodge looks at DaSilva and notices a bump moving around on the back of her neck.

HODGE: Oh my God!

(He pushes her down across the room. Mulder rolls to his feet as Hodge backs away from DaSilva. She slowly gets to her feet.)

Mulder! It's her!

(DaSilva makes a break for the door, slamming Mulder into the boxes again. Mulder gets up and he and Hodge run to the door where Scully is.)

MULDER: Scully!

(He opens the door.)

It's DaSilva!

(She drops the drill bit and they run after her. Hodge picks the worm up off the floor with the forceps. DaSilva runs into the lab, screaming hysterically. She opens a door and throws some jars out, then knocks over any lab equipment near her. Mulder runs in as DaSilva takes the gun in the evidence bag out of the drawer. She takes the gun out and Mulder tackles her as she fires at him. Scully runs in and they hold her down. Hodge walks in slowly.)

SCULLY: Hodge! Now!

(Mulder holds up her head so Hodge can put the worm in.)

Mulder! After this, there won't be any left!

MULDER: Do it!

DASILVA: Nooooo! No! No!

(Mulder lays her head back down and Hodge assumably puts the worm in. DaSilva's screams change to choking and coughing as she starts spasming on the floor. She moans repeatedly.)

SCULLY: It's all right. It's all over. It all stops right here. Right now.




SCENE 5
DOOLITTLE AIRFIELD; NOME, ALASKA
(DaSilva is in a containment suit and being wheeled into an ambulance by two men. They roll past Mulder, Scully and Hodge. Hodge closes the door and the ambulance drives off with her inside.)

HODGE: She's being put in quarantine along with the dog. We'll keep her there until we're sure she won't infect the rest of the population. Meanwhile, our tests came back normal so we've been released. Plane ready. Take you as far from the ice as you want to go.

MULDER: I'm going back to the site. This time, I'm going fully prepared with proper equipment. There's still a lot of research to be done on it's genetic structure, on it's origin...

HODGE: Wait, Mulder. Don't you know?

MULDER: Know what?

(Hodge looks at Mulder and Scully in a sort of disbelief.)

HODGE: 45 minutes after they evacuated us, they torched the place. There's nothing left.

SCULLY: Who did that?

HODGE: The military, centers for disease control... you oughta know. They're your people.

(He walks away.)

MULDER: It's still there, Scully. 200,000 years down in the ice.

SCULLY: Leave it there.

(She picks up her bag and starts off. Mulder looks into the distance. She looks back at him. He picks up his bag and they walk off.)

[THE END]


SCENE 1
JET PROPULSION LABORATORY
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA
1977
70'S TV REPORTER: I'm here in pasadena with the nasa mission control team as they celebrate scientific history. The first close up photographic transmissions of mars from the viking observer spacecraft. Photos that have created something of a stir by revealing surprising geologic information: the presence of large amounts of water locked in mars' polar icecaps. Water that some speculate could have possibly sustained life on the planet. Even more controversial is one image of a land formation: a formation that looks like a sculpted human face. However nasa officials are denying it as an indication of an alien civilization.

Cut to interview w/ LT COL MARCUS AURELIUS BELT - Viking Orbiter Project Director

70'S BELT: No, it's nothing more than a trick of light and shadows, a geologic anomaly. I'm afraid the only sculptors at work are the solar winds that blow across the surface of Mars at 300 miles an hour ten months a year.

(Present day - Belt's apartment. Close up of Mars face picture, Belt's keys land on it. Belt gets ready for bed. Belt asleep in bed in very fashionable burgundy PJs. Dream memory, Belt on EVA in space.)

YOUNG BELT IN SPACE: I'm seeing......I've got......

HOUSTON: How's it going out there?

YOUNG BELT: There's something out here!

HOUSTON: Can you repeat that Commander Belt?

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me! Holy God!

(Present Day Belt waking in bed. Mars face appears in ceiling over him, then comes at Belt.....AAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!




SCENE 2
SHUTTLE SPACE CENTER
CAPE CANAVERAL, FL
PRESENT DAY
(Not so good NASA stock footage of shuttle launch throughout episode)

FLORIDA: Pick up terminal sequence, NPS. You have a go to proceed.

SHUTTLE: Booster hydraulic power units have started.

SHUTTLE LAUNCH CONTROL:	This is Shuttle Launch Control with T minus one minute 15 seconds and counting.

SHUTTLE: OTC to CDR. How do you read?

FLORIDA MC: Loud and clear OVCC, go ahead.

SHUTTLE: Roger that. OVCC verified. Port set up two zero.

FLORIDA MC: Copy set up two zero.

SHUTTLE: CDR Houston, how do you read?

SCENE 4
WASHINGTON DC
TWO WEEKS LATER
(Mulder and Scully BOTH(?!) eating sunflower seeds outside on steps of building)

SCULLY: What did the note say?

MULDER: Just that they worked for NASA. (Hands over note.) They wanted to talk to somebody from the FBI.

SCULLY: Why the cloak and dagger routine?

MULDER: I have no idea.

SCULLY: Think it's a crank?

MULDER: It's beginning to look that way.

(Michelle walks past them, then turns and comes back looking very incognito)

MICHELLE: My name is Michelle Generoo. (Shakes Mulder's hand)

MULDER:	Fox Mulder...

MICHELLE: I sent you the note. (shakes Scully's hand)

SCULLY: Hi. Special Agent Dana Scully.

MICHELL:	I'm sorry to have to take these precautions. I flew up from Houston this morning. I work at the Space Center there.

MULDER:	In what capacity?

MICHELL:	I'm the Mission Control Communications Commander for the Space Shuttle Program.

SCULLY: What brings you to Washington?

MICHELLE: I have reason to believe there may be a saboteur at work inside NASA.

MULDER:	Do you have evidence of sabotage?

MICHELLE: I don't know. I may. Two weeks ago, a shuttle mission was scrubbed three seconds before lift off when an auxiliary power unit valve malfunctioned. If the flight had not been aborted, there was a great chance the liquid fuel system and the Orbiter would have exploded on the launch pad. This was sent to me in the mail. (Opens briefcase and removes pictures) It's a material analysis that shows deep grooved scoring marks inside this APU valve. Marks that could have caused a malfunction.

MULDER: Evidence of tampering?

MICHELLE: That's what it looks like, but.. according to the person who gave me your names you have expertise in unexplained phenomena, and what's unexplainable is how and when anybody could have done it.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

MICHELLE: The valve is made of ferrocarbon Titanium. To score, that material would take extreme temperatures : launch pad temperatures. If anyone at NASA were to take a look at that analysis, they would say that it would be impossible for anyone to do that type of damage undetected.

SCULLY: Do you have any idea who may have sent that to you?

MICHELLE: No. No idea. But I can tell you that the official analysis of the malfunction was simple mechanical failure.

MULDER:	Does anybody share your suspicions?

MICHELLE: If they do, they're not talking to the FBI. I believe in the space program. I believe in the people who run it, but there's another launch window tomorrow and my reasons may sound selfish, but my fiancee is a shuttle commander on that mission.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other)




SCENE 5
HOUSTON SPACE CENTER
NEXT DAY
(Mulder and Scully riding through the halls on one of those airport golf cart things)

SCULLY: Why would somebody want to sabotage the Space Shuttle?

MULDER: Well, if you were a terrorist, there probably isn't a more potent symbol of American progress and prosperity. And if you're an opponent of big science, NASA itself represents a vast money trench that exists outside the crucible and debate of the democratic process. And of course there are those futurists who believe the Space Shuttle is a rusty old bucket that should be mothballed. A dinosaur spacecraft built in the 70's by scientists setting their sights on space in an ever declining scale.

SCULLY: And we thought we could rest easy with the fall of the Soviet Union.

MULDER: Not to mention certain fringe elements who accuse our government itself of space sabotage. The failure of the Hubble Telescope and the Mars Observer are directly connected to a conspiracy to deny us evidence.

SCULLY: Evidence of what?

MULDER: Alien civilizations.

SCULLY: Oh, of course.

(Digital clock on wall counting down - 10:45:27...26...25)
(Mulder and Scully walking down corridor with guide, Mulder looking at framed posters)

MULDER: Wow, look at that – Gemini 8.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Well, the man we're gonna see? Col Marcus Aurelius Belt nearly died on that mission. Had to make an emergency landing right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

SCULLY: You remember all that stuff?

MULDER: You never wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, Scully?

SCULLY: Guess I missed that phase. (ANOTHER CLOCK ON WALL 10:39:40...39...38...37)

(Knock on door with Belt's nameplate)

BELT: (Inside) Come in. (They open door)

SCULLY: Col. Belt, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. (Shakes Belt's hand as he rises and puts on jacket) And this is...

MULDER: Col. Belt. Fox Mulder. (Extends hand) I'm a big fan. It's an honor to meet you. Y-you were a big hero to me when I was a kid.

BELT: Thank you.

MULDER: I-I stayed up all night when I was 14 to watch your space walk.

BELT: (uncomfortable) Well, now it's like a stroll around the block. So... how can I help you? (They all sit, Mulder shifting around, obviously excited in presence of his hero)

SCULLY:	This found its way to the FBI. (hands Belt picture that Michelle gave them) Do you recognize it?

BELT: Sure, it's an auxiliary power unit valve. (Hands picture back)

SCULLY: Do you have any reason to believe that the damage done to it was in an effort to sabotage the Space Shuttle Program?

BELT: No.

SCULLY: Do you have any reason to suspect sabotage at all?

BELT: No reason whatsoever. And if you have any respect for this program and for the people who have devoted their lives to it, you'll be careful to whom you make those accusations. (Mulder very uncomfortable)

SCULLY: Looking at this evidence, sir, would you consider postponing the shuttle flight until a full investigation could be conducted?

BELT: Look, I don't know where you got this specious artifact, but I can assure you every precaution has been taken to rectify the problem. We've been waiting two weeks for a window to initiate this mission. We've got a payload to deliver.

SCULLY: Col. Belt, has an internal investigation ever been done on this matter?

BELT: The part you have here, has been installed, inspected, and designed by over 100 highly trained technicians. With the security measures we take, it would be virtually impossible for one man working by himself, or two or four men, to do what you are suggesting. I can assure you there isn't a person in this facility that doesn't want to see that shuttle go into space, complete its mission, and come back like winged victory herself. And in about ten hours, God willing, you're gonna see just that.

MULDER: (grinning, as they rise) Do you think there would be a problem with us watching lift off from Mission Control?

BELT: Well, being that you'd probably go over my head anyway, please, be my guest.

MULDER: (Shaking hands again, still in awe) It was an honor, sir.

SCULLY: (Shaking hands) Thank you. (Follows Mulder out the door) Didn't you want to get his autograph?

(Mulder and Scully with some tech guy in some technical mechanical place)

TECHMECH GUY:	Where did you say you got this? (Looking at picture)

SCULLY: It came to us anonymously.

TECHMECH GUY:	Well this is an APU valve all right, but this doesn't make sense.

SCULLY: What doesn't make sense?

TECHMECH GUY:	This scoring here. This valve is made out of ferrocarbon titanium. Its -

MULDER: You didn't order the analysis?

TECHMECH GUY:	No, I've never seen this before. But we're on outside contract to NASA. They may have ordered it.

MULDER: But as a matter of course wouldn't you order a material analysis if a part malfunctioned?

TECHMECH GUY:	Every shuttle has flown with that same APU valve. We haven't had a problem. To do an analysis and redesign would delay the program for months, not to mention the cost.

SCULLY: Is it conceivable that in order to avoid these delays, the program is being pushed ahead without proper safety precaution?

TECHMECH GUY:	Look, there are about 17000 things that can go wrong with the shuttle, and about 17000 people who make sure they don't.

(Another digital clock - 8:43:40...39...38...37 See Belt standing above them on balcony listening)

SCULLY: And who makes the final determination as to its safety?

TECHMECH GUY:	Oh we make a recommendation, but ultimately, the decision is Col Belt's. (Belt leaves)

MULDER AND SCULLY: Thank you. (They start up stairs to balcony)

SCULLY: (Quietly) What do you think?

MULDER: I can't believe how much faith we put in machines.

SCULLY: You think Col Belt knows more than he's saying? That he lied about his knowledge of a saboteur?

MULDER: I can't believe that Col Belt would endanger the lives of those astronauts knowing that something might go wrong. He was an astronaut himself.

SCULLY: So you think this x-ray is bogus?

MULDER: God, I hope so.

(NASA footage of launch in progress.)




SCENE 6
SHUTTLE LAUNCH CONTROL
SHUTTLE LAUNCH CONTROL:	This is Shuttle Launch Control with T minus one minute 40 seconds and counting.

FLORIDA MISSION CONTROL:	OTC is go for orbiter access arm retract.

??????: OTC, OVCC verified.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, OVCC verified.

BELT: (With Michelle at Houston Mission Control) Here we go.

SHUTTLE LC: This is Shuttle Launch Control with T minus one minute 30 and counting.

FLORIDA MC: Final purge sequence, main engine check.

SHUTTLE: Copy purge sequence. Main engine check.

OTC: Switching off Orbiter's ground supply. On board fuel cells check.

SHUTTLE: Roger, OTC.

HOUSTON: Pick up terminal sequence, MPS.

SHUTTLE: Copy that. OTC to CDR, how do you read?

FLORIDA MC: Loud and clear.

SHUTTLE: CDR Houston, how do you read?

MICHELLE: Loud and clear.

FLORIDA MC: Side hatch close out and white room configuration complete. Retracting Orbiter arm. All systems go for APU start.

SHUTTLE: Go with APU start.

FLORIDA MC: PBSR power down and ready for launch. Transfer to internal power.

SHUTTLE: Transfer to internal power.

FLORIDA MC: Gimbaling of main engines complete. Aero surfaces in launch position.

HOUSTON: MPDR assembled. Military recorder is running.

SHUTTLE: Okay, copy.

FLORIDA MC: Oxygen vent hood retracted. External tank is at flight pressure. Ok CDR, lock your visors and initiate your O2 flow. Y'all have a good one.

SHUTTLE: Roger that.

FLORIDA MC: Go for auto sequence start. Booster hydraulic units have started. Go for main engine start. (Mulder and Scully and everybody else look really nervous)

SHUTTLE LC: T minus ten and counting. 9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...zero. Ignition. We have lift off of the shuttle Orbiter. (Lots of cheers and clapping)

FLORIDA MC: CDR Houston, bet y'all have never seen a more beautiful sight.

MICHELLE: Roger that, 10-4.

FLORIDA MC: Roger. Back to you. Lower throttle back. Main engine at 65%.

(Michelle and Mulder give each other thumbs up.)

FLORIDA MC: Roger. Throttle at 110%.

SHUTTLE: Go for SRB separation.

FLORIDA MC: Roger OTC.




SCENE 7
(Mulder and Scully walking corridor of NICE hotel.)

MULDER: I have to admit, that fulfilled one of my boyhood fantasies.

SCULLY: Yeah, it ranks right up there with getting a pony and learning how to braid my own hair.

MULDER: Come on, Scully. You have to admit that was exciting. Mission control....(playfully punches her arm)....countdown.

MICHELLE: (Running up behind them) Mulder!! Wait! Something's gone wrong.

MULDER: What happened?

MICHELLE: Something's wrong with the shuttle. We had some trouble with the solid rocket boosters, but we were able to fix it. We changed watch, I went home to try to get some sleep. I got a phone call twenty minutes ago. Communication with the shuttle had gone down. Come on. We've got to get back to Houston.




SCENE 8
WET ROAD
(Michelle's car followed by Mulder and Scully's car on wet two lane road. Scully tries to get radio station - all static)

MULDER: They have a press blackout in effect. Chances are, the media doesn't know about it.

SCULLY: Do you think this is sabotage?

MULDER: I don't know. Things go wrong all the time.

SCULLY: Yeah, but they usually fix them, right?

MULDER: Usually.

SCULLY: She's turning.

(Michelle driving. Mars face comes out of the rain and fog and .....AAAAGGGGHHHH!!! Michelle gets run off the road and car flips over.
(Mulder and Scully pull up behind overturned car and get out.)

MULDER: Michelle! I can see her.

SCULLY: Michelle!

MICHELLE: Heeelllp!

MULDER: Kneeling at passenger side of overturned car) You all right?

MICHELLE: I'm stuck!

SCULLY: Can you move?

MICHELLE: Just get me out of here. I'm wedged in! (Mulder and Scully run around to driver's side of car - duuhh)

MULDER: You all right?

MICHELLE: I'm wedged in! (Mulder reaches in)

MULDER: C'mere. Can you push with your legs?

SCULLY: Be careful.

MICHELLE: Just get me out of here!

MULDER: Okay, all right. Come on. Okay. Come on Okay. (Pulls Michelle out)

SCULLY: It's okay. Now don't try to move.

MICHELLE: Oh, I got to get back to Houston.

MULDER: What happened?

MICHELLE: I don't know. Something came at me in the fog, and the next thing I knew I was upside down.

SCULLY: Was it some kind of an animal?

MICHELLE: No. It had a face. It was... it was grotesque. I don't know what it was. (Mulder helps her stand, arms around her)

SCULLY: You okay?

MICHELLE: Yeah.




SCENE 9
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL ROOM
HOUSTON TECH: Orbiter, this is Houston. Do you copy?

SHUTTLE: Your transmission is breaking up, Houston. (Mulder, Scully and Michelle enter)

MICHELLE: What's happening?

HOUSTON TECH: We have a malf in the OMS and RCF systems. They can't get the Orbiter into attitude rotation. Temperature in the cabin is approaching 103 degrees and they have downlink transmission problems... what happened to you?

MICHELLE: I had an accident. What's their position?

HOUSTON: Just over Eastern Africa.

MICHELLE: Try patching them into the Saychelles Tracking Station. (On headset) Hang in there OTC.

MULDER:	(explaining to Scully for our benefit) The Orbiter maneuvering system has malfunctioned. Without it they can't rotate the shuttle. They need to rotate it away from the sun to keep the Orbiter cool.

HOUSTON TECH: We've got a drop in cabin pressure, 21 kilopascals and declining.

MICHELLE: They're going to burn up.

MULDER: Where's Col. Belt?

HOUSTON TECH: He's on his way.

MICHELLE: Damn it! What happened when they went to back up?

HOUSTON TECH: Back up system failed to respond.

MICHELLE: Well, what about telemetry? Can we auto-activate their systems from down here?

HOUSTON TECH: We cannot auto-activate! It's like someone's interfering with the telemetry, screwing with the uplink communications from this end.

MICHELLE: Can you trace it?

HOUSTON TECH: It'd have to be a digital processor.

MICHELLE: They'd have to be in the data banks.

MULDER: Where's that?

MICHELLE: Come on. (Mulder and Scully fling their trenchcoats on a console counter and follow Michelle up and out of the room)




SCENE 10
DATA BANK ROOM
Mulder and Scully, guns drawn, with Michelle between them. Figure runs behind Mulder. A second later, lights go out.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Emergency lights on. Mulder sees someone in corner)

MULDER: I'm a federal agent. Come on out of there. (Scully and Michelle join Mulder. Computer Tech Geek with Glasses comes out of the corner) What are you doing in here?

CTGG: I work here.

MICHELLE: (Checking him) Let me see your clearance.

CTGG: A sensor went off. There was a malfunction in one of the telemetry processors.

MICHELLE: Did you find it?

CTGG: No.

MULDER: Did you see anybody else in here? (CTGG shakes his head, lights come back on) Okay, call security. I want a search of the premises. I don't want anybody coming in or out of this building who doesn't have proper clearance.




SCENE 11
MISSION CONTROL ROOM
SHUTTLE: .....rotation maneuver.

HOUSTON: I'm breaking up, OTC.

BELT: What's the attitude of the Orbiter?

HOUSTON TECH: They're flying tail first sir, with their belly toward the sun.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Their flash evaporator system is working, but it's not enough to cool them down.

HOUSTON TECH: Cabin temperature climbing to 116.

BELT: Where's - - - (Michelle, Mulder and Scully enter)

MICHELLE: Somebody's jamming our transmissions.

BELT: Who do you mean?

MICHELLE: Somebody or something is interfering with our ground communications and scrambling our uplink telemetry. The shuttle is not responding to override signals.

BELT: I'm going to let them fly by wire. I'm cutting off telemetry.

MICHELLE: It might not work. We might lose contact for good.

BELT: We have to give it a chance to work.

MICHELLE: We have to try to bring them down.

BELT: We have to give them control of the ship, take a chance they'll be able to perform that rotation maneuver and deliver their payload.

MICHELLE: What if they can't? We could be stranding them up there.

BELT: (Pause) Abandon telemetry. Go to fly by wire mode.

MULDER: (Explaining to Scully) They're cutting off ground control to the Orbiter. The astronauts will be flying the shuttle all by themselves.

SCULLY: Is it going to work? (Mulder looks doubtful)

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. How's the weather up there?

SHUTTLE: Sunny and warm Houston. What's the forecast?

MICHELLE: OTC, we're going to fly by wire mode. We're going to abort ground control momentarily to see if you can bring those systems back up.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, Houston. And leave the driving to us.

MICHELLE: David... you take care. (Transmission broken)

SCULLY: What just happened? (Wake up, Scully)

MULDER: They cut off contact with the shuttle. (Everyone waits. Very tense)

MICHELLE: 45 seconds. If they were able to execute they'd have done it by now.

BELT: Standing by.

MICHELLE: 60 seconds.

BELT: Go to reestablish uplink communication.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Video signal's failed on them.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Do you copy? (Pause) OTC , this is Houston. Where are you?

SHUTTLE: Howdy-do, Houston. Looks like we finally got this bird to fly right. (Everyone claps and smiles, even Scully!)

MICHELLE: OTC, do you hear that?

SHUTTLE: Music to our ears.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Cabin temperature stabilizing.

BELT: OTC, this is Mark Belt in Houston. How's the crew holding up?

SHUTTLE: They're looking good, sir.

BELT: Y'all get some rest. We'll get back to work at about 0700.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, Houston.

BELT: Let's get to work on that telemetry problem. We got a big day ahead of us.

(Belt washes his face.)




SCENE 12
NASA PRESS CONFERENCE
Belt at podium, Mulder, Scully and Michelle watch from side)

BELT: I know you have a lot of questions, and I'll get to them.

SCULLY: (to Michelle) How did he know what he did was going to work?

MICHELLE: He didn't. They could have died up there and there would have been nothing we could have done. They'd have been a ghost ship stuck in orbit.

SCULLY: Why would he take that risk?

MICHELLE: Bring those men back without delivering that payload? You're talking millions of wasted dollars. That's all Congress would need to shut down NASA.

BELT: As of 2200 hours, the crew has been conducting onboard tests and tasks and resting up for their first full day in space tomorrow. I'm happy to say after a beautiful night launch the Shuttle Orbiter has performed magnificently. (Michelle leaves in disgust)

SCULLY: So much for your boyhood hero.

(Mulder following Belt down hallway)

MULDER: Col. Belt? Col. Belt? Can I talk to you for a moment?

BELT: You want to know why I lied to them. You're asking yourself if this means I'd lie to you. (Mulder nods) You know what it means to be an astronaut, sir? You risk your life every time you get into your spacecraft for nothing more than the good progress of mankind.

MULDER: You've got no argument from me, sir. You're true American heroes.

BELT: Heroes? We used to make headlines when we did our job right. Now they bury them in the back of the paper. Name me two astronauts on the last shuttle mission. (Mulder can't) You make the front page today only if you screw up. They only know your name if you're the unlucky SOB sitting on 500 tons of dynamite. That's what they're really waiting for. (Starts to go)

MULDER: Sir, I have to ask. I'm sorry, it's my job. Do you think someone is sabotaging the shuttle?

BELT: My answer to you sir, will be to bring those men back safely to earth.




SCENE 13
BELT'S APARTMENT
Belt enters, gets vodka out of the freezer, drinks it out of the bottle, lies down on bed and has another EVA memory dream.)

YOUNG BELT: My God!

HOUSTON: How's it going out there?

YOUNG BELT: There's something out here!

HOUSTON: Can you repeat that, Commander Belt?

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me! Holy God!

(See present day Belt awake on bed, his face morphing into Mars face. White ghostly thing pulls out of Belt and floats out the window and up into space. Belt sits frozen, hand outstretched.)




SCENE 14
SHUTTLE ORBITER
PASSING OVER CANADA
SHUTTLE: Uh, Houston, we just heard something weird up here.




SCENE 15
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL
HOUSTON TECH: OTC, Houston. Can you describe it?

SHUTTLE: Sort of a dull thump, like something bumped the ship. Got any ideas about that? (banging sound) There it is again.

(Computer Tech Geek with Glasses runs for the stairs and up to data room where Mulder, Scully, Michelle and techs are dissecting machines)

CTGG: (quietly to Michelle) They've got an oxygen leak on board the Orbiter.

SHUTTLE: Our O2 gauges are going all screwy, Houston.

HOUSTON TECH: (To Michelle, Mulder and Scully entering Mission Control) We got problems. We've got an O2 leak in the main tank.

MICHELLE: What did they say happened?

HOUSTON TECH: They don't know. They just said it was a thump.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: (On head set) Stand by. We have an astronomer in Winnipeg who just spotted a gaseous cloud about a mile long trailing in our orbit.

MULDER: (To Scully) That's the liquid O2 leaking out into space. The exact same thing happened to Col. Belt on an Apollo mission.

MICHELLE: How much time do they have?

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Well, that's hard to know without accurate telemetry data. I'll do the calculations, but it will just be a guesstimate.

MICHELLE: I need some answers, and where is Col. Belt?

HOUSTON TECH: We can't find him and he was due here 90 minutes ago to begin payload deployment.

SHUTTLE:	Uh, Houston? We're up here kind of wondering when we have to start holding our breath.

MICHELLE: We're working on it OTC. I need those calculations and I need a worst case scenario.

HOUSTON TECH: We don't know if one or both of the O2 tanks are damaged.

MICHELLE: Worst case scenario! And then I want someone to find Col. Belt.

MULDER: We'll find Col. Belt.

HOUSTON TECH: They've got thirty minutes of back up oxygen. Beyond that, it's anybody's guess.




SCENE 16
HALLWAY
(Mulder and Scully walking down hall)

SCULLY: Why does she need Belt?

MULDER: She doesn't know how serious the leak is.

SCULLY: It's an oxygen leak. Even I can figure out what happens when you run out of oxygen.

MULDER: Col. Belt's been up there in the same situation before. He'll know better than anybody else what to do. He's got to make the decisions.

SCULLY: Where the hell is he?

(Mulder and Scully knocking at Belt's door.)

MULDER: Col. Belt? Col. Belt!

SCULLY: I'm going to go get security.

(Belt opens door)

MULDER: Col. Belt. Are you all right?

BELT: Yeah. I wasn't feeling well.

MULDER: They need you down at Mission Control, sir. There's been another accident.




SCENE 17
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL
MICHELLE: OTC, is your orbital maneuvering system still operational?

(Belt, Mulder, and Scully enter)

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. We're ready for reentry. Just say the word.

BELT: How bad's the leak?

MICHELLE: We have no way to determine.

BELT: OTC, What's the condensation, cabin.

SHUTTLE: Windows are getting a little steamy.

MICHELLE: Carbon dioxide buildup.

BELT: Okay, OTC. Everything's going to be fine. I want you to get in your spacesuits and depressurize your cabin, and then I want you to vent that CO2.

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. And then what? (Michelle and Houston Tech look worried)

BELT: I want you to stay in your suits. And then I want you to prepare to use your emergency oxygen systems. And then I want you...to...deliver your payload.

MICHELLE: Those are men up there.

BELT: You're out of line. You want to tell me how to do my job? I've been up there in that situation, Miss Generoo. There's more at risk here than your personal life. And if you can't accept that or operate effectively in the circumstances then maybe you'd better leave the decisions to people in this room who can. (Michelle leaves. Scully follows) OTC, do you copy?

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. We're waiting on those O2 calculations. (Mulder leaves)




SCENE 18
HALLWAY
(Mulder and Scully follow a crying Michelle down the hall)

SCULLY: Michelle!

MICHELLE: They're going to die.

MULDER: You don't know that.

MICHELLE: It's absolutely unconscionable putting that payload before those men's lives.

SCULLY: I think she's right, Mulder. You saw him in there. He's losing it.

MULDER: He saved their lives earlier.

SCULLY: Did he? Or did he put their lives in unnecessary jeopardy? If he can't deliver that payload, Congress is going to kill the Space Program.

MULDER: And you think killing those astronauts isn't going to have the same effect?

SCULLY: Look, Mulder. I think somebody must have sabotaged the space shuttle because too many things have gone wrong. I think Col. Belt knows about it and he's known about it from the beginning.

MICHELLE: We have to stop him. We've got to pull them out of orbit. (Tries to go, Mulder grabs her and doesn't stop touching her for the rest of the scene. What is up with that?! She's engaged)

MULDER: He doesn't want those men to die.

MICHELLE: How do you know?

MULDER: I know it. I'm sure of it.

MICHELLE: He's the one who put them up there.

MULDER: And he may be the only person who can get them down alive. Now how can you be certain that what he's doing isn't the right thing? That what he's doing isn't going to save their lives? Now I need access to you records... in a hurry. (Michelle leads them off)




SCENE 19
COMPUTER ROOM
MULDER: (at computer with Computer Tech Geek with Glasses) I need everything on the Hubble Telescope, the Mars Observer, the Shuttle Challenger, and the current Orbiter mission.

CTGG: You're talking about tens of thousands of documents.

SCULLY: What exactly are we looking for?

MULDER: X-rays, diagrams, schematics - - any proof that Belt knew about a sabotage.

SCULLY:	A needle in a haystack.

(Mulder and Scully going through files. Mulder opens the Challenger file to picture of the O ring)




SCENE 20
MISSION CONTROL
SHUTTLE: Payload deployment initiated.

HOUSTON: Roger that, OTC. Tracking it now. (Footage of something coming out of shuttle)

SHUTTLE: Looks good from here. Payload delivery is complete, Houston. We're awaiting your order.

BELT: System check for reentry deorbit burn.

SHUTTLE: Holy God! There's something outside the ship! There's someone outside the ship!

BELT: Can you repeat that, OTC?

SHUTTLE: There's some kind of .... ghost outside the ship!

BELT: (losing it) No. Nono. NonoononooooooooooOOOOOOO!!!!




SCENE 21
FILE ROOM
SCULLY: Mulder, I found it. This is the same diagram that was sent to Michelle...ordered by Col. Belt. Which means he knew about the faulty valve.

MULDER: This is from the Challenger. It's the O ring fitting that failed dated January 21, 1986. That's one week before the space shuttle blew up. And the analysis was ordered by Col. Belt.

SCULLY: Are you saying he might have known about the Challenger defect?

MULDER: Something weird is going on here, Scully.

MICHELLE: (at door) Col. Belt's collapsed.

MULDER: Where is he?

MICHELLE: He's in his office. (they follow her out, Mulder's hand back where it belongs on Scully's lower back)




SCENE 22
BELT'S OFFICE
Mulder, Scully and Michelle enter )

MICHELLE: He was just here.

(They find Belt crying under his desk)

SCULLY: Oh my God.

MICHELLE: What's wrong with him?

MULDER: Get a doctor.

BELT: Help me. Help me.

MULDER: How can we help you, Col.?

SCULLY: He's having some kind of a seizure, Mulder.

MICHELLE: (leading EMTs in)Come on! Come on, come on!

BELT: It hurts! It's tearing me apart!

EMT1: See if I can get a bus. (They walk him to stretcher)

MICHELLE: I'm bringing that shuttle down.

BELT: Nooooo! It's out there.

EMT1: Easy, easy.

BELT: Spacesuits!

MULDER: Strap him down.

SCULLY: (Suddenly remembering 7 years of med school) Give him 10 milligrams of Diazepam.

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: He's going to hurt himself, Mulder.

MULDER: He's trying to tell us something. Col. Belt.

MICHELLE: Those men are up there and they're running out of oxygen.

BELT: They don't have to die.

MULDER: (Holding up his finger) Col. Belt, I want you to focus. Focus your breathing. Focus your pain. (Oh, this scene is bad) Right here.

EMT1: Blood pressure is 174 over 120.

SCULLY: Mulder, you're risking an anuerysm.

MULDER: Focus. (Belt calms) Now you're focused. Right here. Now you're going to save those astronauts and you're going to tell me how to do it.

BELT: The shuttle can't survive reentry.

MICHELLE: No, he's lying.

MULDER: How do you know it can't survive?

BELT: The fuselage...the fuselage is damaged. The silicone tiles are destroyed.

MICHELLE: How does he know?

MULDER: How has it been damaged?

BELT: I'm responsible.

MULDER: Did you sabotage the shuttle?

BELT: No, but I couldn't stop them. Nobody can stop them.

MULDER: Stop who?

EMT1: Pulse is 194.

SCULLY: You're going to kill him, Mulder.

MULDER: Stop who?

BELT: They don't want us to know. They don't want us to know.

MULDER: Who?

BELT: It came to me. It lives in me. (EVA flashback)

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me. It's coming at me! Get me out of here! (Ghost thing invades Young Belt's body) It's attacking me! Get me out! (Back to present)

BELT: Get it out. Help me. It's coming back. (Belt's face morphs into Mars face)

MICHELLE: That's the face I saw in the fog.

EMT1: We're losing him. Defib.

EMT2: (Handing padddles) Here you go.

EMT1: Clear.

EMT2: Hit it.

HOUSTON TECH: (in door) We've just run out of oxygen. They've got exactly thirty minutes left in the emergency backup system.

MICHELLE: They're going to suffocate up there. I've got no choice but to bring them down. It's the only chance I've got. (Michelle and Houston Tech leave)

EMT1: Again.

EMT2: Okay, we got O2 standing by. (Giving O2)

EMT1: Hold on. We've got vitals. We've got a pulse.

SCULLY: We've got to get him to a hospital.




SCENE 23
MISSION CONTROL
MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston Mission Control. Do you copy?

SHUTTLE:	Roger, Houston. We've got some spooky stuff up here.

MICHELLE: OTC, we're going to bring you down. We want you to instigate deorbit burn, and begin deceleration.

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. Kind of hoping you were going to say that. Activating OMS rockets. All systems go for reentry.




SCENE 24
HALLWAY
(Belt on gurney down hallway)

MULDER:	They're bringing the shuttle down. You said the shuttle would burn up on reentry. Is there anything we can do to save it?

BELT: Change the trajectory.

MULDER: Change the trajectory to what?

BELT: Change the reentry trajectory to 35 degrees. (Mulder and Scully run off)




SCENE 25
Mission Control
MISSION CONTROL:	T minus 35 seconds to ionosphere reentry.

MULDER: (running in) You've to change the reentry trajectory.

MICHELLE: What?

MULDER: You've got to change it to 35 degrees.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus 30 seconds to ionosphere reentry.

MULDER: Col. Belt- - -

MICHELLE: I can't.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus 25 seconds.

MULDER: It's your only shot.

MICHELLE: We...we...we'd have to change the landing site, we'd have to inform them before the blackout.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: 15 seconds to blackout.

MICHELLE: I want to know what the weather conditions are in Albuquerque. Are we go for an emergency landing?

HOUSTON TECH: Weather in Albuquerque? Landing conditions go in Albuquerque.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus five seconds to blackout.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. I want you to change your reentry trajectory to 35 degrees. You'll be landing at Kirtland Field in Albuquerque. Do you copy?

HOUSTON TECH: Ionosphere reentry. Temporary blackout in effect.

MICHELLE: Did they get that transmission?

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Two minutes to reestablish.

MICHELLE: Damn it. (Red clock reads 16:26:01...2...3) How much oxygen do we have?

HOUSTON TECH: 16 minutes.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC. (16:26:15...16...17) OTC, this is Houston. Come in OTC. Anything? (Curly shakes head) What's the point of their new reentry?

HOUSTON TECH: 500 miles west of Hawaii.

MICHELLE: See if Hawaii can get me - -

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Hawaii's picked the shuttle up on radar.

SCULLY: They made it.

HOUSTON TECH: Not necessarily.




SCENE 26
KIRTLAND AIR BASE
ALBEQUERQUE, NM
CURLY HOUSTON: Albuquerque, do you have radar confirmation?

ALBUQUERQUE: Negative, Houston. Nothing on the screen.




SCENE 27
MISSION CONTROL
(Clock - 16:26:43...44...45...46)

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC. (16:26:53...54...55) OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC.

SHUTTLE:	Houston, this is OTC. You know a good place to eat in Albuquerque?

(Big grin and laugh from...Scully? Everybody happy. Mulder and Michelle big hug.)

HOUSTON TECH: OTC, welcome home. Welcome home, OTC. You're looking real good.

SOME GUY: Yes!




SCENE 28
PRESS CONFERENCE
Michelle at press conference on TV)

MICHELLE: The Space Shuttle touched down today at 10:56 Central Standard Time. The Orbiter delivered it's payload after just thirteen orbits and returned to Earth...without incident. (Belt is watching the TV. He is hooked to machines in hospital) We at NASA are looking forward to our next shuttle mission and to future successful explorations of space, for mankind, and the future of mankind.

(Belt's machines beep wildly, his face does the Mars morph, he rips off, the tubes, fights with the ghost, yells “no”a few times, and flings himself through the glass window. Alternating images of him on EVA in space and of the street intersection below coming rapidly closer. AAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!)




SCENE 29
X-FILES OFFICE
WASHINGTON, DC
(Mulder reads obituary Former Astronaut Space Program Plunges to Death. Scully enters)

SCULLY: I just heard.

MULDER: Something had possessed him. Something he must have seen out there in space.

SCULLY: The doctors who examined him said he was experiencing severe dementia.

MULDER: I don't think he ever really knew exactly how it was working through him or that he ever knew...that he was...responsible for his own actions.

SCULLY: He ordered those x-rays of the damaged parts.

MULDER: You saw what I saw, Scully. I think he was trying to warn her. I think that he sent Michelle those x-rays like he was trying to reach out to her without quite knowing why, as if...his own instinctual impulse was to save those men.

SCULLY: While simultaneously trying to kill them?

MULDER: Hey, Scully, we send those men up into space to unlock the doors of the universe, and we don't even know what's behind them. I think what ever it was, he took it with him. And in the end that was the only way he knew how to stop it.

SCULLY: There's an investigation, you know. They haven't ruled out foul play.

MULDER: He gave his own life. As an astronaut, that was something he was prepared to do.




SCENE 30
MILITARY FUNERAL
Mulder and Scully have really good seats)

MINISTER: ...for Col. Marcus Aurelius Belt devoted his life to the exploration and understanding of Space, learning its mysteries and experiencing it not just for himself, but for humanity. Lord, take this man's soul and let it rise up to your heavens, higher than he could ever go as a man. Let him know the true nature of the universe that he sought to learn.

(Michelle and her fiancee watch planes fly over. Michelle and Mulder have a shared look and nod. Close up of flag on coffin.)

TOWNSEND, WI
12:57 AM
DAY 1
Explosion in woods. Police vehicle pulls up.

DEPUTY WRIGHT: We have a fire off county road D7. Two miles west of the canyon ridge intersection.
Suggest we dispatch fire crews. (static) This is Deputy Wright. Do you copy?
(static) Son of a....(exits vehicle) Walks around car towards explosion



SCENE 2
US SPACE SURVEILLANCE CENTER
CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, CO
MALE OFFICER #1: Sir? Sorry to disturb you sir. But we just picked up an unidentified bogey. I think you should see the replay for yourself.
(both officer and chief walk toward info area)

MALE OFFICER #1: It tripped the fence at 23-17 off the coast of Conneticut, sir.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Initial trajectory was north by northwest. Then it started going crazy.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: What about other craft in the area...missle testing?

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Sir. No known aircraft can maneuver like this.

MALE OFFICER #1: Well, whatever it was dropped of the screen at 24-18 sir. Hit ground just west of Lake Michigan outside Townsend Wisconsin.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: The tracking and impact team predicted impact calculated at over 800 miles an hour.

MALE OFFICER #1: I've instructed Cheif Koretz to to start her report right away...

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Negative. What she tracked was a meteor. Its abberant movement was obviously due to instrument malfunction.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: But sir...

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Your report will reflect these facts. Is that clear?

MALE OFFICER #1: Yes sir.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Good.
(Colonel exits, walks to deserted corner. Dials cell phone)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Code indigo delta echo niner. I have a confirmed fallen angel in sector 87.
Mobilize Operation Falcon Immediately.


SCENE 3
(In forest, deputy walking through woods, sees another explosion. Camera shown rushing up to and past Deputy )
DEPUTY WRIGHT: Hello?
(Deputy scans woods with flashlight. Lights of police vehicle can be seen over his shoulder in distance. Camera rushes straight up to the Deputy. Bright flashes of white light, strobe light effect as Deputy screams)


SCENE 4
BUDGET-REST MOTEL
TOWNSHEND, WI
12:57 AM

(Voice from Television Report)
...still have no comment until the government investigation now under way is completed. Government officials remain vague about the toxic cargo that has caused the immediate evacuation of Townshend Wisconsin's 12,000 residents. Speculation here has centered on a shipment of toxic waste...(fades out)

(shot of Mulder in foreground checking his gun)
[Flashback]

MULDER: Then what happened out there if it wasn't a train wreck?

DEEP THROAT: Mulder the continental United States is surrounded by an electronic fence that reaches 15,000 miles into space. We use it to track and monitor the 7,087 man-made objects that orbit the earth. Last night at 23-17 that fence was breached.
[Mulder shown back in hotel testing flashlight on hand]

DEEP THROAT: (contines)This morning at 0100 Operation Falcon went into effect Led by Colonel Calvin Henderson--The Air Force's premiere reclamations expert.

MULDER: Reclamations?

DEEP THROAT: During the cold war his job was to prevent technologies from downed US aircrafts from  getting into Soviet hands.

MULDER: He's part of a craft retrieval unit.

DEEP THROAT: Mm Hmm(looking down). Quick response. I'd say you have...24 Hours before the entire area is sanitized. After that it will be like nothing has happened.



SCENE 5
Mulder seen running through woods: wearing backpack. Approaches "laser" fence Walks around what is obviously military campsight. Helicopter flies overhead, large trucks check in at main gate. Military men all around.


SCENE 6
OPERATION FALCON
FIELD HEADQUARTERS
(CCH and L1 walk out of tent)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You're late, Liutenant.. Its going to be dark in a half hour.

LIEUTENANT: We had a flat outside the peremiter, sir.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: There's a general briefing at 2200 hours. But first got to headquarters for the live rounds.

LIEUTENANT: Live rounds, sir?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You have a problem with that?

LIEUTENANT: No sir. We were told this was just a drill.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: They told you wrong.

LIEUTENANT: (To soldiers in truck) OK! Everyone out!

(soldiers exit truck)
Mulder drops from bottom of truck, walks into forest.

Forest at night. Armed soldiers walk through on patrol. Mulder walks by. Mulder sees light in distance, walks toward it. Approaching lit area, crouches down. Men yelling. Whooshing noises. Mulder sees crash site lit with heavy lights. Men walk around crash site in protective gear spray area. Mulder takes photos of this scene. Man approaches Mulder from behind. Mulder turns around, is hit in face with gun.



SCENE 7
(Inside tent at Operation Fallen Angel headquarters. Close up shot of camera film being exposed to light)
COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You just made the worst mistake of your life, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I think you knocked out a filling.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: I'll see to it you that pay the price for putting my men at risk.

MULDER: Since when does taking pictures put anyone's life at risk?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You violated a US government quarantine and thats a federal crime.

MULDER: That's a quarantine? Is that what you call this?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: We're trying to contain an ecological disaster.

MULDER: Thats a lot of firepower just to protect mother nature.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: I have my orders. And a license to execute them as a I see fit. I suggest you forget what you saw, what you think you saw for your own well being.

MULDER: You've got a downed craft in those woods, sir. And troops carrying live rounds ! We both know what's out there!



SCENE 8
(Mulder escorted into temporary chain-link-fence brig)
MAX FENIG: Are you MUFON or CUFOS? (Approaches out of shadows, wears baseball cap backwards, glasses, long blonde hair) Do you mind if I sit down? Let me guess you're with that new group--CSICOP, right? (Mulder looks away) Um, say no more. You're a cautious man. Trust no one. Very wise. After what happened to JFK I understand completely. (Mulder looks back) Oh, let me introduce myself. My name is Max Fenig. I'm with the National Investigative Committee of Arial Phenomenon...NICAP (Turns around hat to display the initials). Pleased...pleased to make you're acquanitance. Wish we could shake on it, you know. Firm grip, look you right in the eye. You learn a lot about a guy that way. (Mulder looks away) Hey, uh... Can I ask you a question?

MULDER: Go ahead.

MAX FENIG: Did you see anything? Did you get close? Me, I saw nothing. (talks loudly to anyone who may be listening) I didn't see anything! (To Mulder) Nada, zip. Hundred yards past the road block they nailed me. I have no idea how they did it. I'm telling you its like the Roswell cover up all over again.

MULDER: What makes you so sure that something's out there?

MAX FENIG: (laughs) Same thing that makes you so sure?



SCENE 9
(Dawn at camp. Empty bunk in cell. Pans to next cell, Mulder asleep as door opens.
Scully enters.)
MULDER: I didn't order room service.

SCULLY: This isn't funny, Mulder.

MULDER: Did you meet Max?

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: Max from NICAP. (Looks to empty bunk) Oh, they must have released him.
Another intrepid soul in seach of a close enounter.

SCULLY: Is that what this is about?

MULDER: What else?

SCULLY: Try explaining that to Section Cheif McGrath. He stepped over Blevins ordering a full inquiry. With a recommendation...Mulder he wants to shut down the X-files. And he wants you out of the bureau.

MULDER: So what else is new?

SCULLY: I don't understand you Mulder. Why you're always defying protocol? Ignoring jurisdiction...

MULDER: Because I know what I saw Scully. There weren't train tracks anywhere near that site. So how could it have been a derailed container?

SCULLY: Because it wasn't. What you saw was not a toxic spill. But it wasn't a UFO either.

MULDER: OK. I'm all ears. What was it?

SCULLY: It was a downed Libyan jet with a nuclear warhead. (Mulder laughs) Over US air space... They'd been picking up low grade levels of radiation indicating that a plutonium casing may have cracked. So to avoid mass panic...

MULDER: You really believe that story..?

SCULLY: That story happens to be highly classified.

MULDER: A highly classified lie. (Helicopter passes overhead) They're searching for someone Scully.

SCULLY: If they're searching for anyone, its probably the pilot.

MULDER: You think they'd roll out all of this material for one Libyan fighter jock? (pause)
Besides, no human pilot walked away from the wreckage I saw.

SCULLY: Well, maybe he ejected.

MULDER: Maybe.



SCENE 10
(a Predator-like figure [i.e. see-through, yet produces a visible aura-kinda thing] approaches the laser fence. Pausing outside it as A military truck drives down nearby road, it then runs through the laser fence, and across the road behind the truck.)


SCENE 11
MULDER and SCULLY walk from car to motel door.

SCULLY: You can't be serious!

MULDER: As long as we're here in beuartiful downtown Townsend, why not?

SCULLY: Mulder, the hearing is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

MULDER: That gives us 24 hours to investigate.

SCULLY: My assignment is to bring you back, not to help you dig yourself in deeper.

MULDER: "The Last Detail" starring Dana Scully

(Both enter hotel room. Room is a mess. Phone is off the hook)

SCULLY: What's going on?

MULDER: Looks like housekeeping hasn't been here yet.

SCULLY: Who would...

MULDER: SH...

(noise from bathroom. Both draw guns and approach bathroom. Entering bathroom both see the rear legs of a man sticking as he tries to fit through the bathroom window)

MULDER: Max?

SCULLY: Get your hands up!

MAX FENIG: Whoa. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

MULDER: Max?

MAX FENIG: (Takes off hat) Ahem..

(Mulder brings Max into bedroom, sits him on the bed)

MAX FENIG: My apologies. Forgive me please. I'm a curious man. I had to know..

MULDER: Know what?

MAX FENIG: If it was really you.

MULDER: But you don't know me. Last night is the first time you've laid eyes on me.

MAX FENIG: Not true. We at NICAP have been following your career really closely. Ever since you became involved with the X-files.

MULDER: Following my career? How?

MAX FENIG: Through the Freedom of Information Act.Your travel expenses are a matter of public record. (Pauses and looks at Scully) So, this must be the enigmatic Agent Scully. (Max moves toward her extending his hand, Mulder pushes him back onto the bed)

MULDER: How did you recognize me?

MAX FENIG: I saw your picture in a trade magazine once. And of course I read your article in Omni about the Gulf Breeze sightings.

MULDER: I published that under a pseudonym.

MAX FENIG: M.F. Luder. I know. M.F. Luder is an anagram for F. Mulder. You really didn't think that would fool us did you?

MULDER: I didn't think anyone was really paying attention

MAX FENIG: Somebody's always paying attention Mr. Mulder.

SCULLY: A-mazing.

MAX FENIG: Amazing? Hardly. You want to see something amazing? Come with me.
(Mulder heads out of motel room)

MULDER: (looking at Scully) *Enigmatic* Dr. Scully.



SCENE 12
(Max leads them to trailer in motel parking lot)
MAX FENIG: This is my, uh...Right this way.

(Inside trailer. Max begins to search around trailer. Scully begins to look around)

MAX FENIG: Okay. Where's those, uh...They were right here. Oh, here they are. The latest crop circle photos from Project Argus. Huh? Your opinion fact or fraud.

MULDER: Fraud.

MAX FENIG: How do you explain the anamolous blisters on the plants?

MULDER: Some unreported weathering effects common to wheat or a systematic reaction to the plant tissue to being lodged in one position.

(Dana notices medication on a shelf. Picks up one prescription and reads it: MELLARIL)

MAX FENIG: (To Mulder) I see you've read the literature.

MULDER: I try to keep up.

MAX FENIG: What about the...

MULDER: Max! You said you had something to show us.

MAX FENIG: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. (All three approach electronic equipment) Wolf Ear 2000. Did you ever hear of this?

SCULLY: Yeah. Wolf Industries supplied the CIA with all of its surveillance equipment.

MAX FENIG: State of the art, search and intercept. Up to 100 channels per second. Currently I'm jacked into local fire and police departments, cellular pathways, and when the weather's right sometimes even air traffic control from Whitmarsh Air Force Base.

MULDER: What have you got Max?

MAX FENIG: Mobil Unit Broadcast. In Scan Mode. Townshend Shariff's deparment. Two nights ago.

(--recording--)
We got a fire of county road D7. Two miles west of the canyon ridge intersection. Suggest we dispatch fire crews, over? This is Deputy Wright. Do you copy?

MAX FENIG: And this. 35 minutes later. Presumably from the fire crew. Reception got wiggy for some reason.

(--recording--)
This is unit 53. Man down. Request medivac. I said request medivac! You're breaking up!
Very. Bad. VERY bad. Wait a second. What the hell? Charlie, we've got a situation here!



SCENE 13
(Operation Falcon headquarters)
COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: (on phone) We put up a tight net. (pause) Yes sir. Every inch of ground is being covered, dug up, squeezed and sifted. (pause) No, sir. It will not get away. Not this time.



SCENE 14
MILLS ROAD HIGH SCHOOL
EMERGENCY EVACUATION CENTER
6:27 PM
DAY 2
(People scattered on cots in make-shift evacuation center)

MULDER: Mrs. Wright? Hi. I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. We're from the FBI. We'd like to ask
you a few questions about your husband.

MRS WRIGHT: He's dead. What else is there to know? (walks away toward empty cot with young boy)

SCULLY: I'm sorry about your husband.

MRS WRIGHT: Oh, please.

SCULLY: Mrs. Wright, we want to help you.

MRS WRIGHT: Then leave me alone.

MULDER: Why won't you let us help you?

MRS WRIGHT: I don't know anything! (Looks from one agent to another.Sits down) Don't you understand? They won't even release the body so I can give him a proper burial. OK?

SCULLY: The government can't do that. I'm sure if you appealed to...

MRS WRIGHT: No!

SCULLY: You're entitled to the truth.

MRS WRIGHT: I can't afford the truth. They said that if I spoke to anyone, they would withhold my husband's pension. And I have a child to take care of.
(Lights go out in the evacuation center)



SCENE 15
US MICROWAVE SUBSTATION B21
COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON has earphones on. (high pitch screech) CCH pulls of earphones.

MILITARY POLICEMAN: Picking up extremely high frequency signal--200,000 Mhz (static screeching) Sir, target. onthe northeast side, Footspeed-- seven miles per hour sir

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: (Speaking into headset) Beta team

BETA TEAM LEADER: Copy

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Target entering your section from the southwest. Search and destroy. Repeat, Search and Destroy

BETA TEAM LEADER: Yes sir!

(Two teams of two men apeice in tactical gear. Guns drawn, surveying area. Looking around, and up to ceiling. The two teams split up in opposite directions, but keeping visual contact)

BETA TEAM LEADER: : Jackson?

JACKSON: Nothing.

(Looks to other team. Team leader shakes head--no. Camera as entity. Approaches B1 and Jackson. Draws back, heads toward other team)

BETA TEAM LEADER: Must have been an animal.

(Other team. Entity approaches. Bright white light. Both teams are knocked to ground.)



SCENE 16
COUNTY HOSPITAL
TOWNSEND, WI
11:42 PM
DR. OPPENHEIM: I'm sorry, but unless you have a subpoena I can't discuss patient information.

SCULLY: Does that mean Jason Wright was your patient?

DR. OPPENHEIM: It means I have nothing more to say about this.

MULDER: What about his wife and child, Doctor? Would you have anything to say to them? Because whoever got to you also got to her. They must have some pretty big threats. What did they hold over your head? Your medical licence, the IRS?

DR. OPPENHEIM: I hate fascists.

MULDER: Excuse me?

DR. OPPENHEIM: The men who came in here. The way they pushed us all around.

MULDER: Dr. Oppenheim. Tell us about the deputy. You saw him that night, didn't you?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Yes. And three others from the fire crew. They were all DOA with 5th and 6th degree burns over 90 percent of their bodies. Although they weren't like any burns I've ever seen. And they took the bodies away before we could perform any pathologies.

SCULLY: Did you note any cadaver acute heat rigor or heat stiffening?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Yes, actually there was quite a bit of heat inflection in the limbs. How do you know so much about it?

MULDER: Doctor, in your opinion, could those burns have been caused by ionizing radiation?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Well, I hadn't thought...I suppose its possible. If the exposure was significantly intense.



SCENE 17
(walking down hallway)
[Hospital PA: Code Five. All available teams and nonessential...fades out]
SCULLY: Lets say those men died from radiation exposure. Couldn't it have been from the cracked core of a nuclear warhead?

MULDER: I've read about these kinds of burns, Scully.

SCULLY: Yeah, so have I. In Hiroshima at Ground Zero.

MULDER: I'm talking about close encounter mortalities. I have a stack of X-files recording the same clinical results.

SCULLY: Mulder I don't claim to know all the answers, but if we don't make the OPR inquest by tomorrow morning, there may not be any more X-files.

(Sudden commotion as men in military uniform are brought in on stretchers. Men have severe burns. Moaning. CCH follows them in. Looking directly at Mulder as he passes)



SCENE 18
(SCULLY and MULDER back in emergency room with DR. OPPENHEIM and COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON. Men in military men lay on gurneys in various positions of the ER. Medical personnel scurry around frantically. DR. OPPENHEIM is checking on a burn patient wearing a military uniform)
DR. OPPENHEIM: Start an IV here stat.

MULDER: (to HENDERSON) Tell us what happened out there?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Whatever happened, Mulder, it has nothing to do with you.

MULDER: Wrong colonel. We both want the same thing. Only you want it dead. Can't you see that chasing it down like an animal you leave it no choice but to defend itself? How many more people have to die before you rethink your approach?

(Off camera: Are we going to get anybody from ICU in here. We need help)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Listen to me. Cause I'm not wasting another breath on this. If you and your partner aren't out of here in 30 seconds ...

DR. OPPENHEIM: Agent Scully stays right here. We're undermanned. She's a medical doctor. She stays.
(To SCULLY) If that's OK with you.

SCULLY: Of course, I...

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Doctor, if you don't mind, you just take care of my men, and let me do my work, OK?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Outside this emergency room, you can do whatever you want, But in here I call the shots. Assuming of course, you want me to take care of your men.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: (Pauses a moment) Get this man out of my sight! (Nods to Mulder)

SCULLY: I'll scrub up.
(Mulder is led out)



SCENE 19
(Mulder gets out of a car in a parking lot, and heads to Max's trailer.)
MULDER: Max? (knocking) Hey, Max. Max?

(Max lying on ground in convulsions. Mulder tries to hold him still. The convulsions subside.)

MULDER: Hey... Max

MAX FENIG: Who...who are you?

MULDER: Max.. Its me. Fox Mulder.. Are you OK?

MAX FENIG: What are you doing here?

MULDER: You were haveing some kind of seizure.

MAX FENIG: Seizure? That's impossible.

MULDER: You were lying on the floor. Unconscious. Convulsing.

MAX FENIG: Thats odd. I haven't had an episode in seven years. Not since I went on medication.

MULDER: Lets get you to the hospital.

MAX FENIG: No! I mean, I mean its not necessary.

MULDER: Are you sure?

MAX FENIG: Yeah. I've lived with epilepsy all my life. I'm not in any danger.
(Mulder gets glass of water, gives it to Max)

MAX FENIG: Yeah. It started in South Dakota when I was ten. The doctor said I must have incurred a
head injury. I don't remember hitting my head.

MULDER: And when you have a seizure, you have no memory of it?

MAX FENIG: As a kid I used to wake up in strange places with no idea where I was, or how I got there.
(sighs) Sorry I... (hands Mulder water) I've got to get some sleep.

(Mulder helps him to bed. As Max lies down, Mulder notices mark behind his ear.)

(SCULLY enters - sighing)

MULDER: Rough night, huh?

SCULLY: It was terrible. We lost all but two. And they're still in critical condition on their way to the burn unit at John's Hopkins.

MULDER: So what do you think, Scully? What's going on out there?

SCULLY: I don't know. And under other circumstances, I would like to find out, but we have a plane to catch in just over an hour...(heads toward door)

MULDER: I want you to take a look at something first.

SCULLY: What? (turning around)

MULDER: Max. There's an unsual incision bechind his left ear. I've seen this incision twice before. Two women. A thousand miles apart. No way of knowing each other. No relation. Both claim to have been abducted by aliens.

SCULLY: Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee? Mulder, the man is taking powerful anti-psychotic drugs. I saw them in his RV.

MULDER: They're for his epilepsy.

SCULLY: Not all of them. DILANTIN is an anti-convulsant, but MELLARIL is used exclusively to treat schitzophrenia. More than likely, Max is delusional.

MULDER: You don't seem to understand Scully. Max doesn't believe he was abducted by aliens, I believe he was. Now could you at least take a look at the scar, and give me you medical opinion?

SCULLY: Okay. You pack. I'll take a look at Max...on the way to the airport.



SCENE 21
US SPACE SURVEILLANCE CENTER
CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, CO
CAPTAIN KORETZ: Sir I have flash traffic at 24-18. Repeated calls for ID go unanswered. And its not in the orbital or suborbital inventory.

MILITARY OFFICER #2: 24-18. Isn't that where...

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Same exact spot sir. Although I am reading a much larger craft his time.

MILITARY OFFICER #2: Meteor, Ms. Koretz.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: A much larger Meteor, sir. Hold on a second.(Putting hand to earpeice) We have a confirm. Whitmarsh Air Force BAse is tracking...

MILITARY OFFICER #2: Where is it?

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Well, sir. The meteor, seems to be hovering over a small town in Eastern Wisconsin.



SCENE 22
(Overhead shot of Max's trailer. Camera enters through vent. Sees Max in bed, asleep on his left side. Approaches his right ear, blood trickles out. Max lifts head. Blood is also on the pillow. Max opens his eyes.)


SCENE 23
(Scully and Mulder approach the trailer.)
SCULLY: Come on, Mulder. Lets get this over with.

MULDER: (Knocking on trailer) Hey, Max. (opens trailer) Max!

(Inside the trailer, a frequency scanner chatters.)

MULDER: Max?

SCULLY: Mulder - look at this. (pointing to blood on the pillow)

MULDER: What is that, blood?

Mulder and Scully stand in front of the scanner, looking and listening.

SCANNER: Repeat.......patrol reporting unidentified tresspass at the waterfront. This is Henderson.
Move on target. (Mulder looks at Scully, and leaves the trailer)



SCENE 24
SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Come on.(Heading towards the car)

SCULLY: Where do you think you are going? Look, if we go to the airport right now, we might make
the plane. Which would at least give you half a chance of defending yourself.

MULDER: Think about is Scully. Max is a gypsy. A nomad, right?

SCULLY: Yeah, so what?

MULDER: So he intercepted Deputy Wright's last call to his dispatcher. Which means he was here in Townsend Wisconsin the night of the crash. Of all the places he could of been, he was right here. Don't you think thats more than a coincidence. If Max was abducted that would go a long way to explaining his obsession. And if we've figured it out, you can be sure Col. Henderson has as well. Do you have the keys? (SCULLY hands over keys.)



SCENE 25
LAKE MICHIGAN WATERFRONT, MI
DOCK 7
(Max walks along the dock, his right hand holding his ear, panting. Two men in a military jeep pull up.)

MAX FENIG: Don't do this.

ARMY MAN 1: Sir, we've apprehended the target. Its just a civilian.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Negative, Falcon patrol. Take him with extreme caution.

(MULDER and SCULLY pull up. Two military men are lying on the ground, with smoke pouring off their charred bodies.)

SCULLY: They're dead.

(Screams are heard in the distance)



SCENE 26
(MULDER and SCULLY enter warehouse.)

MAX FENIG: It hurts. It hurts. Please stop. It hurts.

MULDER: Max?

MAX FENIG: It hurts. It hurts.

MULDER: Max. Its alright.

MAX FENIG: It hurts. Stop it. No, no. It's me they... (helicopter can be heard overhead) They're coming for me. Now I know....They're coming for me. That's why they're here.
(Mulder motions to the helicopter and SCULLY leaves the warehouse.)



SCENE 27
(Outside warehouse. Military jeeps and transport vehicles pull up outside warehouse.
COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: gets out of jeep.)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Alpha team, secure the room.

OFFCAMERA: Stop right there. Put your hands up, and come with us.

(Scully is escorted by two men in fatigues to CCH. Two men in blue uniforms seen placing plastique on large loading dock doors)

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Alpha team ready on the roof.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Roger alpha .

DELTA TEAM LEADER: Delta team in position sir.

SCULLY: (to CCH) What are you doing? You have a very sick man in there.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: We're not in the hospital now, Doctor Scully.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Omega team report.

OMEGA TEAM LEADER: Omega Team in position.

SCULLY: He's a delusional schitzophrenic.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Keep her clear!

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Sir, this is Alpha Team Leader.(Looking through heat-source sensing device) I'm picking up three forms inside the structure.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Did you say three forms?

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Two are proximate. The third approaching from 30 meters.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: All teams prepare to go in 30 seconds



SCENE 28
(Inside warehouse)
MULDER: Come on. Come on, Max.

MAX FENIG: Why... Stop. Why?

MULDER: I'm hear to help you.

MAX FENIG: I'm scared.

MULDER: I know.

MAX FENIG: Don't let them take me.

MULDER: I won't let them take you. Come on, Max. Come with me.

MAX FENIG: NO!!

(Camera as creature rushes in towards Max and Mulder. Mulder is thrown clear. When he stands up, Max is gone)

MULDER: Max! Max!(Mulder limps off in another direction) MAX!

(Mulder sees Max suspended in a light in the middle of the warehouse. His feet aren't touching the ground. With explosive sound, light gets brighter. Max begins to shake. Mulder watches until light gets too bright. Light washes out.)



SCENE 29
(Outside warehouse)
ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Sir this is Alpha team leader. Except for our men, I'm only picking one figure inside.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: I *Do Not* copy that.

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: We indicate only one figure inside the building.

SCULLY: What?!

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Blow the door!

(Plastique blows off door. Men enter running. Mulder limps over to place where Max was. Picks up Max's NICAP hat which is lying on the floor.)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Where is he?

MULDER: He's gone. They got to him first. They beat us Colonel.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Arrest him...and keep looking.

FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC
OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY HEARING
10:17 AM
DAY 4

(Scully sits at one end of a long table. Section Chief McGrath, a stenographer, and two other men in suits are sitting at the far end)

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Agent Scully, to the best of your knowledge was Agent Mulder ever assigned to investigate matters related to the evacuation of Townshend, Wisconson?

SCULLY: No, sir

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: At any time were you aware of his submitting a form 302 requesting said assignment or travel expenses?

SCULLY: No, sir.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: While in Wisconsin, did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus registered to the state car rental agency.

SCULLY: Yes.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Thank you, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Sir. Request permision to make a statement.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Request denied.

SCULLY: Sir, its unfair to judge Mulder by the same criteria...

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: You're dismissed Agent Scully.

SCULLY: But sir, I...

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: THAT will be all.
(Scully stands up and leaves room)



SCENE 31
(Mulder sits in hallway, reading a newspaper. Crutches lean against the wall behind him.
Scully exits from room into hallway)
MULDER: Do you hear that sound Scully? (picks up crutches) Hammer and nails. They're building a gallows in the town square. Don't worry. (Scully bends down, picking up a large envelope) It was only a matter of time. (Hands envelope to Mulder) I'm surprised I lasted this long.

SCULLY: Good luck

MULDER: (limping on crutches) I'll break a leg.

(Dana watches Mulder enter room. Picks up paper and reads story: Title: Toxic Clean Up a Success Subtitle: Wisconsin residents allowed back to their homes)



SCENE 32
SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: ...as well as insubordination and misconduct. How do you respond to these allegations, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Over a dozen men lost their lives and you want me to respond to issues of protocol?

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: You failed to obtain proper authorization for your actions.

MULDER: Because I knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: You also violated a federal quarantine....

MULDER: (Raising his voice) A cover up was underway...

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: (Raising his voice)...exposing yourself and possibly others to toxic contamination.

MULDER: (Yelling) Oh, toxic contamination? Are we back in that? You read my report, explain the disapearance of Max Fenig.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Your report is not the subject of this inquiry...

MULDER: I have further evidence to support my conclusions -- X-rays taken while Mr. Fenig was institutionalized show an object lodged in his cerrebelum (Waves the envelope)

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: That is irrelevant Agent Mulder.

MULDER: The man was abducted. We all know it. Everybody in this room knows it.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: (Increasingly agitated) Colonel Henderson's written testimony states that Fenig's body was found two hours later in a cargo container.

MULDER: Then what can I say? (Stands up) How can I disprove lies that are stamped with an official
seal?

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: That will be all Mr. Mulder.

MULDER: You can deny all the things I've seen. All the things I've discovered. But not for much longer. Because too many others know what's happening out there. And no one. No government agency has jurisdiction over the truth. (Takes crutches and envelope, and leaves)



SCENE 33
(Section chief McGrath stalks up to Deep Throat. Both are standing in the courtyard outside an office building)
SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Why did you countermand my decision? Mulder's conduct was in clear violation not only of bureau procedures but of federal law.

DEEP THROAT: Yes.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: I don't understand. The committee's case was air tight. You've ruined the last best chance we had to get rid of him.

DEEP THROAT: I appreciate your frustration, but you and I both know Mulder's work is a singular passion -- poses a most unique dilemma. But his occasional insubordination is in the end, far less dangerous.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: With respect sir, less dangerous than what?

DEEP THROAT: Than having him exposed to the wrong people.What he knows...(laughs)... what he thinks he knows...(sighs) Always keep your friends close, Mr. McGrath... but keep your enemies closer.

(Deep Throat walks off.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT
A barking dog is heard in the distance. It's a nice upper class neighborhood. The camera pans to a white two story house. A couple jog by and look over at the house.

WOMAN: What's she doing there by herself?

(There is a little girl, Teena Simmons, 8, who is standing at the end of the driveway of the white house holding a big stuffed bunny. They jog to her.)

MAN: Teena?

WOMAN: Honey? (The woman reaches out to Teena.)

WOMAN: You're freezing. Where's your jacket?

MAN: Where's your Daddy?

TEENA: In the yard. He told me he needed some time to himself.

MAN: I'd say his time's up.

WOMAN: Come on, Honey. I'm sure he wouldn't want you to catch cold.




SCENE 2
BACKYARD
They go to the back yard. There is a man sitting in the backyard swing. The man walks to him as he talks.

MAN: Joel? Hey, Joel... The swing set's supposed to be for your daughter, not for you.

(He touches Joel and he falls to the side. He's pure white, has a ghost look on his face, glazed eyes and has two puncture marks on his neck. Teena screams.)

MAN: I'll call 911.

TEENA: Daddy?




SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
Scully and Mulder in their office. Mulder is looking at slides.

SCULLY: Death by hypovolaemia. 95% blood loss. That's over 4 liters of blood.

MULDER: I'd say the man was running on empty.

SCULLY: The man's daughter, 8 years old... was away from his side for no more than 10 minutes. She doesn't remember anything, there was no trace evidence found at the crime scene.

MULDER: Any evidence would have be washed away by yesterday's rain.

SCULLY: Oh, there were two small puncture wounds.

MULDER: Are you at all familiar with the phenomena of cattle mutilations?

(He goes to the slide projector and shows slides of mutilated cattle to Scully as he talks.)

MULDER: Since 1967, over 34 states have reported unsolved cases of cattle mutilations. Trace evidence is remarkably similar. Incision marks of surgical precision. The area around the mouth and often the sexual organs have been removed. There's a substantial degree of blood loss but not a trace of blood at the scene.

SCULLY: How could that be?

MULDER: Exsanguination. If you were to stick a needle into the jugular of any living creature, the heart itself would act as a pump. These animals have had their jugulars punctured the same as the man in Greenwich, CT. Although this is the first time I've ever seen it on a human being.

SCULLY: But there was no sign of a struggle. How could a man just sit through a blood letting?

MULDER: The ME found traces of digitalis, a South American plant that can be used as a paralytic drug.

SCULLY: Wait a minute. These X-Files indicate UFO related phenomena. Often there are related sightings in the sky near the incidences, along with surface burns...

MULDER: Witnesses often relate time loss. We've seen this in abduction cases. That might explain why the girl can't remember anything.

SCULLY: Mulder, why would alien beings travel light years through space in order to play doctor on cattle?

MULDER: For the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys. Besides, they seem to have stepped up their interest.

(Mulder points to the slide of the father, Joel and his puncture wounds on his neck.)




SCENE 4
FAIRFIELD COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES HOSPITAL GREENWICH, CT
We see through the window that Teena is in a bed.

HALLWAY

A social worker leads Mulder and Scully through a hall and up some stairs.

SOCIAL WORKER: Her mother passed away from ovarian cancer two years ago. There's no other family. We'll keep Teena here until we can place her with a foster family.

MULDER: Has she spoken about it?

SOCIAL WORKER: No. Not a word.

MULDER: Any nightmares?

SOCIAL WORKER: No. At least, not that I know of.

(They get to a door with a round window and look in.)

SCULLY: Can we talk to her now?

(They knock on Teena's door and open it.)




SCENE 5
TEENA'S ROOM
They enter. Teena is sitting up in bed holding a stuffed bunny. Scully sits on Teena's bed. Mulder sits in a chair.

SOCIAL WORKER: Teena? These are the people we talked about. This is Miss Scully and Mr. Mulder. Do you think you could talk to them?

(Teena nods and the social worker leaves the room.)

SCULLY: Hi. I know you must be feeling really sad right now. And scared. But we want to find out what happened so we can help stop whoever hurt your daddy. Okay?

(Teena nods.)

SCULLY: Okay. Did you ever see any strangers with your daddy at home?

(Teena shakes her head no.)

SCULLY: Did you ever see... anyone yell at your daddy or your daddy yell at them?

TEENA: No.

SCULLY: Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your daddy?

TEENA: No.

MULDER: Nice bunny, Teena. Can we talk about what happened that day? About what happened in the back yard?

(Teena nods hesitantly.)

MULDER: Yeah? Do you remember... any strange sounds or lights or anything like that?

TEENA: There was Red Lightening.

MULDER: Can you tell me more about the Red Lightening?

TEENA: I can't remember... it all went dark.

MULDER: Had you ever seen anything like that before?

(Teena nods.)

MULDER: Yeah? When?

TEENA: The men from the clouds, they were after my dad.

(Scully's phone rings. She answers it away from the bed and Mulder and Teena.)

SCULLY: Scully... Where?

MULDER: Why were these men after your Dad?

TEENA: They wanted to exsanguinate him.

(Mulder looks at Teena with surprise such a little girl would know such a word.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Mulder joins Scully.)

SCULLY: There's been another one.




SCENE 6
REARDON CRIME SCENE - MARIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA
In a back yard of a similar home as the Greenwich house, a back yard swing set is shown. Mulder and Scully walk in from the driveway. Scully is holding a file.

MULDER: It's like looking at a mirror image.

SCULLY: The victim, Doug Reardon, was married with one daughter. Cause of death, hypovilemia. Mulder, this is crazy. They also found traces of the poison digitalis.

MULDER: Puncture wounds?

SCULLY: Ah... yes. On the jugular. Time of death was estimated at 2:30 p.m. Same day, only three hours earlier than the Simmons murder.

MULDER: That's Pacific standard time. That makes it the exact same moment.

SCULLY: It appears we have two serial killers working in tandem.

MULDER: No. Serial killers seldom work in pairs. And when they do, they kill together not separately.

SCULLY: Mulder, nothing beyond your leading questions to Teena Simmons substantiates a UFO mutilation theory.

MULDER: Is Reardon's daughter nearby when he was murdered?

(She looks in the file again. )

SCULLY: Yes... The police report states that she remembers nothing. Ah... she's with her mother and family in Sacramento.

MULDER: When will they be back?

(She reads again.)

SCULLY: Tomorrow.

MULDER: Even money... she'll remember Red Lightening.




SCENE 7
FAIRFIELD COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES HOSTEL 12:35 AM E.S.T.
It is night. There is a storm outside. Lightening and thunder. Teena is in bed. She is holding her stuffed bunny. She lifts her head off the pillow. She looks at the window and gets out of bed. She checks through the window in the door if someone is in the hall. She pushes a chair in front of it. Someone on the other side of the door is trying to break in. Teena hides under the bed. Someone enters the room. Teena tries to make a break for it. A figure grabs her arm.




SCENE 8
HALLWAY
We hear Teena's scream. Thunder and lightening pounding. The social worker comes.

SOCIAL WORKER: Teena? Teena? Teena!

All that remains is Teena's stuffed bunny by the open window. Rain beating down on it.




SCENE 9
REARDON HOUSE - NEXT DAY
Mulder and Scully get out of the car and talk as they get to the house.

SCULLY: She was kidnaped from the Social Services Home around 11 p.m. last night. Looks like someone was afraid she might remember too much.

MULDER: Someone or something, Scully.

SCULLY: Connecticut State Troopers set up road blocks within a half an hour. Nothing.

MULDER: Maybe they weren't looking in the right direction. (He points up.)

SCULLY: I told them to contact us if they happen to find her.

(Mulder knocks on the door. It opens. Standing there is a little girl that looks exactly like Teena Simmons. Mulder and Scully just stare at her for a second.)

SCULLY: Teena?

CINDY: No.

SCULLY: What's your name?

CINDY: Cindy Reardon.

MULDER: You live here, Cindy?

CINDY: Ever since I was born, 8 years ago.




SCENE 10
REARDON HOUSE - LATER
Inside, Cindy is watching cartoons as Mulder and Scully watch her from a distance. Cindy picks up the remote and turns the channel to a news conference. She puts the remote down. She's interested. Scully looks at Mulder as Mrs. Reardon enters with a tray of tea.

MULDER: Cindy really is a beautiful little girl, Mrs. Reardon.

MRS REARDON: Doug and I wanted to spoil her. We wanted to protect her from everything horrible in the world. She was daddy's little girl.

(She starts to softly cry.)

MULDER: Is she an only child?

(Mrs. Reardon nods.)

SCULLY: May I ask... Was Cindy adopted?

MRS REARDON: No. I gave birth to her at San Rafael General.

(Cindy listens to what they are saying.)

SCULLY: So, I assume you have all the proper documentation. Birth certificate...

MRS REARDON: Of course I do.

MULDER: Was she the only child delivered at that birth?

MRS REARDON: What the hell kind of question is that? Look, I have told the police everything I know.

(Mulder shows Mrs. Reardon a picture of Teena and Mr. Simmons.)

MULDER: Mrs. Reardon, have you ever seen this man before?

MRS REARDON: This... is this your suspect?

MULDER: No.

MRS REARDON: Did he do something to Cindy?

MULDER: No... he... he did... he didn't...

SCULLY: No. Mrs. Reardon. This is not your daughter. That girl's name is Teena Simmons. She lives 3,000 miles away in Connecticut. That man, her father, was killed in the same manner as your husband.

MRS REARDON: Cindy is my daughter. I can show you videos of her birth. We tried for six years to become pregnant.

MULDER: In vitro fertilization?

(She nods.)

MULDER: At which clinic?

MRS REARDON: Luther Stapes Center. Down in San Francisco.

MULDER: Thanks.




SCENE 11
OUTSIDE
Scully and Mulder leave the house and talk on the way to the car.

SCULLY: Do you still believe this is UFO related? Cindy Reardon didn't see Red Lightening.

MULDER: I don't know. The only thing similar about these girls doesn't seem to be their appearance.

SCULLY: Well, there seems to be the random possibility that two people can have an unrelated likeness.

MULDER: Who both just happened to see their father's exsanguinated. I'd like to get the odds on that in Vegas.

(Scully seems to agree.)




SCENE 12
CAR
Mulder and Scully get in.

SCULLY: The girls are the one and only link between identical murders.

MULDER: One girl was just abducted.

SCULLY: Kidnaped.

MULDER: Potato, potahto.

(Mulder stops the car.)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: The murders were committed by the same person or persons. Part of the pattern involves kidnaping the daughter.

SCULLY: And you expect the pattern to continue.

MULDER: I'm going to keep an eye on the girl. You check out the clinic. See if the Simmons were enrolled in the same fertility program.

(He opens the door and gets out.)

SCULLY: Okay. I'll call the San Francisco bureau and get someone to relieve you.

MULDER: Okay.

(He shuts the door.)




SCENE 13
LUTHER STAPES CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE
A doctor and Scully walk up the stairs and talk.

DOCTOR: In vitro fertilization is a procedure in which we can implement fertilization. An implantation of the embryo to the uterus.

SCULLY: Could a patient have believed she was receiving her own eggs but actually receive another without her knowledge?

DOCTOR: Not here. We have very strict controls.

SCULLY: Are you ever aware of having patients by the name of Claudia and Joel Simmons?

DOCTOR: Any information about patients is confidential. That's our policy.

SCULLY: Both the Simmons are dead. And their daughter has been kidnaped. I think any information that you have that could help overrides your policy.




SCENE 14
DOCTOR'S OFFICE
Scully is looking at a file and reads.

SCULLY: You have copies of their records sent to Greenwich, CT, in 1991... They came here 9 years ago under the supervision of a Dr. Sally Kendrick?

(No answer.)

SCULLY: There a problem?

DOCTOR: Dr. Kendrick was nothing but a problem.

(They watch a video tape of Sally Kendrick giving a lecture. She is sharp looking and professional. Wearing a lab coat and in an office. She smiles as she talks.)

SALLY KENDRICK ON TAPE: Hello. And welcome to the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine. (She sits on the desk.) I'm Dr. Sally Kendrick, a specialist in the exciting field of in vitro fertilization.

DOCTOR: She was a resident here in 1985. Brilliant. First in her class at Yale med where she got her MD. After completing her doctorate in Bio Genetics, we were thrilled to get her.

SCULLY: And now you don't sound too thrilled.

DOCTOR: We have reason to believe that Dr. Kendrick was tampering with genetic material that was fertilized in the lab prior to implant. Experimenting with Eugenics.

SCULLY: Did you report this to the AMA?

DOCTOR: Of course. And I fired her. And also requested an investigation with the Health Department.

SCULLY: And what happened?

DOCTOR: The AMA censured her. My request for an investigation was denied. Dr. Kendrick disappeared.

DR KENDRICK ON TAPE: We know the pain of infertility and we are ready to help. In the next half hour, I'll guide you through...

(We watch the tape again as it melds into another TV and VCR showing the same tape with Scully's voice over.)




SCENE 15
HOTEL ROOM
Mulder and Scully are sitting on the end of a bed watching the tape. Scully talks over the tape.

SCULLY: Dr. Kendrick was the supervising physician in both the Reardon's and Simmons' IVF program. It seems she was experimenting at the clinic.

MULDER: Maybe now she's trying to erase the results?

(They watch the tape again.)

DR KENDRICK ON TAPE: ... can't guarantee everyone's success, but with our scientific advances, a little luck, and a lot of hope... miracles can happen.

SCULLY: Well, she must have had an accomplice to have done both murders.

MULDER: So you think this is a vendetta that she and a colleague have against the Stapes Center?

(The phone rings. Scully answers it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, does this mean you've abandoned your UFO connection? (to phone) Hello?

(There's two clicks on the phone. )

SCULLY: Hello?

(She hangs up.)

SCULLY: Just a couple of clicks. Must be the wrong number.

MULDER: I'll tell you what... I'm going to sleep on it and we'll talk about it in the morning.

(He guides her to the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you're rushing me out of the room.

MULDER: No, I'm not.

SCULLY: You got a girl coming over?

MULDER: What's a girl?

(He opens the door.)

MULDER: No, I have... there's a movie I want to watch on TV. Sleep tight. See you in the morning.




SCENE 16
PIER
Mulder waits and looks around. He walks by bushes and hears Deep Throat's voice. He stops.

DEEP THROAT: Are you certain she hasn't followed you?

MULDER: Yes. What are you doing here?

(Deep Throat comes out of the bushes and they walk as they talk.)

DEEP THROAT: I was hoping we could take in a Warriors game. Actually I was just in the neighborhood... Wondered if I ever told you about the Lichfield Experiments.

MULDER: No you haven't.

DEEP THROAT: Well, it was the most interesting project. Highest level of classification. All records have since been destroyed. And those who knew of it, denied knowledge of its existence. It existed during the height of the cold war. We got wind the Russians were fooling around with Eugenics. Rather primitively, I might add. Trying to crossbreed top scientists, athletes... to come up with the superior soldier. Naturally, we jumped on the band wagon.




SCENE 17
WHITING INSTITUTE FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
Deep Throat's voice over continues as we see the outside of the institute that looks like a prison.

MULDER VOICE OVER: The Lichfield Experiment.

DEEP THROAT VOICE OVER: A group of genetically controlled children. Raised and monitored on a compound in Lichfield. The boys were called Adam and the girls were called Eve. There's a woman you should see and I'll make sure that you can get in.




SCENE 18
INSIDE
Scully and Mulder go to a desk to sign in by a guard.

MULDER: Agents Mulder and Scully. We're here to see Eve 6.

GUARD: Deposit your fire arms.

(They do.)

GUARD: Sign for these.

(He puts two contraptions on the desk.)

MULDER: What are those?

GUARD: Panic buttons. Can't let you inside without one.




SCENE 19
LATER
They are being led through a series of corridors, stairs and cages. All metal and mesh. They stop by a cell door. The female security guard gives them both flashlights.

SCULLY: Why the flashlights?

GUARD: She screams and screams if we turn the over heads on. No one's ever gotten a good look at her.

(Mulder and Scully are going to go into the cell.)

GUARD: We'll be right outside.




SCENE 20
INSIDE CELL
Mulder and Scully turn the flashlights on. It's a dirty cell with garbage all over. Padded walls.

MULDER: Hello? (They see Eve 6 crouching in the corner on the floor with shackles. Eve 6 has dirty hair and yellow teeth. There are pictures on the wall.)

EVE 6: Well it looks like you got what you're looking for... One of us at least.

SCULLY: Sally Kendrick...

EVE 6: Cut off the chains... then we'll talk.

MULDER: They're probably there for a good reason.

EVE 6: No. Bad reason. I paid too much attention to a guard. Bit into his eyeball. (She giggles and makes gnashing sounds.) I meant it as a sign of affection. (She laughs.) Are you going to give me an IQ test by any chance? I think I can top 265. We're very bright, we Eves. It runs in the family.

MULDER: Where are the others? The other Adams and the Eves?

EVE 6: All that's left is me. And Eve 7, she escaped early on. And Eve 8. She escaped 10 years later.

SCULLY: Are you Sally Kendrick?

EVE 6: That's not my name. But she is me and I am her and we are together.

(She thinks this is funny too.)

SCULLY: Did you work for the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine in 1985?

EVE 6: 1985?! I've been tied up like this for two years and for what reason? For no reason, I did nothing. I'm just me. They made me. But did they suffer? No. No. I suffer. I suffer! They keep me alive for the Lichfield Project , they come in... they test me, they poke me... to see what went wrong. Sally knows what went wrong.

(She was almost spitting out the words. She points to them as best she can with her hands tied.)

EVE 6: You and you. You have 46 chromosomes. The Adams and the Eves ... we have 56. We have extra chromosomes. Number 4, 5, 12, 16, and 22. This replication of chromosomes also produces additional genes. Heightened strength. Heightened intelligence.

MULDER: Heightened psychosis.

EVE 6: Saved the best for last. (She looks at them.) You don't believe me. I have proof. Look on the wall. My family album.

(One of the pictures on the wall is of many clones of Teena and Cindy by a swing set.)

SCULLY: My God. It's the girls.

EVE 6: We were close. We were very close.

MULDER: Dr. Kendrick was using the clinic to carry on the Lichfield Experiment. She was cloning herself.




SCENE 21
REARDON HOUSE
There are religious picture on the wall as we hear Cindy's voice over reciting a prayer.

CINDY VOICE OVER: Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord, my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake... (She is bent by the bed and her mother is watching her while sitting on the bed.) I pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless Grandma and Grandpa Stenner, Erma and ___, and please bless Mom, and please take care of Daddy up in heaven.

MRS REARDON: You're such a special little girl, Cindy. (She tucks her into bed.) Good night, Honey.




SCENE 22
OUTSIDE HOUSE
The upstairs light is turned off.




SCENE 23
CAR
Mulder and Scully are in the car watching the house.

MULDER: Suppose Eve 6 is right and there are two other Eves out there. That could account for the two identical murders occurring at exactly the same time. Sally Kendrick does have an accomplice. Herself.

SCULLY: Until I heard that, I was beginning to suspect the girls.

MULDER: No. No, no, no. It seems the two remaining Eves are doing away with the parents in order to keep Teena and Cindy in the family.




SCENE 24
CINDY'S ROOM
The lights are off and Cindy gets out of bed.




SCENE 25
CAR
Scully looks at Cindy's window with binoculars. Cindy is standing at the window.

SCULLY: You suppose these girls have any idea of what they are?

MULDER: I hope not.

(A bright light appears in Cindy's room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, let's go.




SCENE 26
CINDY'S ROOM
The closet fills with light and the doors open. Light floods the room. Cindy turns around and someone comes out of the closet and takes Cindy's arm.




SCENE 27
CAR
Mulder and Scully get out of the car.

MULDER: I'll take the back.

(They take off in different directions.)




SCENE 28
OUTSIDE HOUSE
Mulder goes around the side of the house on the driveway with his flashlight and gun.




SCENE 29
INSIDE HOUSE
The lights are off and Scully walks through the house with her gun poised. She meets up with Mrs. Reardon.

SCULLY: There's someone upstairs, wait outside.




SCENE 30
OUTSIDE HOUSE
Mulder comes around to the back yard.




SCENE 31
INSIDE HOUSE
Scully gets to the top of the stairs and is blind sided. She is knocked down by a force.




SCENE 32
OUTSIDE HOUSE
The patio door bursts and a woman holding Cindy comes out of the house. Mulder points his gun.

MULDER: FBI. I'm armed.

((I'm not sure if this is the real Sally Kendrick who is Eve 7 or this is just Eve 7 or what, but I'll call this one Eve 7.)) Eve 7 holding Cindy stops and looks at him. She's wearing a dark sweatshirt with the hood over her head.

MULDER: Which one are you? Eve 7 or Eve 8?

(Eve 7 points a gun at Cindy's head.)

EVE 7: Drop it. You know I'm capable. Slow. Real slow.

(Mulder puts his gun on the ground. Eve 7 takes off and Mulder stoops to pick up his gun and follows her. A car starts and he runs after it as it takes off down the alleyway.)




SCENE 33
LATER
Scully is talking to a cop filling out a report.

SCULLY: Suspect's name is Sally Kendrick. Early 40's, 5'8, 135 pounds. Now she may have an accomplice, similar in appearance. Kendrick is driving a light blue '93 Corolla. She has exceptional strength for her size. So you must consider her armed and dangerous. Quite possibly she'll display severe psychotic behavior. The Oakland Bureau was here to orchestrate a search across the bridge.

(She leaves the cop and joins Mrs. Reardon wrapped in a blanket and Mulder.)

MRS REARDON: What if she kills her?

MULDER: Mrs. Reardon, the fact that Kendrick and her accomplice murdered the fathers and abducted the girls means they want them alive. I'm sure Cindy's alive and we'll find her.

(Mrs. Reardon walks away crying.)

SCULLY: And then what do we do?




SCENE 34
PT. REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE - 40 MILES NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO
A vacancy sign is lit with a car driving up to the hotel. The manager does gardening and watches as the car parks and a woman, an Eve gets out and walks into a hotel kitchenette with the girl.




SCENE 35
INSIDE
They enter.

EVE 7: I'm sorry you have to meet this way. But it's the best for all concerned.

(Eve 7 opens the bathroom door. Teena is sitting on the edge of the tub. Cindy hangs by the door. Eve 7 sits on the tub with Teena.)

EVE 7: Teena Simmons, meet Cindy Reardon.

(They look each other over and smile.)




SCENE 36
REARDON HOUSE
Scully and Mulder come downstairs. A female cop meets them. Mulder is on his cell phone.

COP: Agent Scully? They found the Corolla in the parking lot at San Francisco International.

SCULLY: Okay, good. I want you to start a check on every single passenger for every flight that left the terminal over the past twelve hours. I want you to check every single terminal to make sure she's not hiding out somewhere for a later flight. And remember, she may have an accomplice.

(Mulder hangs up.)

MULDER: That was a motel manager in Port Reyes that says he's got a guest that matches Sally Kendrick's description.

SCULLY: We just found the car at the airport.

MULDER: She might have ditched it. The manager said this woman checked in with a little girl. That she leaves the hotel in the afternoon by herself, was gone all night and returns the next day with the little girl.

SCULLY: Someone else could have picked up the little girl without the manager knowing about it. The place is crawling with vacationing families. There would be hundreds of little kids running around.

MULDER: No, he remembers this kid. She told him he should use chlorine to irradiate the dinoflagellates in the swimming pool. Does that sound like someone we know?

SCULLY: That's it.




SCENE 37
HOTEL
Sally prepares fast food for them and sits at the table with the girls.

EVE 7: I've always kept and close eye on your behavior. No matter where I was. The last few years I've spent in search of the remaining Eves. That however was cut short by your... activity. I hoped my work at the Stapes Center had corrected the Lichfield flaws. Psychotic behavior didn't develop in the Adams and Eves until age 16. Homicidal behavior... at 20. Imagine my... disappointment when I learned of your... accelerated development. How did you know of each other's existence?

TEENA AND CINDY: We just knew.

EVE 7: Did you discuss how you would orchestrate your little... prank?

TEENA AND CINDY: We just knew.

EVE 7: Why murder your fathers?

TEENA OR CINDY (who knows which is which): They weren't our fathers.

THE OTHER ONE: We have no parents.

THE FIRST ONE: We weren't born.

THE OTHER ONE: We were created.

EVE 7: You cannot think that way. You're human beings. Different, special, but you cannot give into genetic destiny. That's why I've taken you. I was raised by a man who knew what I was. He was a genetic engineer on the project. With the... proper environment, and a program... of long term medication... you can become like me... and not the other Eves...

(She is breathing heavy. Sally starts shaking the table. The girls smile at each other. She gets up and is about the throw up.)

EVE 7: What... what have you done to ... me?

TEENA OR CINDY: Your soda...

THE OTHER ONE: 4 ounces of foxglove...

THE FIRST ONE: ...extracted from the digitalis plant...

(The other one makes a measurement of about a half inch between her pointing finger and thumb.)

THE OTHER ONE: This much is a lethal dose.

THE FIRST ONE: We cultivated it ourselves.

EVE 7: Wh... why?

TEENA OR CINDY: You tell us.

THE OTHER ONE: You made us.

THE FIRST ONE: We're your mistake.

(Eve tries to get a grip by the counter. )

EVE 7: That I'll correct... my mistake.




SCENE 38
LATER
Mulder and Scully arrive. Cops are already there. He's in the front seat of his prowler. Mulder and Scully walk to him and he gets out.

COP: I waited like you told me. No one's gotten out and no one's gotten in.

(They hear a noise.)

COP: Get the back!

(They all rush to the hotel room.)




SCENE 39
INSIDE
They enter and see Eve on the floor. Mulder looks both ways out the open window as Scully checks for a pulse.

TEENA OR CINDY: They left.

(Scully sees the girls huddled in a corner.)

SCULLY: Who's they?

OTHER ONE: Her and another lady.

FIRST ONE: We were all supposed to drink but we only pretended to drink it.

OTHER ONE: They tried to poison us.

(The girls hug, scared.)

MULDER: What did the other lady look like?

(They point at the dead Eve 7 on the floor.)

MULDER: Eve 8. They were working together.

SCULLY: It's alright. We'll take care of you. You're safe with us.




SCENE 40
LATER
A sheet is put over Sally. Scully picks up a glass from the table. She looks at it and hands it to Mulder.

SCULLY: Looks like the Eves mixed about 4 ounces of digitalis in each glass.

MULDER: Their own mini Jonestown. Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide.

SCULLY: It has a sweet flavor. It's probably not even perceptible in soda.

(A cop comes up to them.)

COP: We're still searching the area but still no sign of the other suspect. We'll have an officer take the girls back.

MULDER: Ah, maybe it would be better if we took responsibility for the girls.

SCULLY: We could take them to get checked out by a doctor.

COP: Okay, whatever.




SCENE 41
OUTSIDE
Scully walks to the girls.

SCULLY: We're going to take you back.

CINDY: Back where? What's going to happen to Teena?

(They get in the back seat.)

SCULLY: They've already grown so attached. It's going to be hard when Teena gets placed in foster care.

MULDER: Yeah.

(Mulder and Scully get in.)




SCENE 42
ROAD - NIGHT
Mulder is driving. Scully in front passenger seat and the girls in the back. They look at each other.

TEENA OR CINDY: Agent Mulder, I have to go to the bathroom.

OTHER ONE: Me too.

MULDER: Can you hold it?

FIRST ONE: I really need to go.

SCULLY: I could use some caffeine.




SCENE 43
TRUCK STOP
They drive up.




SCENE 44
INSIDE
They walk up to the counter. There's a waitress behind the counter.

MULDER: Hi. Where's your bathrooms?

WAITRESS: In the back. Let me get you the key.

(She hands them to him.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(He gives the woman's key to Scully and turns back to the counter.)

MULDER: Oh, can I get four diet sodas?

TEENA AND CINDY: Regular.

MULDER: Okay, two diet and two regular. To go. Please.

(Scully and the girls go to the woman's restroom.)




SCENE 45
WOMAN'S RESTROOM
We see the closed stall doors.

TEENA OR CINDY VOICE OVER: Agent Scully, my door's stuck.

SCULLY VOICE OVER: Just a second.

(One of the girls leaves.)




SCENE 46
COUNTER
The girl goes to the counter and takes two of the drinks. The waitress stops her.

WAITRESS: Just a minute.

TEENA OR CINDY: That's okay. My dad will pay for them when he gets out of the bathroom.

(She brings the drinks to a table and puts poison in them. Mulder comes up behind her.)

MULDER: Those are the diet?

(She points to two drinks.)

TEENA OR CINDY: I think these are.

(He takes a drink.)

MULDER: Are you sure? These are really sweet.

TEENA OR CINDY: I know they are. I saw her pour it.

MULDER: Okay.

(Scully and the other girl comes out.)

SCULLY: Let's go.

MULDER: Come on.

(He gives his drink to Scully and puts his hand on the back of the girl and they walk to the door. Scully and the other girl go outside.)

TEENA OR CINDY: Don't forget the drinks.

(Mulder and the girl come back to counter to pay for them.)

MULDER: How much?

WAITRESS: $5.

(Mulder gives money to the girl.)

MULDER: You want to pay?

TEENA OR CINDY: Sure.

MULDER: Thanks.

(He says to the waitress and they walk to the door.)




SCENE 47
OUTSIDE
They all walk outside. Scully takes a drink.

SCULLY: Um, tastes syrupy.

(Mulder pats his pockets.)

MULDER: You didn't pick up my keys off the counter, did you?

(She shakes her head.)

MULDER: All right. I'll be right back.

(Scully smiles and she and the girls walk to the car. Mulder goes back inside. )




SCENE 48
INSIDE
Mulder sees a green residue on the table where the drinks were.




SCENE 49
OUTSIDE
Mulder bursts out of the truck stop as Scully takes another drink.

MULDER: SCULLY!

SCULLY: What?

(He rushes down the stairs to her.)

MULDER: I just wanted to open the car door for you.

(He knocks the drink out of her hand.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER (to Scully, quietly so the girls won't hear): It's them, they poisoned them, let's just get them into the car.

(The girls are gone.)

MULDER: I only had a sip.

SCULLY: We didn't drink enough to make us sick.

(They look around for them. Guns raised. Neat shots through pipes as Scully passes, etc. Teena and Cindy walk under a semi bed and Mulder grabs them. They scream.)

MULDER: SCULLY! I GOT THEM!

TEENA AND CINDY: LEAVE US ALONE!

MULDER: SCULLY!

(A truck driver comes with a shotgun and his wife.)

TRUCK DRIVER: HEY! What the hell are you doing?

(Scully runs up.)

MULDER: Back off. We're federal agents.

TRUCK DRIVER: Yeah, and these are America's Most Wanted? Hands in front.

TEENA AND CINDY: LEAVE US ALONE!

TRUCK DRIVER'S WIFE: Get in the truck, girls.

(The girls get out of Mulder's clench.)

TRUCK DRIVER'S WIFE: Get in. I'm going to call the police.

SCULLY: We are the police.

(The girls take off.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(They search for them again. A bus leaves.)

TRUCK DRIVER: They went that way.

(He points to the truck stop. They go into the truck stop again.)




SCENE 50
TRUCK STOP
Mulder and Scully run in. They see the waitress.

SCULLY: Did you see the twins we were with?

WAITRESS: No. There's a bunch of school kids just left in that bus.




SCENE 51
OUTSIDE
Mulder and Scully go outside and into their car. It drives behind a truck, pauses, then takes off after the bus. Teena and Cindy get out of a boat with a tarp on it. Mulder comes up behind them.

MULDER: Forget your sodas?

TEENA: We didn't do anything wrong.

CINDY: We're just little girls.

MULDER: That's the last thing you are.




SCENE 52
REARDON HOUSE
She is looking at pictures of Cindy.

MRS REARDON: They said they have an excellent program that can help her.

MULDER: They can't hide behind the bureaucracy, Mrs. Reardon. You have every right to know what happened. You have a right to know about your daughter.

MRS REARDON: All I need to know is she was not my daughter. She never was.




SCENE 53
CELLS
In adjoining cells, Teena and Cindy are next to Eve 6. They look at her. They are now labeled Eves 9 and 10.

EVE 6: Hello girls. So nice to have company.




SCENE 54
GUARD STATION
A woman in a white lab coat is signing in. He gives her a panic button.

GUARD: Sign for this.
(She does.)




SCENE 55
CELLS
The lab coated woman goes to the cell doors.

EVE 9: Hello Eve 8.

EVE 8: How did you know I'd come for you?

EVE 10: We've been waiting.

EVE 8: How did you know I'd come for you?

EVE 9: We just knew.

EVE 10: We just knew.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
BOSHAM, ENGLAND
70 MILES SOUTHWEST OF LONDON
(A man goes out of his house, holding hands with his young wife as gardeners shuffle around)

MAN: Hmm, yes.

(He kisses her.)

Love you.

(He walks down the walkway with his cane, looking at the various gardeners.)

Hello.

GARDENER: Good morning, sir.

MAN: Good morning.

(He goes over to a man, Cecil L'Ively, trimming the flower bushes.)

Good morning, Cecil.

L'IVELY: Top of the morning to you

(The man walks to his car. The chauffeur opens the door and the man turns and waves goodbye. Cecil watches intently.)

Eh, thank you. Goodbye, darling.

WOMAN: Goodbye, Charles. When can I expect you?

MAN: Before supper.

(He looks at his arm. It is on fire. The woman gasps as he begins spinning around, screaming. The men start running towards him, all except Cecil. The man is completely engulfed in flames now, and he spins around before falling, screaming horrifically. The men scream various commands to each other as they run over to try to put out the fire. Cecil watches the fire dance, a smile on his face.)




SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder and Scully walk to their car. Mulder is carrying a stack of books.)

SCULLY: I forgot what it was like to spend a day in court.

MULDER: Well, that's one of the luxuries of hunting down aliens and genetic mutants. You rarely get to press charges.

(He puts the books on the top of the car and reaches into his pocket to take out the keys. Scully laughs and opens the door.)

SCULLY: It's open.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: It's unlocked.

MULDER: That's weird. I'm sure I locked it.

SCULLY: Must be an X-File.

(She gets in the car. He smiles, takes the books and gets in the car.)

What's that?

(Mulder looks to see a cassette sitting on the dashboard.)

MULDER: I told you I locked the door.

(He takes the tape out of it's case and looks at it.)

SCULLY: What do you think it is?

MULDER: Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it.

(He puts the tape in and it plays. A woman with a British accent speaks.)

WOMAN: Greetings, Agent Mulder. Six months ago, British Minister of Parliament Reggie Ellicott received an audio cassette much like the one you are listening to now.

(Mulder recognizes the voice and starts looking around.)

Unfortunately for Mr. Ellicott, when he popped the tape into the car stereo, he armed a device, which, when he tried to exit the car, created an explosion that was heard five miles away. The Scotland Yard Forensic Team could only identify the poor bastard by his dental records. If only he hadn't reached for the door handle and triggered the detonator. But then how was he to know he was sitting on enough plastique explosive to lift the car forty feet in the air and deposit the engine block on top of a three-story building?

(The door opens and Scully gasps. A woman, Phoebe Green, looks in. She was the woman on the tape.)

GREEN: Aren't we looking rather ghostly?

MULDER: (to Scully) It's an old friend.

(He gets out of the car.)

GREEN: Aren't you going to thank me?

MULDER: For what?

GREEN: Saving your life. One tends not to make the same mistake twice.

MULDER: I'll try to remember that.

GREEN: Oh, come on, don't tell me you left your sense of humor in Oxford ten years ago?

MULDER: No, actually. It's one of the few things you didn't drive a stake through.

(Scully gets out of the car and looks at them. Green kisses Mulder. Scully seems uncomfortable with that.)

GREEN: You know, some mistakes are quite worth making twice.

MULDER: Dana Scully, this is Phoebe Green, terror of Scotland Yard.

GREEN: Hello.

SCULLY: Hello.

GREEN (whispering): She hates me.

MULDER: What brings you to the colonies?




SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(Mulder is sitting down and looking at pictures of severely charred men. Phoebe is sitting across from him, Scully is standing.)

GREEN: Some clever bloke has been giving the aristocracy a good scare. Killed off a ranking member of Parliament or three for good measure. Set Windsor Castle ablaze in 1992.

MULDER: Your car bomber?

GREEN: No. This one likes to burn his victims alive. Can't figure out how he does it either. Not a crumb of evidence left at the crime scene. The last one died in his front garden, his poor young wife watching helplessly as he went up in smoke.

MULDER: The Irish Republican Army?

GREEN: Our suspect likes to send love letters to his victims' wives.

(She stands up.)

Sent one to the wife of Sir Malcolm Marsden a month ago. Three days later, he narrowly escaped a fire in his garage. Burned to the ground. So they're renting a place out on Cape Cod. Bringing the family over to the states for an extended holiday or until we can catch the dirty bugger.

MULDER: You think he's that determined?

GREEN: Judging by his success, he seems to take a certain delight in his work.

MULDER: So what brings you on this detour to Washington, D.C., Inspector?

GREEN: I figured my friend Mulder couldn't resist a three-pipe problem.

MULDER: I'll run it by our arson specialist.

GREEN: Splendid. I'll call London, let them know.

(Mulder nods. Green walks over to the chair, takes her coat and bag, and opens the door. She turns back and looks at Scully.)

Oh, goodbye.

(Scully waves goodbye. Phoebe leaves.)

SCULLY: Three-pipe problem?

MULDER: That's, uh, from Sherlock Holmes. It's a private joke.

SCULLY: How private?

MULDER: Um... we knew each other in school in England. She was brilliant and, uh, I got in over my head and, uh, paid the price.

SCULLY: Mulder, you just keep unfolding like a flower.

(She gets up, as does he. He puts on his coat.)

MULDER: That was over ten years ago, Scully.

SCULLY: Yeah, I noticed how you couldn't drop everything fast enough in order to help her out.

MULDER: Oh, I was merely extending her a professional courtesy.

SCULLY: Oh, is that what you were extending?

MULDER: Look, I'm going to run this by the arson guys and then she's on her own.

SCULLY: Something tells me you're not going to get rid of her that easily.

(He opens the door and looks at her, then walks out.)




SCENE 4
ARSON LAB
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(Mulder is sitting in the back. Phoebe is holding a remote control. On the slide viewscreen, there is a picture of fire. Agent Beatty, the arson specialist, stands in front of it.)

BEATTY: Beautiful.

(The slide changes to more flames.)

BEATTY: Oh, just beautiful. Look at that. Salmon red flames. This is fourteen-hundred, fifteen-hundred degrees. This is a work of art.

(Slide changes to a burnt body.)

BEATTY: Was there any kind incendiary device used?

GREEN: Yes, actually. The victim's body.

BEATTY: Spontaneous combustion?

GREEN: He was murdered. However, we've turned up no evidence that tells us how the body caught fire.

(The slides go off.)

BEATTY: Well, that's peculiar. People don't normally just catch on fire.

(Scully takes a peek in. The specialist starts around the desk to Phoebe.)

BEATTY: I mean, we burn, but we don't conduct all that well. There's usually some kind of extraneous fuel involved like candle wax, gasoline, something flammable and incendiary that adheres to the skin.

GREEN: Like an accelerant.

BEATTY: Like an accelerant, yes.

GREEN: But we found no trace of anything, save for a dusting of magnesium at two of the sites.

BEATTY: That's aliphatic pyrolysis. It's a residue remaining after an exothermic reaction.

GREEN: But there's no evidence of the source, no pour patterns or ignition devices.

BEATTY: There have been some arson fires in Seattle lately and, uh, Pennsylvania that burn so hot that the firemen can't put them out. 7,000 degrees. I mean, hosing that down just makes it worse.

MULDER: How's that?

BEATTY: Uh, the, uh, reaction is so intense that it splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen. Just adds fuel to the fire.

GREEN: What were they using?

BEATTY: We don't know for sure. Could be rocket fuel. That stuff burns so hot and clean, there's never any trace left. You see, it's very difficult to prove arson. It's driving the insurance companies nuts.

(He and Phoebe laugh.)

BEATTY: Well, that's about the only explanation that I can give you.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: But there have been cases of pyrokinetics, people who can control and conduct fire.

BEATTY: Well, I've seen fire bend around corners, seen it bounce like a rubber ball. Fire's got a certain genius, you know? A certain demon poetry. It's like it's got a mind of it's own. But I've never seen one that can defy the laws of physics, not when you figure it out. You've, uh...

(He looks at Phoebe.)

BEATTY: You've got quite a case for yourself here, Mulder. I almost wish I could be in your shoes.

(Mulder and Green look at each other.)




SCENE 5
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS
(Cecil L'Ively is dressed as a handyman, painting the walls with argotypoline, a kind of rocket fuel. He looks through the window and sees a towncar drive up, followed by a rental truck. The door opens and a dog runs out, followed by two boys, Jimmie and Michael.)

JIMMIE: Hey, Jackson... boy, that's a nice house.

LADY MARSDEN: Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

L'IVELY: Welcome to America, Sir Malcolm.

(Sir Malcolm Marsden gets out of the car and goes to the other three. They talk to each other, but we can't understand it. L'Ively pulls out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. It lights by itself. He takes a few puffs. Some men walk in with boxes, led by Sir and Lady Marsden.)

MOVER: Where would you like these boxes?

LADY MARSDEN: Right there.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Over there, please, thank you.

LADY MARSDEN: And over there, as well. But the second one I want upstairs.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Gentlemen, the second set of boxes will go directly upstairs.

LADY MARSDEN: All right?

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Thank you very much.

(L'Ively starts down the stairs, carrying paint cans. He stops at the couple, who are standing on the stairs.)

L'IVELY: (with American accent) Hello there.

LADY MARSDEN: Hello.

L'IVELY: I'm Bob the caretaker. We've been exchanging letters?

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Oh, good heavens, yes of course, Bob. How are you?

(They shake hands.)

L'IVELY: Pleased to meet you.

(He shakes hands with her as well.)

LADY MARSDEN: Hi.

L'IVELY: Hi. Just trying to spruce the place up for you.

LADY MARSDEN: Well, it's delightful. The photos don't do it justice.

L'IVELY: Anything I can do for you, anything at all, you just holler.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Thank you, Bob.

LADY MARSDEN: Thanks.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Thank you very much.

(L'Ively walks down the stairs past them as they start up.)

Seems like a rather nice fellow, don't you think?

LADY MARSDEN: Very.

(They walk up the stairs and see a painting. It is of Lady Marsden.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: My God, darling. That painting rather looks like you. What do you think?

LADY MARSDEN: Oh, I don't know.

(Outside, the boys are playing soccer. Cecil walks out and looks at them.)

JIMMIE: I've never been good at this.

(Cecil smiles and hears the dog whimpering. He looks over at the dog, who is digging up something a little ways into the woods. He walks up and kicks the dog away. The dog starts barking at him.)

L'IVELY: Bloody little cur, I'll skin you alive.

(The dog whimpers and backs away. Cecil and the dog look at the ground. A hand is sticking out.)

See? I'm the caretaker now.




SCENE 6
X-FILES OFFICE
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(Mulder walks in and sees Scully sitting at the desk, reading a file.)

SCULLY: So, Sherlock, is the game afoot?

MULDER: I'm afraid so, Watson. But you're off the hook on this one.

(He closes the door. She takes off her glasses.)

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: I mean I'm not going to put you through this.

(He pulls a file out of the file cabinet and walks over to her.)

SCULLY: Put me through what?

MULDER: Phoebe's little mindgame.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: There's something else I haven't told you about myself, Scully.

(He sighs, kneels down and starts digging through the bottom drawer of another file cabinet.)

I hate fire. Hate it. Scared to death of it.

(He sighs again.)

When I was a kid, my best friend's house burned down. Had to spend the night in the rubble to keep away looters. For years, I had nightmares about being trapped in a burning building.

(He pulls out a file and stands up.)

SCULLY: Wait, and Phoebe knows about this?

MULDER: This is classic Phoebe Green. Mindgame player extraordinaire. Ten years it's taken me to forget about this woman, and she shows up in my life with a case like this.

SCULLY: So she shows up knowing the power she has over you and then she makes you walk through fire, is that it?

MULDER: Phoebe is fire.

SCULLY: Mulder? Are you sure you don't want me to help you out on this one?

MULDER: Sooner or later, a man's got to face his demons.

(He walks out.)




SCENE 7
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS
(Lady Marsden lights the stove and fills the tea kettle with water. Outside, Cecil watches her through the window, breathing heavily. She takes two cups out and then goes to get the sugar. Cecil hears a coughing and looks over. He looks back at the window briefly, smiles, then walks back around the house to the garage, where the chauffeur is standing. The chauffeur is smoking and coughing harshly.)

L'IVELY: (with American accent) Hello. You're the Marsden's driver?

DRIVER: Who's that?

(They walk towards each other.)

L'IVELY: Bob. Caretaker.

(He smiles.)

DRIVER: Oh.

L'IVELY: Bum a smoke?

DRIVER: Yeah, sure.

(He hands "Bob" a cigarette, who promptly puts it behind his ear.)

L'IVELY: I'm going into town. Can I get you anything?

DRIVER: Yeah. (coughs) Some cough medicine if it's not a problem.

L'IVELY: Syrup or, uh... lozenges?

DRIVER: Syrup would be good.

(L'Ively smiles and starts walking.)

Can I give you some money?

(L'Ively makes a "forget-about-it" motion.)

I appreciate that.

(He coughs some more and throws the cigarette down.)




SCENE 8
HENNESEY'S BAR
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS
(L'Ively pulls up a seat at the bar, putting a paper bag down, presumably with cough syrup in it. People can be heard murmuring, talking and laughing in the background. Cecil nods to the barkeep.)

L'IVELY: Beer?

(The barkeep nods. The woman two seats down looks at him, then moves into the seat next to him, beer in hand.)

WOMAN: They don't let you bring your own around here.

(L'Ively looks at the paper bag.)

L'IVELY: Well, I guess they'll just have to make an exception, won't they?

(She laughs.)

WOMAN: Oh, you're English. God, I just love that accent.

(She takes out a cig and a lighter. L'Ively holds the hand with the lighter.)

L'IVELY: Allow me.

WOMAN: And a gentleman to boot.

(He holds up a finger and moves it to the left of her. Her eyes follow it. He smirks and the tip of his finger lights.)

Oh my God. Now that is a trick.

(She laughs and turns around.)

Hey guys, take a look at this!

(She turns back around and Cecil's whole arm is on fire.)

L'IVELY: Care for a light?

(She gets up. He slams his fist down onto the bar, and all the spilt alcohol catches on fire. People start screaming and running out as he watches the fire dance on his arm.)




SCENE 9
BOSTON MERCY HOSPITAL
(Mulder and Phoebe walk into the waiting room.)

MULDER: I pulled this report off the wire last night. Eyewitnesses are saying that a customer in the bar caught fire but they're still looking for a body.

GREEN: Any indication an accelerant was used?

(He goes to the desk and signs a clipboard.)

MULDER: The bar's across the street from the fire station. It burned to the ground before they had a chance to even respond. The fire marshall said it burned so hot, it turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake. This was a woman who was in the bar.

(He knocks on a door labeled 28E. They open the door and walk in. The woman from the bar is lying on the bed.)

Hello?

WOMAN: Hello.

MULDER: Miss Kotchek?

WOMAN: Yes?

MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder from the F.B.I. This is Inspector Green.

(He closes the door and sits down next to her. Phoebe walks around to the other side.)

GREEN: Can you tell us what happened in the bar last night?

WOMAN: There was this guy. I'd had a few drinks, so... he sat next to me and he did this thing. It was like a magic trick where he lit his finger on fire.

(Green looks at Mulder, who takes notes.)

Next thing, I turned around and he was up in flames.

GREEN: Can you describe him?

WOMAN: Good looking, I think. Brownish hair.

MULDER: Long hair, short hair?

WOMAN: I've already given the police the information.

MULDER: Do you think you could work with a composite artist and come up with a sketch for us?

WOMAN: I said I had a few drinks...

MULDER: Can I get your full name and address?

WOMAN: See...

(He looks at her.)

I live with someone. He thinks I was at school last night.

MULDER: That's no problem. You can come down to the field office and work with somebody there. I'll give you a minute to think about it, okay?

(She nods. She sighs as Mulder and Green walk out.)

GREEN: Deftly done, Agent Mulder. Casually disregard her indiscretion. A firm but polite manner until she accedes to cooperate.

MULDER: It's a technique I refined in my relationship with you.

(He writes on his pad. She looks down at the desk.)

GREEN: Oh. Yes, well, I see you haven't lost your sense of humor after all.

(He looks at her.)

MULDER: I'm sorry, that was a cheap shot. I don't want to dredge up the past. Let's just stick to the case.

GREEN: Let's.

(She takes the pad from him and walks away a little. He walks over to her.)

MULDER: Look, Phoebe, I...

GREEN: Unless I'm mistaken, ten years seems like sufficient time to have forgiven, if not forgotten, a few youthful indiscretions.

MULDER: I'm cursed with a photographic memory.

GREEN: And don't you tell me that you've forgotten a certain youthful indiscretion. Atop Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tombstone on a misty night in Windlesham.

(She smiles.)

MULDER: Like I said, just stick to the case.

GREEN: Well, it occurred to me that we're going to a lot of trouble to find a description of a man who, in all likelihood, as been burnt to a crisp.

MULDER: I would agree with you but they haven't found a body yet.

(He walks back into her room, followed by Green.)

So can we count on you?

WOMAN: Yeah, okay.

(Green hands Mulder a paper.)

I don't know if it matters but I remembered something else about the guy who caught fire. He had an English accent.

(The agents look at each other.)




SCENE 10
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS
(The driver walks out of the bathroom, coughing and hacking. L'Ively, who is folding the sheets, looks at him, smiling.)

L'IVELY: Having a rough time, eh?

DRIVER: Yeah...

(He walks out. L'Ively looks at the open bottle of Pembroke's cough syrup sitting on the dresser.)

L'IVELY: Maybe it's the cough syrup.




SCENE 11
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Scully sits at her desk, taking notes. She opens up a folder and looks at some pictures of some burnt bodies. She starts typing up her profile on her laptop. We hear her as a voice-over as she does.)

SCULLY: After reviewing the files of the Scotland Yard arson murders, two points remain unexplained. One is the use of an untraceable accelerant. The other involves the victims. Since they all burned in the presence of family members in safe surroundings, this indicates unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist.




SCENE 12
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS
("Bob" coats the swing with argotypoline as Jimmie and Michael run around the yard, laughing. Scully still speaks over the scene.)

SCULLY: The arsonist is most likely a male, less than twenty-five years of age. He will often act out of impulse, satisfying sexual urges or insecurities with destructive behavior, which compensates for his social inadequacies or maladjustment.

(L'Ively looks at the boys.)

L'IVELY: You boys want to see a magic trick?

JIMMIE: Okay!

(They run over to him.)

L'IVELY: What's your names?

MICHAEL: Michael and Jimmie.

L'IVELY: Doesn't he talk?

MICHAEL: Yes!

(The boys laugh, as well as L'Ively.)

What kind of a magic trick?

L'IVELY: Maybe I'd better not.

JIMMIE: Show us!

L'IVELY: Nah, you might tell your mom and dad.

MICHAEL: We won't tell.

L'IVELY: Really? Promise?

JIMMIE: We promise.

L'IVELY: Hope to die? Stick a needle in your eye?

(The boys laugh.)

Okay, boys. You've taken a solemn oath of trust that can't be broken. Except under penalty... of death.

(The boys laugh a little more. L'Ively takes out a cigarette.)

Watch...

(He holds it up, then sticks it in the other hand, which is a fist.

Is it in there?

JIMMIE: No!

(The boys laugh. L'Ively blows into his fist and opens it. The cigarette is gone.)

L'IVELY: Ah, you're too smart for me.

(He smiles.)

MICHAEL: Where did it go?

L'IVELY: Where did it go... where do you think it went, Jimmie?

JIMMIE: I don't know.

L'IVELY: Ah... I think I remember.

(He makes a fake surprised expression as he reaches over to his right ear with both hands.)

Ah... ah... ah... ha!

(He "pulls it out" of his ear. The cigarette is lit, and looks like it has been for a while. He puts it in his mouth and takes a puff.)

Ta-da!

(The boys laugh in amazement.)

MICHAEL: Do it again!

L'IVELY: You want me to do it again?

MICHAEL: Yes!

L'IVELY: Okay, we'll do it again.

(He takes it out of his mouth and exhales smoke.)




SCENE 13
ARSON LAB
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(Agent Beatty is sitting at his desk, circling parts of a picture on his desk. Scully knocks on his open door.)

SCULLY: Agent Beatty?

(He looks up.)

BEATTY: Yes?

SCULLY: I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. Can I... steal a minute of your time?

BEATTY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Come in, sit down, come here. I'm just working on this Mafia torch job here.

(Scully walks over as Beatty takes off his glasses.)

SCULLY: I'm... working with Agent Mulder.

BEATTY: Oh, yeah, wild case. So, what can I do for you?

SCULLY: You mentioned that the arsonist might be using some kind of rocket fuel as an accelerant.

BEATTY: Yeah, well, that's just speculation. It still doesn't explain how he sets bodies on fire.

SCULLY: What if he got some of this fuel into some... hand cream or, uh...

BEATTY: Well, you've got to understand. Even the smallest amounts of this stuff can produce temperatures over 5,000 degrees. But I suppose it's not impossible. Extremely diluted. But you'd still have to find a way to ignite it.




SCENE 14
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS
(L'Ively now has three cigarettes in his mouth. The middle one lights suddenly. The boys laugh and clap.)

JIMMIE: Wow! Isn't that a great trick?

L'IVELY: Now sit down.

(They sit down in front of him. He takes them out of his mouth.)

So... you guys ever smoked a cigarette?

MICHAEL: No, they're bad for you.

L'IVELY: Would you like to take a puff, Michael?

MICHAEL: No.

L'IVELY: Make a man out of you.

MICHAEL: I don't want to.

L'IVELY: Why don't you hold one for me?

(He holds out his hands. In front of Michael's face is two cigarettes, one between his index and middle, the other between his middle and ring fingers.)

How about you, Jimmie?

(He moves his hand in front of Jimmie's face.)

Huh, little man?

(He holds up the other cigarette. They stare at each other, L'Ively smiling. Jimmie goes to take the cigarette when his mother appears at the top of the hill.)

LADY MARSDEN: Jimmie! Michael!

(They run to her. L'Ively puts his cigarettes away.)

Hello. Hi, Bob.

(She waves. He stands.)

There you are. We've had a bit of bad news.

(She starts walking towards him, a child under each arm.)

Our driver has taken ill and we're due at a party in Boston this evening. Is there any chance that we can impose upon you to drive the family into town? We'd be more than happy to pay you for your time and certainly to put you out for the night.

(L'Ively shakes his head, smiling.)

L'IVELY: I'd be very happy to do it as a favor.

LADY MARSDEN: Well, good. Thank you. All right then, boys, let's go, Daddy's got lunch all ready.

(As they walk away, Cecil's face becomes grim. Scully's voice comes over as he watches Lady Marsden walk away.)

SCULLY: The arsonist is usually unmarried and prone to excessive fantasies about women or men who are inaccessible to him. Often, the setting of fires results from his cowardice and inability to develop a natural relationship.




SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(Cut to Scully, typing at her laptop.)

SCULLY: His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned. The suspicious nature of the fire last night strongly suggests the arsonist has followed Lord Marsden to the United States. A check of all recent immigrations in the northeastern area is underway. It has become not a matter of if, but when he will strike.

(A man walks in behind her and hands her a paper.)

MAN: Here's that immigration data you wanted.

SCULLY: Thank you.

MAN: You're welcome.

(He leaves.)




SCENE 16
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
(Mulder and Green walk down a street, carrying umbrellas. It is raining.)

MULDER: Remember those reports I told you about, about people who could control and conduct fire, pyrokinetic?

GREEN: Faintly...

MULDER: I think this guy just sent us a message that he's far more exotic.

GREEN: I'd say so, I mean, he can set himself afire.

(Mulder laughs.)

What?

MULDER: I'm just not used to someone so quick to agree with me.

GREEN: Oh.

MULDER: What kind of protection does the family have?

GREEN: The driver's a very capable bodyguard.

MULDER: Well, he should look into getting a few additional men and limit public exposure.

(They reach their car.)

GREEN: Oh, they've got a party being held in their honor tonight in Boston. They're going to have to cancel.

MULDER: Unless you wanted to set a trap.

GREEN: I had thought of that. But we must be careful and discreet. The party's at 8:00 at the Venerable Plaza. I'll be traveling with the family so why don't you go on ahead and have a look around?

(Mulder nods and unlocks the door.)

Oh, and I've taken a room at the hotel for the night.

(He looks at her and sighs. She smirks and gets in the car as he folds up his umbrella.)




SCENE 17
VENABLE PLAZA HOTEL
5:16 P.M.
(A bellhop leads Mulder into his room, putting his bag down on the floor and his key on the dresser.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(He takes out a roll of bills and hands one to the bellhop. The bellhop nods.)

All right, thank you.

(The bellhop leaves. Mulder looks around the huge room, then puts his suitcase down on the bed. He sits down.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully's office. She's sitting at her desk, her computer on.)

SCULLY: It's Scully, where are you?

(Cut to hotel. Mulder stands.)

MULDER: I'm in Boston.

SCULLY: There's something I need to show you.

(Cut back to her office.)

I'm going to come up there.

(Cut to hotel.)

MULDER: What have you got?

SCULLY: I might have some information...

(Cut to her office.)

...on the identity of your arson suspect.

(Cut to the hotel. Mulder sighs and sits down on the bed. Cut to her office.)

You there, Mulder?

(Cut to the hotel.)

MULDER: Yeah, yeah...

(Cut to her office.)

SCULLY: Can I meet you somewhere?

(Back to the hotel.)

MULDER: No, it's just that I'm, I'm kind of anticipating having my hands full.

(Cut to Scully, who looks dismayed.)




SCENE 18
6:47 P.M.
(A limousine pulls up and a bellhop opens the door. The Marsdens get out. He then opens the front door and Phoebe gets out.)

MICHAEL: Jimmie, we're here!

BELLHOP: Good evening.

GREEN: Thank you.

(The Marsdens talk together intelligibly.)

BELLHOP: Excuse me, sir.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Hello.

(The bellhop closes both doors as Green and the Marsdens scurry off. L'Ively, decked out in a tuxedo, gets out of the driver's side, watches them go, and sighs. Inside, Mulder leans up against a wall, drinking some champagne, as people walk by talking. He looks on as the Marsdens walk up the stairs, followed by Phoebe. He watches her walk by. Later, Mulder stands by himself in an empty room with a buffet table. The crowd can still be heard. He looks at his watch as Phoebe walks in. She walks over to him.)

GREEN: Enjoying yourself?

MULDER: Good food, witty conversation. I'm having the time of my life.

(Phoebe laughs.)

GREEN: I wondered if you'd think it's safe enough to indulge ourselves in a dance.

MULDER: It doesn't look like your arsonist is going to make an appearance.

GREEN: That doesn't mean there won't be any fires to put out.

(They start slow dancing.)

I've thought about you often.

(Scully walks down the hall and sees Mulder and Green dancing. She stops, rolls her eyes a little, and sighs. She looks at her watch, then turns to see L'Ively standing there, smiling. She tries to look away and sees Mulder and Green kissing. She tries to look away from that and sees that L'Ively is gone. She looks around for him and hears a beeping. She turns to see a control panel with a list of the floors and lights next to them, as well as two columns of lights to the right that are for smoke and fire, respectively. The light beeps next the 14th floor, as well as the two lights for smoke and fire for that floor. She runs over to Mulder and Phoebe.)

SCULLY: There's a fire upstairs.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: On the fourteenth floor.

GREEN: That's where the children are.

(She runs off with Scully as Mulder runs down the hall that Scully came from. Upstairs, the fire dances it's way down the hallway. Mulder runs up the stairs as Scully runs past the crowd.)

SCULLY: We've got a fire on the fourteenth floor!

(A bellhop runs off and the crowd murmurs. Lady and Sir Marsden run out and watch her run off. Mulder reaches the door to the fourteenth floor, out of breath. He puts his hand on the door and closes his eyes, trying to control his fear. He takes a deep breath and opens the door. The hallway is covered with smoke and Mulder keeps close to the floor, coughing.)

MICHAEL: Help, help!

(The fire erupts out of the hallway and Mulder stands a little, then drops to his knees, not moving anymore. He coughs and starts to crawl back the other way. He coughs and wheezes, slumping against the wall as firemen start up the stairs. A man runs by carrying Michael and Jimmie. Two firemen stop at Mulder, who is nearly out.)

FIREMAN #1: Here we go, got one out. Come on, buddy, come on. Come on, here we go...

(They lift him to his feet and support him.)

And we go up!

FIREMAN #2: You got him?

FIREMAN #1: Yup, here we go...

(The first fireman puts Mulder's arm around him and helps him off. Downstairs, L'Ively comes out of the elevator with Michael and Jimmie as people watch on in awe.)

L'IVELY: Here we are.

(Lady and Sir Marsden run to their children. Everybody speaks at once, some patting L'Ively on the back.)

LADY MARSDEN: You saved their lives.

(Scully looks back to see the fireman coming out, Mulder being helped by one, wearing an oxygen mask. Scully goes over to him as he slumps down to the floor. She looks back and sees Phoebe shake L'Ively's hand.)

GREEN: Marvelous. Good job. Thank you.

(Scully puts her hand on Mulder's head, but he moves it off, coughing into the mask. Later, Mulder lies in bed with his shirt off, Scully sitting on the bed. Mulder continues coughing and Scully hands him a glass of water, which he drinks.)

SCULLY: You were really out.

MULDER: Where's Phoebe?

SCULLY: She's down the hall.

(Mulder sighs.)

MULDER: How about the kids?

SCULLY: Okay, the doctor checked them out.

(Mulder gets up, wearing only black boxers, picks up his robe and starts towards the bathroom.)

What happened to you up there?

MULDER: I panicked. I couldn't move, Scully.

SCULLY: It could've happened to anyone.

MULDER: Yeah, but it happened to me. I hared out. Plain and simple.

(He goes into the bathroom as Phoebe walks in behind Scully.)

SCULLY: What do you know about this guy that saved the kids? The driver?

GREEN: I checked him out prior to the Marsdens' arrival.

(Scully stands and looks at her as she closes the door.)

He's worked on the property for eight years. No record. His references checked out. They were lucky he was here tonight.

SCULLY: Who was watching the kids tonight?

GREEN: He was.

SCULLY: Are you sure? I could have sworn I saw him down in the hallway about the same time that the fire broke out.

(Mulder walks out of the bathroom wearing a robe.)

GREEN: He couldn't have. Anyway, the man we're looking for is English.

MULDER: Hey.

(They looks at him. He closes his robe.)

GREEN: I came to see if you were okay.

MULDER: How are the kids?

GREEN: They're fine. Everybody's anxious to get back.

MULDER: To the cape?

GREEN: Only to pack. They've, uh, made travel arrangements to return to England the day after tomorrow.

MULDER: And you?

GREEN: I'll be leaving in a few days.

(Mulder nods.)

Look, I'll give you a ring back at the Bureau before I leave.

MULDER: Right.

(Phoebe walks to the door and looks at Scully.)

GREEN: Goodbye.

(She leaves. Mulder goes to sit down on the couch.)

SCULLY: You all right?

(He sits and puts his feet up on the table.)

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: You at all interested in what I came up here to show you?

MULDER: Yeah.

(She sits down across from him and unlocks her briefcase.)

SCULLY: Well, I did a little checking of my own. I didn't know a whole lot about arson or arsonists so I took the opportunity... for my own edification, of course.

(He smiles. She pulls a paper out of her briefcase and gives it to Mulder.)

I ran a profile of possible incendiary fuels and accelerants that could have been used in the crimes.

(The list says "Representative Liquid Propelant Fuels" at the top and lists a number of fuels, their densities and heat of concentration. The fuels are: Argotypoline, Ammonia (Liquid), Ballium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon (qr), Decarbonate and a few others.)

I also took the liberty of running a search through Interpol of all the gardeners, manservants and domestic help that were hired by the murder victims at the time of their death.

(She hands him that list.)

MULDER: And?

SCULLY: And these people probably don't even tie their own shoes. There were over two-hundred names. And not a duplicate. Except one. A "Cecil L'Ively." He worked as a gardener for two of the victims.

MULDER: What did you find on him?

SCULLY: Nothing.

MULDER: So he's clean.

SCULLY: Apparently, he was question by Scotland Yard and they released him but I dug a little further. Cecil L'Ively is a documented citizen of Great Britain, paid his taxes, never been on the dole, a model citizen until he died in 1971 in a London tenement fire.

(He looks at her strangely.)

I know, that's what I thought. So, I checked a little further. Cecil L'Ively, spelled "L apostrophe," came up again. In fact, it came up twice. First, on a list of death certificates listed among a group of children who died in ritual sacrifice by a satanic cult in 1963 in the Toddingham Woods outside Bath, England.

MULDER: Where else did you find him?

SCULLY: You're going to love this. On a list of recent visas issued by the British government. Cecil L'Ively's passport was stamped by U.S. immigration officials two weeks ago at the port of entry in Boston.

(Mulder looks around, stands and takes off his robe.)

MULDER: Call the local field office in Boston of the F.B.I. and get them to fax to you the composite that the witness did of the man who burned down the bar and then get them to fax it to every local law enforcement agency in the area.

(He picks up his suit.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: I'm going to try and catch Phoebe, this guy could be waiting for them in Cape Cod.

(He runs into the bathroom. Later, Scully is on the phone. She looks at her watch.)

SCULLY: Yes, this is Special Agent Scully. I've been waiting on hold for you guys to fax me a composite of an arson suspect. Right. Hang on a second.

(A whirring starts.)

It's coming through. Thanks.

(She looks down at the fax machine and a composite comes out of Cecil L'Ively.)

Oh my God. It's the driver.

(Scully takes out her phone and, looking at the picture, dials Mulder's number.)

CELLULAR PHONE MESSAGE: We're sorry. The cellular customer you are trying to reach is out of the area.

(She hangs up and stares at L'Ively's picture.)




SCENE 19
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS
(L'Ively watches from his window, smoking, as Mulder pulls up. Mulder runs in the front door and finds he has interrupted an embrace between Green and Marsden on the stairs. They pull away from each other, and Marsden clears his throat.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Excuse me.

(He walks up the stairs. Phoebe walks tentatively to Mulder.)

MULDER: His name is Cecil L'Ively.

GREEN: Who?

MULDER: Your arsonist. Where's the rest of the family?

GREEN: They went outside for a walk.

MULDER: Well, go find them. We've got to get them packed and get them out of here.

(She looks at him, then walks away. Outside, she brings the children and Lady Marsden back to the house. The children whine and complain.)

GREEN: Come on, we have to hurry... let's go. Come on, this way.

(Cecil watches them run into the house, all murmuring. He smiles and walks up the stairs past Lady Marsden's portrait. Later, a knock on the door. Mulder opens it and Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: It's the driver.

MULDER: I know. He disappeared.

SCULLY: What's the matter?

MULDER: Nothing, um... I found this out in the garage.

(He hands her the can of argotypoline.)

It's been very hard on the family.

(Phoebe and Sir and Lady Marsden run down the stairs.)

GREEN: Did you get the composite?

SCULLY: Yes.

LADY MARSDEN: I don't believe it, I can't believe it. He's worked for us for over ten years.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Well, obviously there's been some type of mistake.

(Scully hands him the rendition of L'Ively.)

Oh...

LADY MARSDEN: Oh my God!

MALCOLM MARSDEN: This isn't the driver, it's the caretaker!

LADY MARSDEN: And he's upstairs with the children!

(Mulder looks up the stairs. Sitting on a dresser is the bottle of Pembroke's cough syrup. Scully walks past the room.)

SCULLY: Michael?

(Mulder walks in.)

MULDER: Michael? Jimmie?

(He looks at the cough syrup as Scully walks in. He opens the bathroom door and they see a charred husk of the driver, kneeling over the toilet as if he was vomiting when he died.)

It looks like we found the missing driver.

(Phoebe calls from down the hall.)

GREEN: Mulder! In here, quickly!

(They run in and see the other three looking at the drapes, which has caught fire.)

LADY MARSDEN: What's going on?

GREEN: They just went up all by themselves.

(Mulder looks around for something when the painting hanging over the bed behind him erupts in flames.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: My God!

(Mulder takes a sheet and tries in vain to put out the fires. The bed then starts burning. Phoebe and Lady Marsden scream a little.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Oh my God...

MULDER: Everybody out!

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Let's go, get out...

(They run out, Mulder closing the door behind him. Malcolm grabs his wife's hand.)

MULDER: I think he rigged the whole house.

LADY MARSDEN: Oh God...

(She runs into her husbands arms. Mulder smells the sheet he's carrying.)

MULDER: It's fuel.

(Mulder drops it as it catches fire.)

LADY MARSDEN: What?

GREEN: Oh my God...

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Go, go...

(They start running down the hall.)

SCULLY: Quick, come on...

(They run down the stairs, coughing.)

MULDER: Scully, see if you can find a fire extinguisher. Everybody else, outside.

(Scully walks off to get one.)

LADY MARSDEN: But what about the children?

(They hear a banging on a door and the dog barking.)

MULDER: I'll take care of the children. Go!

(The Marsdens walk out. Phoebe grabs Mulder's arm.)

GREEN: Are you going to be okay, Mulder?

MULDER: Oh yeah. I'll be fine. There's no place I'd rather be.

(He takes out his gun and runs up the stairs. Phoebe leaves the house. He looks around down the hallway then walks slowly, the only sound his footsteps. He passes a few doors and hears some noise in one. The dog barks inside the room. He tries the doorknob, but it is locked.)

MULDER: Michael? Jimmie?

MICHAEL: Help...

(The children can be heard coughing. Mulder hits the door with his shoulder a few times. Behind him, at the end of the hallway, appears L'Ively.)

L'IVELY: Time to call 911.

(Mulder spins around and points his gun at him in one fluid motion.)

MULDER: Don't move!

(L'Ively raises his hands and snaps his fingers with the left one. The hallway literally explodes in flames, the paintings catching fire one by one down the hall. The fire rises to the ceiling as Mulder stares in awe. Mulder jumps backwards to the ground as the paintings where he was standing burst into flames as well. As the flames cover the ceiling, L'Ively turns and starts down the stairs only to see Scully standing at the bottom, pointing her gun.)

SCULLY: Freeze! Federal agent.

L'IVELY: You won't shoot me.

(He starts walking towards her.)

SCULLY: Stay right where you are.

(L'Ively jumps down a stair.)

L'IVELY: See? Cause you don't know the spark from that round won't blow this whole house to kingdom come.

(L'Ively slowly walks. Scully squeezes the trigger. L'Ively smiles as Scully backs away slowly. His face suddenly turns serious. Green turns the corner from the other room and splashes the accelerant in his face. L'Ively staggers back.)

GREEN: Back off the gun! It's the accelerant!

L'IVELY: No!

(L'Ively staggers and spins out the door. Mulder stares at the fire while the boys scream. He takes a deep breath and starts moving slowly, staying very low to the ground, hands on the walls. He lets out a slight scream in pain and winces, pulling back his hand when he touches a hot part of the wall. He rams his elbow into the door twice, knocking it open the second time. L'Ively staggers out onto the lawn, trying to shake the feeling of the accelerant away. Mulder runs out the door carrying Michael and Jimmie.)

LADY MARSDEN: Oh Michael! Jimmie!

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Michael! Jimmie! Thank God, thank God!

(The boys run into their parents' arms. L'Ively stops and turns back to the house. He laughs insanely as he bursts into flame.)

L'IVELY: You can't kill me!

(Scully slowly lowers her gun as they all watch him spin around, laughing.)

L'IVELY: You can't fight fire with fire!

(He finally stops laughing as he falls to the ground, his body burning.)




SCENE 20
X-FILES OFFICE
FBI HEADQUARTERS
(Mulder sits at his desk, wearing glasses, thinking.)

SCULLY: (with English accent) Care to take me to lunch?

(Mulder looks back to see Scully at the door, smiling.)

Scare you?

MULDER: You have no idea.

SCULLY: Where is Phoebe?

(She sits down on the desk.)

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: You don't know? She didn't call?

MULDER: No. She did messenger this to me last night though.

(He holds up a tape.)

SCULLY: Did you play it?

MULDER: No.

(He looks at it.)

SCULLY: Why not? Aren't you curious what's on it?

MULDER: Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it.

(He gets up.)




SCENE 21
BOSTON MERCY HOSPITAL
(Scully does a voice-over of her report as a nurse walks into an enclosed room.)

SCULLY: X-File number 11214893. Addendum to the file opened by Special Agent Mulder. The arson suspect Cecil L'Ively was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital with fifth and sixth-degree burns over his entire body. Military burn specialists have been brought in to study the case which they're calling "extraordinary."

(Cut to Scully typing on her laptop.)

Not only for the fact that the suspect survived, but for the rapid regeneration of his basal cell tissue. Full recovery is anticipated in as little as a month.

(Cut back to the hospital. A man unlocks a door for the nurse.)

L'Ively is being held in a high-security medical facility...

GUARD: There you go.

NURSE: Thank you.

(She walks in.)

SCULLY: ...confined to a hyperbaric chamber until he can be tried on murder charges in the death of a Massachusetts caretaker. His body temperature remains at a steady 109 degrees.

(The nurse bends down and adjusts a control on the hyperbaric chamber.)

House technicians have removed everything flammable from his room due to several fires which have broken out in the vicinity. According to Agent Mulder, further incarceration remains a problem for federal penal authorities.

(The nurse walks around the chamber and looks into the glass casing in the front. L'Ively is laying there, his head visible. His face is charred almost completely black. He has no hair.)

NURSE: Can I get you anything, sir?

(L'Ively's eyes pop open. He looks around, then turns and looks at her.)

L'IVELY: I'm just dying for a cigarette.

(He licks his lips a little, staring at the nurse.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(William Scully walks over to a small Christmas tree with an angel ornament on top.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: Are you going to leave this up all year?

SCULLY: Yup. All year. Since you always made us take the Christmas tree down the day after Christmas, I'm making up for lost time.

(She starts piling plates on the kitchen table.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: If your idea of a good time is picking up dried pine needles, treat yourself.

MARGARET SCULLY: As if he's an authority on having a good time.

(She walks over, carrying plates from the dinner table. William crosses over to beside Scully.)

SCULLY: That's okay, Mom, I got that.

MARGARET SCULLY: Oh, okay.

WILLIAM SCULLY: Okay, Maggie, let's shove off.

MARGARET SCULLY: Oh, okay.

(She puts the plate down and goes over to Scully. She hugs her.)

Well, thank you for having us. Dinner was delicious as usual.

SCULLY: Thanks, Mom.

(Scully walks over to her father and salutes.)

Good sailing, Ahab.

(He hugs her.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: Goodnight, Starbuck.

(Margaret gives William an urging look as if to ask his daughter a question.)

How's work? Good?

SCULLY: Yup. It's good.

WILLIAM SCULLY: Well...

(William and Margaret cross over to the coatrack by the door and put on their coats. Scully throws down the napkin in her hand onto the table and walks over.)

SCULLY: Well, drive carefully.

MARGARET SCULLY: Uh-huh.

(Scully unlocks the door and kisses her mother goodbye.)

SCULLY: Goodnight, Daddy.

(The parents walk out. She watches them go, then closes the door. Later. It is now 1:47. On TV, a man is talking on an informercial under his picture, it says:

"Ron Popeil
Inventor")

RON POPEIL ON TV: Here on Incredible Inventions though, you're not going to spend 110 dollars for it. You all know that. You're not even going to spend a hundred dollars.

(The caption changes to:

" Approximate One Month Supply
Time May Vary Depending On Frequency
of Use or Size of Area to be Covered")

There's an approximate one-month supply here...

(They show two videos, one in the upper right, the other in the lower left, of "hair" being sprayed onto bald people's heads. In the upper left it reads "Only $39.92.")

And all you'll spend for this entire package is just 39 dollars and 92 cents.

(There is applause and cheering. Scully is sleeping on the couch, a blanket draped over her.
Her eyes open.)

WOMAN ON TV: Mr. Johnson?

RON POPEIL ON TV: Yes?

(Scully sees her father sitting in a chair in front of her, blue light shining down on him. His mouth is moving but no words are coming out.)

WOMAN ON TV: I was kind of interested that Allen used a blond and I hadn't seen anyone use a blond.

SCULLY: Dad? I thought you guys left.

(She sits up.)

Where's Mom?

(There is no answer. He is talking but making no noise. The phone rings, startling her. She looks back at the phone, then to her father. The chair is empty. Scully is very confused as the phone rings again. She gets up, blanket still covering her, and starts walking to the phone. It rings twice more before she picks it up.)

Hello.

(There is no answer except for some muffled crying.)

Hello?

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana?

SCULLY: Mom? What's the matter?

MARGARET SCULLY: We, um... we lost your dad. He had a... a massive coronary... about an hour ago. He... he's gone.

(Scully looks back to where she saw her father sitting. The chair is still empty.)




SCENE 2
JACKSON UNIVERSITY; NORTH CAROLINA
(A teenage boy and girl are making out in a car on the side of the road.)

GIRL: I swear, Christmas Day... my whole family's opening presents and all and I'm just sitting there in my own little world, thinking "I just wish Jim were here."

BOY: Hmmm, I know.

(There is a knock on the window. They look at the window as a flashlight shines through. A police officer, Lucas Henry, is standing there.)

Oh man, busted.

(She gets off of him as he wipes his lips. He rolls down the window.)

Yes, sir?

HENRY: Out of the vehicle, please.

BOY: We're sorry, sir. We'll be on our way.

HENRY: I said, out of the vehicle

(The boy looks at the girl, rolls up the window and gets out of the car. He can't make out the officer's face because the light is shining in his face. He raises his hand to deflect the light.)

Keep your hands down. Let's see some ID.

(The boy looks down and sees that the "officer" is wearing jeans and boots.)

BOY: No, not till I see yours.

(Henry hits the boy in the face with the flashlight. The girl screams as the boy's face slams into the window and slides down, leaving a trail of blood.)




SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is reading a file. Scully sneaks up behind him and looks over his shoulder.)

SCULLY: Last time you were that engrossed, it turned out you were reading the Adult Video News.

MULDER: I didn't think you'd be in today. How are you, Dana?

SCULLY: "Dana." I'm fine, thank you. What are you working on?

MULDER: Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped at Jackson University. Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers, both 19.

(Mulder shows her a picture of the couple.)

Last year, another couple was kidnapped to the day except that abduction occured at Duke University. One week later, they found both students' bodies dead.

(Scully looks over the file.)

SCULLY: They were kept alive, tortured through that period.

MULDER: No arrests were ever made. Police believed it to be a one-time offender but now it appears to be a serial incident. Anyway, if he holds true to form, we have five days to find those kids.

SCULLY: That's a grim deadline.

MULDER: Well, here's another grim deadline.

(He reaches over and picks up a folder off a desk. He gives it to her.)

In one week, Luther Lee Boggs will take a seat in the North Carolina gas chamber.

SCULLY: How is he related?

MULDER: He claims to have information relating to the kidnapping. He described Hawley's bracelet down to the last detail. This is information that only family members could have known.

SCULLY: Or the kidnapper.

MULDER: Boggs feels that if his talents help save these kids then his sentence should be reduced to life in prison.

SCULLY: His talents?

MULDER: He claims to have obtained this information through psychic transmission.

(He goes over and sits at his desk.)

SCULLY: Mulder, do I detect a hint of skepticism?

MULDER: Perhaps.

(She sits down opposite him.)

Boggs has been there before... in the chamber. My profile helped send him there. He was actually strapped to the chair before recieving an executive stay. He claims that this experience activated in him the ability to channel spirits and demons. I believe in psychic ability, without a doubt, but not
in this case. Not Boggs.

SCULLY: So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from the inside.
A scam to save his life?

(Mulder nods. He hands her a file.)

MULDER: At the age of six, Luther Boggs slaughtered every pet animal in his housing project. When he was thirty, he strangled five family members over Thanksgiving dinner and then sat down to watch the fourth quarter of the Detroit - Green Bay game. Some killers are projects of society. Some act out past abuses. Boggs kills because he likes it.

SCULLY: And they've requested you speak with him?

(Mulder gets up.)

MULDER: Actually, he's requested to speak to me.

SCULLY: Why you?

(He puts his gun in his holster.)

MULDER: He read my profile on him and he believes I'm the only one who truly understands what he is. Anyway, I leave for Raleigh this afternoon.

SCULLY: I'll go with you.

(She stands.)

The funeral's at noon.

MULDER: I think you should take some time.

SCULLY: I need to work.

MULDER: I'm sorry about your father.

(He puts his hand on her cheek. She nods. He starts out.)

I'll see you later.

SCULLY: (whispering) Okay.

(Mulder takes his coat and leaves. Scully goes to the file cabinet and pulls out a file that reads:

"Federal Bureau
of
Investigation

DC-X-167512

Visionary Encounters
w/ The Dead"

She puts hit back in the drawer and slams it shut.)




SCENE 4
WILLIAM SCULLY'S FUNERAL
(A man stands on a dock and dumps out William Scully's ashes into the air as Beyond the Sea plays loudly. On the shore stands Scully's family. Dana is standing next to her mother.)

SCULLY: As a captain, he was entitled to burial at Arlington with full ceremony.

MARGARET SCULLY: This is exactly how he wanted it. Just the family.

(There is an uncomfortable pause. The man dumping out the ashes holds up the empty urn and takes off his hat.)

This song was playing when his ship returned from the Cuban Blockade. He marched right off up to me... and he proposed.

(She starts to cry.)

SCULLY: I know that you and Dad were... disappointed that I chose the path I'm on instead of medicine but I need to know... was he at all proud of me?

MARGARET SCULLY: He was your father.

(A seagull cries out.)




SCENE 5
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(Luther Lee Boggs sits in a chair, handcuffs on. On his left hand, the word "Kiss" is written on his knuckles. On the right, the word "Kill.")

BOGGS: The soul of Luther Boggs drowns in hell's sea of fire. We have him now.

(Scully is sitting, Mulder is standing.)

MULDER: We? You mean the souls of your victims?

BOGGS: The dead. The living. All souls are connected.

MULDER: And you're the conduit?

(Mulder sits. Boggs' breathing becomes labored. His whole speech and movement pattern changes to a more womanly tone.)

BOGGS: Uh... Dana... Fox... please understand that from here, we can return to the past.
We can see the present. We can know the future.

MULDER: From here? Where exactly are you?

(Boggs' mood changes back to the previous one.)

BOGGS: Mr. Boggs must be made redemptive for his transgressions.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: That's exactly what the state of North Carolina intends to do next week.

(Boggs' tone and movement becomes more of a Brooklyn man.)

BOGGS: No. Uh-uh. Let's deal. Boggs' life for the kids, you know what I'm saying?

MULDER: First you've got to prove you're telling the truth.

(Boggs looks at him warily. Mulder pulls a small package out of his pocket.)

Don't get me wrong, Luther. I want to believe.

(He pulls a piece of blue cloth out of the bag, which Boggs takes. Boggs' breathing becomes heavier as he rubs the cloth between his hands, bringing it up to his mouth.)

BOGGS: Oh... ah... oh, God, no. Must stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Pain! I'm in... pain, terrible pain...

(Mulder sits on the table, smiling slightly.)

Uh... the boy, uh, Jim... he's tied with twine. Uh, packing twine.

(He holds his wrists out. He begins spouting short screams, holding the cloth to his face, fists clenched.)

Uh, he, he whip, he whips them with a, a coat hanger, a wire coat hanger. Oh.

(His breathing becomes labored as he looks up at Mulder with wild eyes.)

Dark place. Cold. Cellar. Warehouse, condemned. An angel... of stone. Waterfall. Water falling. It's, it's not a waterfall. Not water. They're there. Oh, God. I got to go. I got to go. I, I got to go.

(He slumps down in his chair. Mulder walks over slowly and kneels down in front of his face.
He takes the cloth out of his hand and holds it up.)

MULDER: I tore this off my New York Knicks t-shirt. It has nothing to do with the crime.

(He gets up and leaves. Scully picks up her briefcase and starts out.)

BOGGS: (singing) Somewhere... beyond the sea...

(She stops.)

Somewhere... waiting for me...

(She turns around. Boggs looks up. In her eyes, he is replaced by William Scully. She backs away a little, startled, in emotional pain, eyes closed. She opens them and looks at Boggs, who is back to normal. His tone has now assumed that of William Scully's.)

Did you get my message, Starbuck?

(Scully rushes out past Mulder, who is talking to a security guard.)

GUARD: Alright, thanks a lot.

(The guard goes back in his booth. Scully stops at the door. Mulder looks at her. She slowly turns around.)

MULDER: Scully, what's wrong? Did Boggs say something to you?

SCULLY: No. It's my father. I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

MULDER: It's alright. Why don't you go back to the motel? We've exposed Boggs as a fraud. Boggs is not what he claims to be. He may be orchestrating the kidnapping. Now he knows that we're on to him, he doesn't have a chance with this charade. I'm going to wait around a couple of hours and try to interrogate him. Hopefully, he'll tell me where the kids are.

(Boggs walks out behind them, a security guard on each side leading him back to his cell.)

BOGGS: (singing) Somewhere... beyond the shore... we'll kiss just as before... happy we'll be... beyond the sea...

(The door opens and Scully rushes out.)

And never again...




SCENE 6
NORTH CAROLINA
(Scully sits in her car. She comes to a red light and closes her eyes, remembering what Boggs said.)

BOGGS: (flashback) Water falling. It's, it's not a waterfall.

(A honking car snaps her out of it. She opens her eyes and sees Hotel Niagara, a hotel with a sign that has a waterfall behind the letters. In her mind, she sees Boggs again.)

An angel of stone.

(She looks to her left and sees a stone statue of an angel holding another in it's arms, wings spread. Scully makes a sharp right turn and pulls into an alley. She stops the car at a door, which has a condemned sign on it. She walks in to the room, which is very quiet, except for water dripping. Two pigeons fly off and she is startled. She shines the flashlight on the ground and sees various candles and a beer bottle. Bending over, she picks up a small bracelet on the floor. She holds it up to the candle and looks at it, but something catches her eye. She looks across the floor and sees several wire coat hangers.)




SCENE 7
SCULLY'S MOTEL ROOM
(Scully sits in her chair. She sees another vision of her father, sitting across from her, speaking to her with no words. There is a knock at the door.)

MULDER: It's Mulder.

(She gets up to answer the door. No one is in that chair across from her. She opens the door.)

I just heard that Liz Hawley's family made a positive ID on the charm you found at the warehouse. The police are searching that place inch-by-inch but they haven't been able to find anything yet. I expected to find you at the crime scene.

(Scully goes over and puts the chairs away. Mulder comes in.)

SCULLY: Did Boggs confess?

MULDER: No, no, just five hours of Boggs' channeling. After three hours, I asked him to summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix and requested "All Along the Watchtower." You know the guy's been dead for twenty years and he still hasn't lost his edge.

SCULLY: I lied to the police about how I found the warehouse. I didn't notice any suspicious activities.

MULDER: Then how did you find it?

SCULLY: It was where Boggs said it would be.

MULDER: Scully, I told you about Boggs...

SCULLY: I didn't go looking for it! I came across an area that had landmarks he spoke of...

MULDER: That doesn't matter! That's exactly what Boggs wanted! He could have been setting you up! You could be dead right now! Why did you lie in your police report?

SCULLY: I thought it would be a better explanation under the circumstances.

MULDER: What you're really saying is that you didn't want to go on record admitting that you believed in Boggs! The bureau would expect something like that from "Spooky" Mulder, but not Dana Scully.

SCULLY: I thought that you'd be pleased that I opened myself to extreme possibilities.

MULDER: Why now? After all we've seen, why Boggs?

(Mulder sits down.)

Does this have to do with your father?

(She shakes her head.)

You said that he didn't approve of you becoming an FBI agent. Now, if being on the job now makes you feel guilty or uncomfortable or uneasy, I think you should back away because if it's clouding your judgement, you're putting yourself in danger.

SCULLY: I love this job.

MULDER: You love your father.

(About to cry she walks to the other side of the room.)

Dana... open yourself up to extreme possibilities only when they're the truth. That goes for Luther Boggs... and your father. As for Luther Boggs, he's the greatest of lies.

(He stands up and goes to her. They both sit down.)

I know he's working with someone on the outside and they planted that evidence. Now, we have to be very careful about planning our next move because he's five steps ahead. The one advantage we have is time.

(He holds up a newspaper. An article at the bottom has the headline "Gas Chamber Tested for Boggs' Execution.")




SCENE 8
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(Scully sits at a desk, looking at her watch. Mulder comes over and puts a paper down in front of her.)

MULDER: Scully, look at this.

(The headline reads "Kidnapped College Students Found Safe." Under that, it reads "Police seek suspect.")

SCULLY: Incredible! They found them?

MULDER: That's exactly what I want Boggs to think.

(He sits down.)

SCULLY: I don't understand, why didn't the police notify us?

MULDER: They haven't been found, the article is bogus. The Carolinian made this one up just for us, only six people know about it. Later on today, Boggs gets his weekly phone priviliges. Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice to find out what happened.

(We see the small slot to Boggs' door open and a hand puts down the fake newspaper. Through the slot, we see Boggs get off his bed and pick up the newspaper. The slot closes. Mulder looks at a camera into Boggs' room, seeing Boggs sit down on his cot and read, and then his watch. Scully sits behind him.)

Phone privilige is in two hours.

(Boggs is lead down the hall by two security guards. Mulder, Scully, some security guards and some suit-and-ties watch as he is lead into a room with a phone. Boggs runs his hands through his hair then picks up the phone and starts dialing. Scully leans over to the man next to her.)

SCULLY: Go.

(The man starts the tape recorder. Boggs looks directly at the camera as he puts the phone to his ear. In the security room, a phone starts ringing.)

MULDER: Turn off that phone. Turn it off.

(They all look for the phone until Scully sees Mulder's jacket.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's you.

(Mulder reaches into his coat pocket, pulls out his cell phone, pulls up the antenna, pushes a button, and puts it to his ear.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Boggs is on the other end.)

BOGGS: (through phone) How come you don't believe me?

(Mulder looks at the monitor. Boggs is looking right back at him.)

Agent Scully believes me.

MULDER: Agent Scully believes what we all believe. That you have the kids. Now where are they?

(Boggs drops the phone and moans. Scully stands.)

SCULLY: Mulder... even if he is setting us up, we have to follow because in three days...

MULDER: Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead.

SCULLY: And then a day later, our only connection to the case will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber.

(In the monitor, Boggs is breathing heavy and labored.)

We have to deal.

(In the interrogation room before, Boggs sits in the same chair. His breathing is heavy. Mulder sits across from him.)

BOGGS: The kidnapper is aroused by the prospect of becoming a killer.

MULDER: What's the name?

BOGGS: Can't see... male...

MULDER: Describe him.

BOGGS: Small... thin... late twenties... skull...

(Flashes quickly to Henry's skull earring.)

Human skull...

(Flashes again to Henry's earring.)

Silver gray... his eyes, cold, very cold...

(Flashes to Henry whipping his head and facing the camera. His eyes are blue and look dead.)

Staring at Elizabeth...

(On the ground, Elizabeth is tied up and gagged, struggling at her bonds.
Boggs grimaces and chokes on his words.)

God, he's got the wire...

(Henry bends the wire coat hanger, thinning it out.)

No... please, no...

(Henry finishes thinning it and whips it down. Boggs reacts as if he was struck himself. We now see Scully is sitting in the back.)

MULDER: Where is he?

BOGGS: He's over... over... by the window...

(We see Henry looking down at a desk next to a hole in the wall. In the back, we see Elizabeth. Henry slowly looks up.)

Holding back... holding back his thoughts of killing us... waiting... there's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan.

(Mulder looks back at Scully, who writes it down in her notepad.)

MULDER: Did you get that?

(Scully closes her notepad and puts it and her pen away. She and Mulder get up. A buzz is heard and the door opens. They start to walk out.)

BOGGS: Mulder...

(They turn back.)

Don't go near the white cross. We see you down... and your blood spills on the white cross.

(They walk out.)




SCENE 9
BOATHOUSE; LAKE JORDAN, RALEIGH, CAROLINA
(Henry walks towards Jim and Elizabeth, whipping his leg with the coat hanger. Michael and Elizabeth scream with every whip. Jim is tied to a pole and gagged. Henry bends down to Elizabeth and raises the coat hanger to strike her.)

ELIZABETH: (muffled) No, no, no, no, no more...

(A bang is heard and Henry looks up. Outside, agents surround the boathouse. Scully and Mulder lead the way as a team of FBI agents go to the main door. An agent kicks down the door and they all run in.)

AGENT: Do you see anything?

2ND AGENT: Negative.

(Scully and Mulder see Elizabeth on the floor. Scully runs over to check her.)

SCULLY: Sweep the docks!

(While the agents start filing out, Mulder checks down a passage way. He shines his flashlight with his gun right above. As he approaches the back, we see more visibly a giant white cross. Hearing a noise, he turns around. Across the water hangs some sheets draped over a line. He sees some rustling and points his gun.)

MULDER: Federal agent!

(A gunshot goes off through the drape and hits Mulder. Mulder screams and falls. Scully hears the shot.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Henry, draped in the sheets, drives off in a motorboat. Scully rushes to Mulder's side. We hear agents shouting orders to each other illegibly.)

AGENT: Get in there, now!

SCULLY: We need an ambulance... officer down!

(She undoes her coat, takes it off and drapes it over Mulder. Turning around quickly, she sees a giant white cross towering over them. Mulder's blood is on it.)




SCENE 10
HOSPITAL; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(Two men wheel Mulder into an emergency room. Mulder is wearing an oxygen mask.)

PARAMEDIC: What do we got?

DOCTOR: Through and through upper femur...

NURSE: Can't palpate a radial pulse...

DOCTOR: Okay, I want a B.P. on this stat... get him on the gurney.

PARAMEDIC: One, two, three...

(The paramedics lift him off the wheeler and onto the gurney. Mulder coughs and shakes. Scully walks in.)

NURSE: Blood pressure is 67 on palpatation.

DOCTOR: Okay, tighten him and screen him for six, I want two liters of normal saline in him now and give him two units of o-neg after the typing. Let's transfer now.




SCENE 11
ELIZABETH HAWLEY'S HOSPITAL BED
(Elizabeth is looking at pictures of different criminals. Scully is standing next to the bed as a man flips the cards for her. She looks at the first one.)

ELIZABETH: No.

(He flips to the next one.)

No.

(The next one.)

No.

(He flips to the next one and she looks away. The man gives the picture to Scully, and another man reads from a file.)

MAN: Lucas Jackson Henry, 28. Did some time at Angola in Louisiana for sexual assault, narcotics, nothing big, really. His personal history includes being witness to an auto accident in which his high school sweetheart was killed and his mother was decaptiated.

(He hands her the file. She looks at the profiles.)

The seven year anniversary of that accident is in three days.

SCULLY: He's reliving it. That would explain the deadline.

(She walks over to the window.)

MAN: The most important element we found is that there's substantial suspicion that Luther Lee Boggs' last five murders were commited with a partner. Now, the police up in Durham say they could never prove it in court but they know that partner was Lucas Henry.




SCENE 12
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(A buzz sounds and the door opens to the same room as before. A security guard walks out as Scully marches in. Boggs sits in the chair.)

SCULLY: You set us up. You're in on this with Lucas Henry. This was a trap for Mulder because he helped put you away. Well, I came here to tell you that if he dies because of what you've done, four days from now, no one will be able to stop me from being the one that will throw the switch and gas you out of this life for good, you son of a bitch!

(She turns back to the door and waits for it to open.)

BOGGS: Dana...

(She turns back. Instead of seeing Boggs there, she sees Mulder.)

(as Mulder) You're the one that believed me!

(She covers her ears and closes her eyes.)

SCULLY: No! No, I do not believe you!

(She opens them and Boggs is back to normal.)

BOGGS: If you don't believe me, maybe you'll believe yourself.

(He pauses and starts playing with his hair. His mannerism changes again, this time to a little boy's.)

There was that one time when I was fourteen and my parents had gone to bed and I snuck downstairs all alone. Got one of my mom's cigarettes and went out onto the porch in the dark. I was so scared. My heart was beating, I mean, they would have killed me if they knew. But I was so excited. Not ‘cause of the cigarette, I mean, it was gross, but because I wasn't supposed to.

SCULLY: That could be a moment from any kid's life.

(She is shaken by the story. Boggs reverts back to normal.)

BOGGS: I know what you want. And I know who you want to talk to. Why don't you just go ahead and ask me?

(Scully is on the verge of crying.)

SCULLY: I'll believe you... if you let... me talk to him.

(Boggs takes a deep breath, then slumps down and exhales it. He grunts twice. His breathing becomes heavier. He looks at her, his expression and mood like her father's.)

BOGGS: Starbuck...

(Boggs twitches and pulls at his handcuffs, grimacing. His mood and tone become almost demonic.)

No, no, no! Nobody talks to anybody until I get a deal! Don't underestimate my fear of dying and don't downplay my terror of going back to that chair. I know my hell's going to be to go on back to that chair over and over again but in this life, my one and only life, I don't ever want to go back again! Ever! The last time I went to death's door and looked inside...

(The screen grows bright until it goes to black-and-white of a priest reading Last Rites from the Bible. There is no audio.)

I had never talked to a minister before in my life ever until that day and he said, "He who doth not love remains in death and he who hates his brother is a murderer..."

(Boggs looks at the minister. A guard comes in and gives him his last meal.)

"And no murderer has eternal life abiding in him." My family, who I killed after their last meal, was right there to watch me over mine...

(Boggs looks to his left and sees his family standing there, watching him. Boggs is led down a hallway past his family, who is duplicated on either side of him.)

And their fear and their horror that I made them feel when I killed them was injected into me...

(Boggs is strapped into the chair and a wire that detects his heart beat is strapped to his chest.)

And their collective fear alone was just one taste of hell. And then I felt myself leave my body. I thought they had already killed me...

(Boggs tilts his head back and closes his eyes. Suddenly, spirits rush into his body, moaning, their clothes and features briefly replacing his as they move into him.)

And I saw thousands of souls rushing into my body.

(The screen brightens until we are back in the interrogation room.)

It is a cold, dark place, Scully. Mulder's looking in on it right now.

SCULLY: It may be a cold dark place for you but it's not for Mulder and it's not for my father.

BOGGS: I'm sure he'd like to tell you hisself but I'm not going to let him.
Nobody speaks until you get me a deal.

SCULLY: I don't believe you.

BOGGS: Oh well, there's plenty of room in that cold, dark place for liars, Scully. You go ahead and play it like you need to but I know you believe me. But if you need to convince a judge I'm in on it with Lucas, go ahead. ‘Cause either way, whether I'm running the show with Lucas or I'm channeling, no information's coming until I get a deal. Go on, man, I got nothing to lose.

(Scully turns around and faces the door.)

SCULLY: Guard!

(Boggs stands up behind her.)

BOGGS: If I die, that boy goes to that cold, dark place.

(There is a buzz and the cell door and outer door open. She walks out and stops as they slam behind her. She closes her eyes for a moment, then walks away.)




SCENE 13
MULDER'S HOSPITAL BED; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(Scully sits at the side of Mulder's bed as he listens. Instruments are hooked up to him and machines beep in the background.)

SCULLY: There's still no sign of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers. The Raliegh police said...

MULDER: No matter what, don't believe him. Boggs created this whole charade to get back at me for putting him on death row. You'd be the next best thing.

SCULLY: Mulder, I never thought I'd say this... but what if there's another explanation?

MULDER: Don't... deal with him. He could be trying to claim you as his last victim.




SCENE 14
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(A buzz sounds and the door opens. Boggs is lead in by a security guard. The security guard walks out and we hear the door slam. Scully is sitting across from Boggs.)

SCULLY: All right, Mr. Boggs... you got your deal.

(Boggs nods and sheds a few tears.)

BOGGS: Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

SCULLY: Alright, where are they?

(Boggs exhales loudly and slumps back in his chair. Scully watches him with no emotion.
Boggs changes moods again. He looks up at the ceiling.)

BOGGS: Uh... I... uh... I see, like, uh... circles. Uh... I don't know, like... barrels. No, no, bigger, like, uh... huge, uh... vats, uh... factory. Uh, condemned. The old, uh, Blue Devil Brewery up by Morrisville. Oh, God, he's getting, uh, he's getting ready. He... he... he's getting ready to, um, uh... he's getting ready to kill, uh, to kill the d... whoo.

(He exhales and slumps back down. Scully puts her things in her briefcase.)

SCULLY: Luther, if you really were psychic...

BOGGS: I would have known you lied. That there never was a deal. I know you tried.

(She picks up her briefcase and goes to the door. A buzz sounds and it opens.)

Scully...

(She turns around.)

Avoid the devil. Don't follow Henry to the devil. Leave that to me.

(She walks out as a security guard walks in.)




SCENE 15
BLUE DEVIL BREWERY FACTORY; MORRISVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA
(Henry waves an hatchet in the air and screams. He slams the axe head down into a table twice. Tied to a table and his mouth covered with masking tape, Jim groans and starts to cry. Henry walks over to a ledge and jumps down next to Jim. He grabs him by the hair and lifts the hatchet, ready to strike.)

AGENT: Freeze!

(Henry stops and turns around. Agents rush in, guns armed. Scully takes the point, aiming at Henry.)

SCULLY: Federal agents, we're armed! Drop your weapon.

(Henry slowly lowers his weapon. He raises it to throw but Scully shoots him in the side of the chest. He screams and recoils as Scully and a few agents start to chase after him. Henry drops the hatchet and runs as the other agents check on Jim.)

AGENT: There he is!

2ND AGENT: Get an ambulance...

AGENT: Hold it...

2ND AGENT: It's gonna be alright, kid...

(Scully's team turns a corner and runs down a hallway.)

AGENT: Somebody get over here! Go away!

(Henry runs down the hall, crashing into the wall and heaving. The agents stop at stairs, getting on either side of the fixture before it.)

SCULLY: Go!

(An agent runs up the stairs and is hit with a metal barrel in the face. The agent falls down the stairs as Henry runs. Scully and another agent run after Henry while another checks on the fallen one. Henry runs into a dark room where rats are squeaking. He turns left. Scully and the agent go into the room. She goes left, he goes right. Henry runs into another room and up some stairs onto a catwalk. In the background, painted on the wall, is a giant blue devil. Scully runs in, gun poised, but she lowers it when she sees the devil. Henry looks at her and hears a creak under his foot. He
looks down to see the boards breaking under his feet. He falls through, screaming until a crash is heard. Scully looks over the railing to see Henry, dead two or three flights down. Scully sits down on the stairs as another agent runs in.)

AGENT: Over here!

(Scully looks up at the blue devil on the wall.)




SCENE 16
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(The devil's face fades away, replaced with Boggs, who is sitting on his cot. Scully walks over and looks through his cell bars.)

BOGGS: You come to say goodbye?

SCULLY: I believe... that if you had orchestrated this kidnapping, Lucas Henry would have... been aware of the danger you warned me about. He never would have crossed that bridge. So you saved... Jim Summer's life. But you saved mine as well.

(Boggs nods, stands and walks to the cell bars.)

BOGGS: You come for some unfinished business? You want your father's message? Not now.
Be there tonight. Be my witness. And when they got me in that chair and they... open up that shield... you get your message.

(He sits back down on the cot. It is now 5:57. A security guard walks into Luther's cell and puts down his last meal. Boggs looks to the left and sees his dead family again, in black-and-white. Boggs is wearing shackles as he walks down the same hallway. He sees his family lining the halls again, the same way in black-and-white. They whisper to each other. Boggs stops and turns around in emotional pain, but the security guards turn him back around.)




SCENE 17
GAS CHAMBER; CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(Boggs breathes heavily as he is strapped into the chair again. They put the same heart-detecting wire on his chest. The door opens in front of Boggs and two men stand there with a priest.)

PRIEST: Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven...

MAN: Would you like to make a statement?

PRIEST: ...our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

(Another man walks into view. His witness. Boggs shakes his head no. The first man nods to another.)

And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is thy kingdom, thy power and thy glory...

(The contents of the cup spill out into the liquid. The gas rises and the liquid bubbles.)

Forever and ever. Amen.

(The look on Boggs' face is that of pure terror.)




SCENE 18
MULDER'S HOSPITAL BED; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
(Scully sits at the foot of Mulder's bed.)

SCULLY: I was considering Boggs. If he knew that I was your partner, he could have found out everything he knew about me. About my father...

MULDER: Scully.

(She gets up and walks around to him.)

SCULLY: "Beyond the Sea" was playing at my parents' wedding. Visions of deceased loved ones are a common psychological phenomena. If he knew that my father had...

MULDER: Dana. After all you've seen, after all the evidence, why can't you believe?

(She sighs and sits down on his bed.)

SCULLY: I'm afraid. I'm afraid to believe.

MULDER: You couldn't face that fear? Even if it meant never knowing what your father wanted to tell you?

SCULLY: But I do know.

MULDER: How?

SCULLY: He was my father.

(Mulder nods and puts his hand on her shoulder.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
A DANCE CLUB
(Loud music is playing and strobe lights illuminate an otherwise dark club. A young man tries to strike up a conversation with a blonde woman, but without success as she walks away. He goes to a video machine to read his horoscope. A young woman comes alongside him and tries to get his attention, but he appears disinterested and looks back at the video screen. She takes his left hand in hers and suddenly he seems very interested in her. He leans over and she whispers something in his ear. They then walk away hand in hand.)




SCENE 2
A HOTEL ROOM
(Later, they are in bed and have just had sex. She gets off the bed and stands some distance away from the bed, while he tries to catch his breath.)

YOUNG MAN: Oh, my God! That was ... that was incredible. I mean it. You don't believe me. Can you hear me? Hey, I ... I don't even know your name.

(He sits up in bed but then shows signs of being in pain. He coughs and moans, clutching his throat, and falls back in the bed. A foam comes out of his mouth and he appears dead. Nearby, the woman drops her lingerie to the floor, walks across the room and starts to put on the man's clothes. As the camera pans upward, we see that it is now a man.)




SCENE 3
CRIME SCENE (THE HOTEL ROOM), GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND, OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC
(A photographer is taking pictures of the scene while Mulder examines the man's body. Scully stands to the side talking with Detective Horton.)

HORTON: New York businessman calls his wife to say good night, then goes out and picks up some chippy. He brings her back here for sex. Beyond that, well, nothing makes a whole lot of sense.

SCULLY: How's that?

HORTON: Security monitor records the victim entering the room with a woman at 10:13. Same monitor records a male leaving just after midnight.

SCULLY: Couldn't she just have changed clothes?

HORTON: Thought of that. Male is definitely a different person - short hair and at least 30 pounds heavier. The video never recorded his entry, nor the chippy ever leaving.

SCULLY: Well, we're 30 floors up, no other means of egress. Did the medical examiner establish a cause of death?

HORTON: Guy blew an artery. Must have been some roll in the hay.

(Mulder looks up at Scully, who shows no reaction to the Detective's comment.)

SCULLY: Hard to imagine in this day and age someone having sex with a perfect stranger. Any sign of robbery?

HORTON: The male exited wearing the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase. The wallet's gone.

SCULLY: You know, I don't even know why we got this call in the first place.

HORTON: Really? Somebody at the Bureau put out a memo requesting any case involving this exact COD. I assumed it was ...

MULDER: Thanks for the call.




SCENE 4
MULDER'S OFFICE
(Mulder and Scully are looking at slides of several dead bodies, all lying in bed in various stages of undress.)

MULDER: Five deaths. Four in the last six weeks between here and Boston. In each case, the victim dies in the throes of passion. Two women and three men, including the last one.

SCULLY: All young, healthy adults.

MULDER: All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest.

SCULLY: You think there's a new drug on the streets?

MULDER: The oldest drug, not even illegal. Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones.

SCULLY: The chemicals animals secrete? You mean, sexual attractants?

MULDER: Radar love. Only about a hundred times stronger than found anywhere in nature, strong enough to product anaphylactic shock or a coronary.

SCULLY: So you think somebody is synthesizing them?

MULDER: It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations and hold on to your hat, Scully, 'cause you're gonna love this. The pheromones we're talking about - they contain human DNA.

SCULLY: Well, there's still a question as to whether humans can produce pheromones. So how can that be?

MULDER: I don't know. But if it's true, then this guy is a walking aphrodysiac. He's the ultimate sex magnet.

SCULLY: He or she? You've got victims of both sexes. Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor.

MULDER: I know. That is a puzzle.

SCULLY: So what is our profile of the killer? Indeterminate height, weight, sex. Unarmed but extremely attractive.

MULDER: It gets weirder. As I said, there's been four deaths matching this MO in the last six weeks - in Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia and here in Washington.

(Mulder circles the cities on a map that is being displayed with an overhead projector.)

SCULLY: The killer's moving south.

MULDER: There was a death I made a note of about a year ago with the same symptoms. A 32 year-old UMW labor organizer was found dead outside a town called Steveston in the woods of Massachusetts, home to a sect of religious isolationists called 'The Kindred'.

(Mulder shows some slides showing 'The Kindred'.)

SCULLY: Right. They live up there without electricity, phones, any modern amenities, a lot like the Amish.

MULDER: The Kindred are known for their handmade stoneware pottery. They mine the clay themselves in the local hills.

SCULLY: What's so weird about that?

MULDER: The white clay in those hills is particular to that region. It's also the same substance I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim's sides.

SCULLY: Well, wait a minute. Aren't these people famous for their abstinence and their pure Christian ways?

MULDER: Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to clean under his fingernails.




SCENE 5
STEVESTON, MASSACHUSETTS
(Mulder and Scully are walking along what appears to be Main Street. They enter a store run by a man and woman.)

WOMAN: Hi.

MULDER: Excuse me, ma'am, this is federal Agent Scully, I'm Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: We're investigating a possible murder.

WOMAN: Oh, there aren't many killings around here.

MULDER: What can you tell me about the Kindred? They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?

MAN: Yeah, some folks say it's because they're doing ceremonies up there. Voodoo or something. I've got nothing against them, myself. They bring in the tourists.

(Mulder and Scully are looking at a number of framed pictures on the wall behind the counter. There are several spots where the frames have been taken down.)

SCULLY: Did the Kindred let you take those pictures?

MAN: Oh, those. Those are from back in the thirties.

MULDER: What about the missing ones?

MAN: I'm having them reframed. They're right here under the counter.

MULDER: Can I take a look at them?

MAN: Sure.

(The man brings out several additional photographs that Mulder inspects. Outside, a wagon with about a half dozen people, all clothed in black, is being pulled up the street by a pair of horses.)

MULDER: How would I get up to see them?

MAN: Oh, they don't like strangers up there much. Road's in pretty rough shape. (he hands Mulder a map) That's Steveston.

(The wagon passes the front of the store.)

MAN: That's them now. They usually shop at the feed store.

(The wagon stops in front of the feed store. Those riding in the wagon get off and all but one go into the store. One, Brother Andrew, stays with the horses. Mulder and Scully approach, and Mulder tries to get the attention of three of them as they are entering the store.)

MULDER: Excuse me. Ladies? (they pay no attention and enter the store) (to Scully) I think I'm gonna go inside. (in a "rural" accent) You need anything from the feed store?

(Scully shakes her head, remains outside and tries to strike up a conversation with the one tending the horses.)

SCULLY: (to Brother Andrew) Hi.

(Andrew doesn't respond. Scully walks past him and strokes the neck of one of the horses.)

SCULLY: She must have problems on the asphalt. Has she ever thrown a shoe? (Andrew looks away) What's her name?

BROTHER ANDREW: (shyly) Alice.

SCULLY: That's sweet. Did you name her?

BROTHER ANDREW: We named her all together. I'm not allowed to talk outside.

SCULLY: That's all right. (she extends her hand) I'm Dana Scully. I don't mean you any harm.

(Andrew hesitates, then reaches out and Scully smiles. As they shake hands, Andrew strokes the top of her hand with his thumb. Scully's expression becomes blank, then somewhat glassy-eyed. The other Kindred emerge from the store.)

KINDRED MAN: Brother Andrew.

(Andrew releases Scully's hand and gets back on the wagon. Scully appears disoriented. Mulder comes out of the store.)

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing?

SCULLY: I was just talking ...

(Her voice falls off on the last syllable and she seems confused. Mulder notices her odd expression.)

MULDER: You all right?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.

MULDER: You want to sit down?

(Scully doesn't respond. The wagon pulls away from the store, and Mulder and Scully watch them go up the street.)

MULDER: Interesting way of life. You get any sense about them?

SCULLY: There's something up there, Mulder.

MULDER: Oh, I've been saying that for years.




SCENE 6
OUTSIDE STEVESTON
(It is late afternoon. Mulder and Scully park the car as the road becomes very rough. Mulder pulls out the map that he was given at the store. He flips it several times, trying to orient it properly.)

MULDER: Oh, for a 4-wheel drive. Looks like about a mile walk.

SCULLY: After you.

(Shortly afterwards, Mulder is still struggling with the map.)

MULDER: Now ... this ... that's west.

SCULLY: What does the map say?

MULDER: (annoyed) That we should be there already.

(He crumples the map into a ball and punts it upwards. Scully catches it. She sighs, then hears a stick breaking and sees members of the Kindred approaching.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look.

(They are quickly surrounded by about a dozen of the Kindred who close in on them.)

SCULLY: We're FBI agents. Federal police.

MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. We're here to investigate a murder.

SCULLY: I'm going to have to ask you to remain at a distance, please, sir.

BROTHER OAKLEY: Your weapons are forbidden here. We can outlast you at this spot. You're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed to our Council. You'll have them again, as you leave.

MULDER: We can't do that.

SISTER ABIGAIL: Please. I'm Sister Abby. This is Brother Oakley. We're all saddened by what has happened in your world, but it does not concern us. Up here, no one kills another - ever.

SCULLY: We just want to have a few questions answered.

SISTER ABIGAIL: It is your weapons that are unwelcome here, not you. Come and pray with us, be one of us, and you'll see that we harm no one. Please relinquish your weapons. (Scully and Mulder exhange a glance) Please.

(After several moments, Mulder nods and he and Scully remove the clips from their guns and hand the clips to the Kindred.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Now there is no reason to be afraid.

(Mulder and Scully walk with the Kindred back to their house. On the way, they see members working in a hayfield, chopping wood and hanging out clothes. They enter the dining room in the main house.)

BROTHER OAKLEY: Come. Sit.

(Mulder, Scully and eight members of the Kindred, including Brother Andrew, sit around the table.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Let us pray as one. We who are separate give thanks for our alloted time in this world. We ask for strength that we may bring forth the bounty that God has provided.

(As they pray, one brother is coughing, and Scully and Andrew exchange an awkward glance.)

ALL: Amen.

SISTER ABIGAIL: We pray for the day of the coming, the moment of our release.

ALL: Amen.

SISTER ABIGAIL: Let us eat.

(Food is served.)

MULDER: I was wondering if we might ask a few questions. We're looking for someone we believe may have come from here.

SCULLY: We have pictures.

SISTER ABIGAIL: We do not allow pictures.

SCULLY: A crime has been committed. We have certain questions that we need answered, if you'll forgive us.

BROTHER ANDREW: What are these pictures?

SCULLY: Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have committed a murder.

BROTHER ANDREW: Where was this crime committed?

SCULLY: In a hotel in Washington, DC.

MULDER: If we can arrange for you to look at the video tape, maybe you can identify the individual.

BROTHER ANDREW: How much violence has this person caused in your world?

MULDER: Five murders, so far.

SCULLY: And may kill again, which is why we need your help.

MULDER: Has anyone left here recently?

BROTHER WILTON: (slamming the table with his hand) Your world does not interest us. We have no need for your violence or your questions. I've said what is needed. They have no right to be here at this time.

(Sister Abigail, at the other end of the table from Brother Wilton, stands.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Brother Wilton, stand. (he does) Before we can accept any man's person, we must accept our own. And I ask, who can stand in your sight when once you are angry. I am ashamed to lift up my face, and I shall not be ashamed in this evil time. Make atonements for this wrath, Brother Wilton.

(Brother Wilton looks downward.)

MULDER: That's all right. We didn't take any offense.

BROTHER ANDREW: Anger, as violence, is not tolerated. Our brother must be admonished.

(The brother who was coughing earlier is now gagging, grasping his throat.)

SCULLY: He can't breathe.

SISTER ABIGAIL: He does not need your help.

SCULLY: He's choking to death!

(Scully stands and moves around the table to assist the man.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Remove Brother Aaron from the dining hall.

(One of the brothers grabs Scully by the arm to stop her, while several brothers lift Brother Aaron and carry him out of the room.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: We did not invite you here to interfere.

BROTHER ANDREW: We take care of our own.




SCENE 7
A DANCE CLUB, THE SAME ONE AS IN THE TEASER
(A young man [Marty] approaches a blonde woman.)

MARTY (MALE): Would you like to dance?

BLONDE WOMAN: Not right now. (He takes her hand) Look, I'm really not interested, OK?

MARTY (MALE): Just one dance?

(As the man strokes her hand, the woman's expression changes and she smiles at him.)

BLONDE WOMAN: Hi.

MARTY (MALE): One dance?

(He takes her hand and she follows him to the dance floor.)




SCENE 8
NEAR THE KINDRED'S PROPERTY
(It is night, and members of the Kindred, carrying lanterns, have led Mulder and Scully into the woods.)

BROTHER WILTON: It's a mile to your car. Stay in the path.

MULDER: Thanks for your cooperation.

(Mulder and Scully leave the group, each carrying a lantern. They walk toward the car, now out of sight of the group.)

MULDER: The Addams family finds religion.

SCULLY: Take me back to the 20th century.

MULDER: You believe all that back there, Scully?

SCULLY: Believe all what?

MULDER: All that "we take care of our own" business?

SCULLY: Well, they better take care of their own or that man at the dinner table is a dead man.

MULDER: I think it was all an elaborate act.

SCULLY: What? The choking?

MULDER: No, all this simple life, living from abundance crap. These people know something, Scully. You can see it in their eyes - the way they look at one another.

SCULLY: Do you think they know who the murderer is?

MULDER: Did you notice how they managed not to answer a single question of ours? And that outburst at the table was right on cue. Somehow, they got us to answer their questions. Did you ask yourself why there weren't any children around?

SCULLY: I know, that was odd.

(They've stopped along the path.)

MULDER: You want to know what was really odd? You know those pictures we saw down in the store in Steveston today, the ones from the thirties? I swear I saw some of those same faces at the dinner table tonight.

SCULLY: These people have probably been intermarrying for years.

MULDER: Maybe. Maybe not everything is as black and white as it appears to be.

(Mulder turns off his lantern.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I'm going to go back for a little look-see.

(Scully turns off her lantern and follows. As they get back to the property, they see that the main house is dark. They hear a distant chanting noise.)

MULDER: Maybe they went to the movies. Do you hear that?

SCULLY: Uh-huh.

(They follow the noise and see a group of people carry lanterns and chanting. They quietly approach as the group goes into a barn and closes the door behind them. Mulder and Scully creep to the barn and peer through spaces in the barn wall. They see a solemn procession, with members carrying the motionless body of Brother Aaron, the one who was choking earlier. A horse near the barn wall becomes agitated, and several members look around warily as part of the group goes through a cellar door in the barn. The rest go back out of the barn.)

SCULLY: What do you think?

MULDER: I think I want to see what's in that cellar.

(Mulder goes around to the door while Scully stays. Through the wall, she sees Mulder enter, walk to the cellar door and enter. Just then, Brother Andrew startles her, placing his hand on her shoulder from behind.)




SCENE 9
STILL OUTSIDE THE BARN
BROTHER ANDREW: Come with me. I can give you information.

(Scully rises and follows him.)

(Mulder has entered the cellar and is walking down a narrow tunnel. As he nears the chanting noise, he stops and observes though a hole in the wall. Members of the kindred are in a cave-like opening.)

(Brother Andrew and Scully enter a room in the house.)

BROTHER ANDREW: I know who did it.

SCULLY: The murders?

BROTHER ANDREW: You've heard our prayers. You've seen how we live our beliefs. I want you to find this killer. I want you to find him for me. He was my best friend.

SCULLY: What's his name?

BROTHER ANDREW: Brother Martin. I called him Marty.

(Back in the cellar, Mulder watches the others perform a ceremony around Brother Aaron's body. They mix spring water with clay material and rub the mixture onto his body.)

(In the house, Scully and Brother Andrew are in a darkened room, illuminated by a single lantern.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Marty was different.

SCULLY: What do you mean, different?

BROTHER ANDREW: How does he kill?

SCULLY: We're not sure. All of the victims died of cardiac arrest.

BROTHER ANDREW: He poisons them, doesn't he?

SCULLY: Maybe, how do you know that?

(Andrew wedges a chair under the door to block it. Scully shows some apprehension.)

BROTHER ANDREW: I need to show you something ... something about Marty.

(Back in the cellar, the group lifts Brother Aaron's body and leaves it in the cellar, although Mulder cannot see where they put it. They then head back out. After they leave, Mulder moves into the main opening of the cave.)

(In the house, Andrew has brought out a stack of magazines covered in a black cloth. He shows them to Scully.)

BROTHER ANDREW: We found them out on route 44. We were wandering. Marty and I used to do that - explore the edges of our world. Someone must have left them for garbage. They are garbage.

(Scully has looked through the magazines. One of them was entitled "Adventurer", another looks like "Bazaar".)

SCULLY: Why did you keep them?

BROTHER ANDREW: It was Martin who kept them. Some of what I saw in the magazines ... some of it was beautiful, but most of it I didn't like. It was garish. But Martin - Marty - he couldn't get enough. He liked even the paper it was printed on - slick. Marty was captured by your world. He left us to become one of you.

(In the cave, Mulder samples the clay mixture and examines the clay table that Brother Aaron's body was on. He also sees several holes in the clay wall, one of which has a light behind it and a spongy cover on the opening. He hears voices. Grabbing a lantern, he hurries back toward the entrance but sees that people are coming back into the cellar. He runs back into the main chamber and dives into one of the darkened holes in the wall just as several men enter.)

KINDRED MAN #1: Brother Wilton! The woman has returned.

BROTHER WILTON: Where is she?

KINDRED MAN #1: With Andrew, in the main house.

BROTHER WILTON: What about the other one?

KINDRED MAN #1: He's missing.

BROTHER WILTON: Come.

(They leave. Mulder, who has overheard their conversation, looks around where he has been hiding and sees Brother Aaron's body covered in the clay material. His hair seems longer and darker. As Mulder watches, Aaron's eyes open, startling him.)

(Scully and Andrew are still in the house.)

SCULLY: You said Marty was different.

BROTHER ANDREW: Yes.

SCULLY: How? How did he kill his victims?

BROTHER ANDREW: I could be banished.

SCULLY: Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the barn tonight?

(Andrew walks to Scully and takes her hand, rubbing it with his thumb.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

(Outside, Mulder has left the barn and runs next to a fence, near the house. He sees a light on in the house.)

MULDER: (loud whisper) Scully ...

(There is no answer, and Mulder heads toward the house. Inside, Andrew is still stroking Scully's hand and reaches to touch her face. Scully's expression is blank.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Marty is different. We're all different.

(He moves closer and nuzzles her neck.)

SCULLY: Oh ... oh.

(Scully's body goes limp and Andrew has no difficulty pushing her down on the bed and laying on top of her. The doorknob starts rattling.)

MULDER: (in the hallway) Scully?

(Mulder breaks through the door and sees them on the bed.)

MULDER: Get off of her!

(He grabs Andrew and shoves him aside, then lifts Scully, who is still limp, off the bed and helps her out of the room. Moments later, they exit the house, with Scully now walking by herself but still dazed. They encounter a group of the Kindred as they come out the door.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: I asked you not to interfere.

(They all stare at each other for several seconds. Sister Abigail stands aside, clearing a path for them to leave. Mulder nods. Scully is still dazed, and Mulder leads her away by the hand. The Kindred go into the house, as Mulder and Scully get out of hearing range. Mulder has his arm around Scully, who is still walking stiffly.)

MULDER: What the hell were you doing back there?

SCULLY: (weak voice) I don't know.

MULDER: You don't know?

SCULLY: No.

(Scully stops and stumbles a few steps back, coughing.)

MULDER: You all right?

(Scully bends over and becomes nauseous.)




SCENE 10
THE DANCE CLUB
(A young man, Michael, is on the phone as the loud music pounds in the background. As he speaks, a young woman, the same one from the opening scene, approaches and touches his hand.)

MICHAEL: (to phone) I wasn't ignoring you. No. Of course I saw you, I just didn't recognize you, that's all. (to the young woman) Excuse me, I'm having a conversation ...

(She moves to the other size of him and starts to stroke his other hand. He slowly turns to look at her. He puts the phone down and she then leads him away by the hand.)




SCENE 11
NEAR STEVESTON
(Mulder has stopped at a diner and brings two cups of coffee back to the car, giving one to Scully.)

SCULLY: Thanks.

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Better ... a little embarrassed, actually.

MULDER: Why? You don't remember any of it.

SCULLY: It's like I don't remember ...

MULDER: Why didn't you get out of there before he ...

SCULLY: Because he told me he knew who the killer was.

MULDER: How did you know he wasn't the killer?

SCULLY: I believed him.

(Mulder sighs as he drinks his coffee.)

SCULLY: So what did you see down in the cellar?

MULDER: Just Brother what's-his-name buried in some gopher hole in the wall. Buried alive.

SCULLY: How do you know he was alive?

MULDER: Because I was in there with him. And his face was ... was different. Even his hair, it was almost feminine. It was like he was going through some kind of a transformation.

SCULLY: Changing sexes?

MULDER: That would explain the hotel security video.

SCULLY: So you're saying these people ...

MULDER: I know what I saw, Scully. And I saw you about to do the wild thing with some stranger.

(Scully stares at him for a few moments.)

SCULLY: Think he was trying to kill me?

MULDER: Maybe it's the sex that kills.

SCULLY: Well, if he was trying to kill me, why did they let us go?

MULDER: I don't know.

(He starts the car.)




SCENE 12
A PARKED CAR
(Michael and the young woman are making out in the front seat. She is sitting on his lap, kissing him. A figure with a flashlight approaches and knocks on the window.)

COP: All right. Let's break it up. (Michael groans) Out of the car.

MARTY (FEMALE): (getting out of the car) Sorry, officer.

COP: (to Michael, still in the car) You, too. (to Marty) You a pro?

MARTY (FEMALE): Pro?

(Michael starts groaning and gasping in pain. The cop hears him and looks over to see what's wrong.)

COP: What?

(Marty flattens the cop with a left hook to the jaw. As Michael continues to gasp in the car, the cop gets to his knees and Marty, who now looks like a man, delivers an uppercut to the cop's jaw, knocking him out. Michael wipes away the fog on the driver's window and looks out of the car, seeing a man staring back at him. The man runs away as a wide-eyed Michael coughs.)




SCENE 13
A HOSPITAL
(Michael is lying in a hospital bed, being questioned by Mulder and Scully.)

MICHAEL: On a scale of 1 to 10, she was a kind 3. But there was something about her.

SCULLY: Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other manner?

MICHAEL: Her touch was ... electric. But after that, I remember only vaguely.

MULDER: What do you remember?

MICHAEL: Nothing, actually.

MULDER: Try to remember, Michael. The policeman at the scene supports what you said, but maybe there was something ... unusual about this woman. Something you wouldn't feel comfortable telling the police on the record.

MICHAEL: But this is off the record?

MULDER: Absolutely.

SCULLY: What did you see, Michael?

MICHAEL: After she left the car and she was fighting with the cop, I saw her in her clothes and she looked like ... (nervous laugh) ... she looked like a man.

(Mulder and Scully exchange glances.)

SCULLY: She was a man.

MICHAEL: Hustling in the club scene used to be so simple. (to Mulder) That's off the record.

MULDER: Scout's honor.

(Mulder and Scully are walking down a hallway in the hospital.)

SCULLY: Well, I can't rule out the possiblity that who we're looking for is a transvestite.

MULDER: I think Don Juan in there knows the difference between the male and the female of the species.

SCULLY: I just don't want us to ignore the obvious. I mean, how else could you explain a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop? She was a he.

(An agent runs toward them.)

AGENT #1: Agent Mulder? Agent Scully? The credit card that was stolen from the last victim in DC was just used to order takeout in a hotel downtown, about 8 blocks from here.




SCENE 14
A HOTEL ROOM
MARTY (FEMALE): It was always forbidden, but after the first time I couldn't help myself. Touching a human man, or a woman, is as powerful for me as it was for you.

(Mulder and Scully are entering the hotel.)

SCULLY: This is Agent Scully requesting police backup and additional agents at 771 Catherine Street. It's the Hotel Catherine.

(Back in the hotel room, as Marty continues to talk, we see that she is talking to an apparently lifeless man lying in the bed.)

MARTY (FEMALE): Your world offers pleasures - pleasures we don't know because we're different. But you know that now. The others will punish me for what I've done. They'll find me, because the day is coming and they won't leave without me.

(Mulder and Scully have arrived on the floor and run down the hallway. Scully finds the room first.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Mulder runs to the door and they draw their weapons and take positions. Mulder knocks on the door.)

MULDER: Delivery!

(There is no answer. Mulder signals that he's going to break in and Scully steps in front of the door.)

MULDER: (breaking in door) FBI! FBI! Clear! Stay down!

(They don't see anyone inside. Scully goes into the adjoining room and finds the man on the bed.)

SCULLY: Dead body!

(Marty, who was hiding behind a curtain, emerges and hits Scully on the head from behind. She groans and falls to the floor. Marty runs back out into the hall.)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: (from the floor, weakly) I'm OK.

(Mulder runs out into the hall. He finds the next door open and starts to enter. From inside, Marty strikes him in the face, knocking him to the floor in the hall. As Mulder watches, the female Marty morphs into a male. Mulder reaches for his gun, but the male Marty kicks him in the face, kicks the gun down the hall and runs away, wearing only socks, a sweatshirt and underwear.)

(Back in the first room, Scully gets up and runs into the hall, seeing Mulder lying there, dazed.)

MULDER: (groggily) Scully. Down the stairs ...

(She jumps over him and down the stairs at the end of the hall. She bursts out into the alley below but doesn't see anyone. As she moves through the alley, she hears a noise and sees shadows appear on the side of one of the buildings. Suddenly, the male Marty runs toward her.)

SCULLY: Federal agent, I'm armed! (Marty stops) Back away!

(Suddenly, Marty is tackled by a figure dressed in black. He is surrounded by the Kindred, including Brother Andrew. They get him to his feet.)

SCULLY: Step away! Step away!

(Andrew turns to Scully and walks toward her, while the others hold Marty behind him.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Please. Don't hurt him.

SCULLY: No. Step away. (Andrew continues to approach her) I'm armed.

(Andrew continues to block the others from Scully's line of fire. As he gets close, she starts to lower her gun. Mulder comes out of the hotel and into the alley.)

MULDER: Scully!

(Scully turns to him, and Andrew knocks her gun out of her hand, then strikes her in the face. She falls. As Mulder runs to her aid, shadows on the building wall move away and the Kindred disappear as mysteriously as they appeared.)

(Later, there are police cars in the alley and an agent approaches Scully and Mulder.)

AGENT #2:MULDER: What if they did get through? There's only place they'd hide.




SCENE 15
THE KINDRED PROPERTY NEAR STEVESTON
(The next morning, several 4-wheel drive police vehicles approach. Mulder, Scully, the agent and others emerge and start to search the area. Scully heads to the house and finds no one in the dining area.)

SCULLY: They're gone.

(Mulder has run to the barn and opens the door to the cellar. He finds a solid clay wall behind it. The agent approaches from behind.)

AGENT #2: We found something in the hayfield.

(Mulder and Scully are walking through the hayfield.)

SCULLY: I don't understand. How can they just disappear? They have no means of transportation.

MULDER: No earthly means of transportation.

(They come to a large "crop circle" in the field.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
MARYLAND MARINE BANK
5:55 PM
(SCULLY opens a briefcase on a bank counter. Pretends to fill out a deposit slip. AGENT JACK WILLIS, attractive, late 30’s stands near her. He is restless, looking around.)

SCULLY: (quietly, to WILLIS) Relax, they’ll be here.

WILLIS: Bank’s going to close in five minutes.

SCULLY: Sure it wasn’t a bogus tip?

WILLIS: No. It’s real. I’ve been on this long enough. I know the difference. Besides, I can feel it. I can feel them. I’m inside their heads.

SCULLY: (warning tease) Just as long as you keep yours.

WILLIS: (smiles) Message received, Agent Scully, loud and clear. (softly into intercom) Position five. It’s Agent Willis. Do you copy?

(There is a gun in SCULLY’s briefcase. She closes the case.)

(SAME TIME: Outside the bank in a car, DUPRE and LULA, hard and rough looking, 30’s. LULA is in driver’s seat. DUPRE loads gun. LULA watches the bank.)

DUPRE: What, are you nervous?

LULA: Nope. I just don’t want our luck to run out.

DUPRE: Baby, you are my luck. No matter what happens, whenever I look up at the stars I know you’re going to be looking up at the same ones.

LULA: The same ones, baby.

(DUPRE kisses LULA passionately. We see a tattoo on his arm.)

DUPRE: You make every day like New Year’s Eve.

(Wearing hockey mask, holding rifle, DUPRE busts into the bank, yelling.)

DUPRE: Get down! Get down on the ground! I want everyone on the ground now! NOW! Get down! You too --- on the floor! On the floor! I’ll execute every one of you!

(People are screaming and panicking. DUPRE shoves a bag to a teller.)

DUPRE: Put the money in the bag now! Move! Shut up and do it!

(WILLIS pulls his gun and aims it at DUPRE. SCULLY, slightly behind WILLIS also holds her gun on DUPRE.)

WILLIS: Dupre! Drop the gun! FBI! Drop the gun, NOW!

(Pause. All quiet. DUPRE lowers his gun. WILLIS relaxes slightly. Then pulls it up again quickly and shoots WILLIS in the chest. Calmly, SCULLY shoots DUPRE 3 times. DUPRE falls, and the hockey mask goes skidding across the floor.)




SCENE 2
(Later. Hospital. WILLIS is in ER getting defibrillated. SCULLY stands close, very concerned.)

DOCTOR: I need more saline in here, stat.

NURSE: Up to 360, now.

INTERN: 11 minutes, 55 seconds. Clear.

SCULLY: Come on, Jack.

INTERN: He’s been flatlined for over twelve minutes.

DOCTOR: Another amp of EPI and we’ll go again at 360. Clear.

(No response.)

NURSE: Still no pulse.

DOCTOR: We’ve done all we can. I’m sorry.

INTERN: You want me to pronounce?

SCULLY: No. You can’t give up on him.

DOCTOR: It’s been over 13 minutes. He’s dead.

SCULLY: Go up to 400.

DOCTOR: We lost him. Let him go.

SCULLY: I’m a doctor. Go up to 400, or I’ll do it myself.

DOCTOR: Clear.

(As they jolt WILLIS, DUPRE’s sheet covered body in the other room jerks.)

SCULLY: Give him another amp of EPI intracardial and go up to 400 again. (They stare at her.) Do it.

DOCTOR: Clear.

SCULLY: Again. Come on, Jack.

DOCTOR: Clear.

(Monitor begins beeping and registering vitals.)

DOCTOR: (amazed) We got a rhythm. Don’t ask me how, but he’s back. BP’s 80 over 50 and climbing. 90 over 50 …

(SCULLY looks relieved. Camera pans over to the tattoo on DUPRE’s limp right arm.)




SCENE 3
BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL
12:51 AM
TWO DAYS LATER
(Hospital room. WILLIS is lying in bed attached to machines. His eyes suddenly open. We see only his legs as he gets up, goes to another room and dresses in the man’s clothes. A nurse comes to check on the patient. WILLIS hides in the bathroom, ready to garrote the nurse with a strip of rubber. After she leaves, he catches sight of himself in the bathroom mirror. He touches his face in wonder. Has flash of WILLIS being shot.)

(WILLIS goes to the morgue and opens a drawer and looks at DUPRE’s body. The body is stiff. He tries to pull the wedding ring off of DUPRE’s finger, but it sticks. He opens a drawer and gets out a pair of bone cutters and we hear a snap as he cuts off one of DUPRE’s fingers.)




SCENE 4
(Hospital, next day. MULDER joins SCULLY in the morgue. Crime scene procedures underway.)

SCULLY: Any word from Willis?

MULDER: Still missing. He hasn't been home or checked in with the office. I heard something on the way down about a mutilation?

SCULLY: Yeah. Three fingers on Dupre's left hand were severed by surgical shears. We lifted prints. They're Willis’.

MULDER: You said he was chasing this guy for almost a year?

SCULLY: Yeah, he lived the case. It was all he thought about, talked about.

MULDER: What are you thinking?

SCULLY: That maybe this is some kind of post-trauma psychosis. Like the way soldiers sometimes mutilate the body of a dead enemy.

MULDER: That still doesn't explain why he would just vanish. Dupre's partner-- who was she? (reads a chart) Lula Phillips.

SCULLY: They met while she was serving a ten year sentence for manslaughter at the Women's Correctional Facility of Maryland.

MULDER: He was a prison guard.

SCULLY: Until the warden found out about their secret. According to Lula's cell mate they carried on quite a torrid romance.

MULDER: It says here she was released on May 2, 1993.

SCULLY: One week before the first robbery at Annapolis Savings and Loan. The 65-year-old female teller was pistol-whipped. Died from a massive subdural hemorrhage all because she didn’t put the money in the bag fast enough.

MULDER: Lovely couple.

SCULLY: Well, apparently they took turns --- one pulling a job while the other one drove getaway. Between the two of them, they’ve killed seven people and gotten away with close to $100,000.

MULDER: That’s a lot of money now that she doesn’t have to split it two ways.

SCULLY: Well, we’re putting her face out there --- local newspapers, America’s Most Wanted. (notices Mulder not paying attention, still reading the file) Am I boring you?

MULDER: They were married.

SCULLY: Yeah. Last May in Atlantic City. So what?

MULDER: I don’t think this was a simple necrophiliac mutilation. Willis sliced and diced those fingers to get at the wedding ring.

(MULDER looks down at DUPRE’s face and compares it to the file picture.)




SCENE 5
(DUPRE and LULA’s apartment. WILLIS arrives, breaks the door window, unlocks the door, and enters.)

WILLIS: Anybody here? Lula? (Sound of a plane overhead.) Baby, baby. baby. (He goes to the fireplace and feels around inside, is disappointed.) Damn.

(He looks in wonder as DUPRE’s tattoo forms on his arm.)




SCENE 6
(X-Files office. MULDER and SCULLY looking at evidence from the morgue.)

SCULLY: It's a left thumbprint.

MULDER: You can see by these two bifurcations here that whoever held that cleaver was using his left hand.

SCULLY: What do you mean, "whoever"? It was Willis.

MULDER: Willis is right-handed. I checked his pistol grip at the armory. But all the bank surveillance tapes show that Dupre is left-handed.

SCULLY: I'm not sure where you're going.

MULDER: How long did Willis flatline before you revived him?

SCULLY: Just over 13 minutes.

MULDER: This is the EKG strip that recorded his cardiac activity at the time. Now, *in your medical opinion,* what does that look like?

SCULLY: It could be anything – an instrument malfunction, electrical overload.

MULDER: (leading tone) But what does it *look* like?

SCULLY: (pause) Two heartbeats.

MULDER: Now, you say Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest at the exact same time, right?

SCULLY: Right.

MULDER: Which means for minutes, both men were technically dead.

SCULLY: Technically, but we resuscitated Willis.

MULDER: You resuscitated his body.

SCULLY: (warning) Mulder.

MULDER: Two men died in that crash room, Scully. One man came back. The question is … which one?




SCENE 7
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND
DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
(MULDER and SCULLY are in the office of PROFESSOR VARNES, energetic, 60ish. MULDER watches SCULLY listen to PROFESSOR VARNES.)

PROF. VARNES: What can you tell me about near-death experiences, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: The usual stuff – the tunnel, the light, people rising up and viewing their own bodies.

PROF. VARNES: And as a scientist, how do you account for the phenomenon?

SCULLY: Some sort of disassociative, hallucinatory activity.

PROF. VARNES: (chuckles) Did you know that half of all adults who have had a near-death experience can not wear a watch? The increased electrical activity in their bodies renders the watches on their wrists inoperable. Now, I know this sounds kooky, but as any biologist will tell you, when cells die and genetic material begins to unfold, a tremendous charge of energy is released.

MULDER: Dr. Varnes believes this burst of energy is responsible for the transformational nature of the experience.

PROF. VARNES: People do return from the event profoundly changed.

SCULLY: Changed how?

PROF. VARNES: Personality shifts, perceived psychic abilities, increased zest for life.

MULDER: What about the negative consequences?

PROF. VARNES: Well, they’re rare, but apparently, in the process of dying there is a window of time during which the body is vulnerable.

SCULLY: I don’t understand.

PROF. VARNES: Well, there was a pilot in my support group who died in a commuter plane crash along with his three passengers. This was a few years ago. He recalls floating up in a brilliant aura of light and then feeling an overwhelming need to return to his body. He was revived in the ambulance on the way to the hospital --- the only survivor. It was soon after that that the visions started. Visions of making love to his wife but in ways and places that weren’t in his memory. Now, it turns out that one of the dead passengers on the plane was having an affair with his wife. The dead passenger’s memory, his consciousness had survived through the pilot.

SCULLY: What happened?

PROF. VARNES: Well, the pilot became increasingly disoriented – a schizophrenic, his doctor claims – until one day he strangled his wife with an extension cord. (smiles and walks away)

MULDER: That’s a nice story.

SCULLY: (sighs)

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY coming down the stairs.)

SCULLY: I don’t discount the near-death experience because it can be explained empirically by stimulation of the temporal lobe.

MULDER: I sense a big "but" coming.

SCULLY: It’s my still best guess Jack’s disappearance can be explained in psychological, not supernatural, terms.

MULDER: For instance?

SCULLY: The stress of the case, the trauma of being shot….. Jack’s personality.

MULDER: How well do you know him?

SCULLY: (forced casual) We dated … for almost a year. He was my instructor at the academy.

(SCULLY keeps walking, MULDER stops and looks at her.)

MULDER: The plot thickens.

SCULLY: (walking back toward MULDER, remembering fondly) We even had the same birthday. We used to celebrate in some dive in Statford that had a slanting pool table. But it was always so hard for Jack to relax. It was impossible for him really. He was always so intense, so relentlessly determined.

MULDER: Do you believe he’s predisposed to this type of psychotic episode?

SCULLY: I believe it’s a long way from saying Jack had a near-death experience to saying his body’s been inhabited by Warren Dupre. (walks down the hall, looks back over her shoulder) A long way.




SCENE 8
(TOMMY’s low rent, messy apartment. WILLIS breaks in, grabs TOMMY’s gun and holds it on TOMMY who is in bed watching TV, no sound.)

TOMMY: What the hell?

WILLIS: You’re such a creature of habit, Tommy.

TOMMY: Who the hell are you?

WILLIS: Get out of bed.

TOMMY: I ain’t got no clothes on.

WILLIS: Get out of bed. I don’t want to shoot you lying down.

TOMMY: Who are you, the rent man? ‘Cause I’m all paid up. I swear, I’m not kidding you. Come on, you can go ask Cosmo.

WILLIS: (getting a soda out of the refrigerator and drinking it) Shut up. Where is she?

TOMMY: Where’s who?

WILLIS: Your sister.

TOMMY: Lula? I don’t know. I was waiting to see her on the news. (points at new story on the silent television) What I tell you? Check it out.

(WILLIS tries to adjust the volume.)

TOMMY: The sound’s busted. Looks like they’ll find her before you do, pal.

WILLIS: Is that what you think? That’s not what I think. (touches screen image of LULA reverently, then turns off the TV) I miss her, Tommy. I miss her so bad. That’s why I came back.

TOMMY: Do I know you from somewhere?

WILLIS: Everything I see, I see her.

(WILLIS’s shirt is covered with blood.)

TOMMY: Jesus, man, you’re bleeding.

WILLIS: (looking at blood on his hands) Even ugliness is beautiful because of her. (aims gun at TOMMY)

TOMMY: (scared) Okay, what are you doing?

WILLIS: You set us up, Tommy. You sold us out to the FBI.

TOMMY: (realizing, amazed) Dupre?

(Gunshot.)

(Commercial 1)




SCENE 9
CRIME SCENE
DESMOND ARMS RESIDENT HOTEL
(TOMMY’s apartment next day. Crime scene. MULDER looks around while SCULLY talks to AGENT BRUSKIN.)

AGENT BRUSKIN: Neighbors heard a gunshot, but nobody bothered to check it out. The patrol guys responded this morning to an anonymous 911 and found him here, except the rats found him first. The victim’s name was Thomas Phillips.

SCULLY: That’s Lula’s brother.

AGENT BRUSKIN: Well, there’s not a lot of family resemblance left between the rats and the .45 he took in the face. (puts a piece of gum in his mouth) Oh, I hate this nicotine stuff.

SCULLY: What’s his story?

AGENT BRUSKIN: He’s single. He’s lived here alone for the past seven months. A few priors, small stuff, mostly – B and E, narcotics possession. Nothing like his big sister.

MULDER: Was the television turned on when they found him?

AGENT BRUSKIN: No. Why?

MULDER: I don’t think Tommy was much a reader since he doesn’t seem to have owned any books and from the position of the body, I’d say maybe he was watching the tube when he was shot.

OFFICER DANIELS: Print kit’s right over there. Knock yourself out.

(Noise at front door as WILLIS confronts OFFICER DANIELS at the door. MULDER and SCULLY turn and look.)

WILLIS: Out of my way, Ace.

OFFICER DANIELS: Regulations state to gain access to a crime scene, you got to show me some ID.

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Looks like you were right.

SCULLY: Excuse me. (goes to door) Jack…

(WILLIS looks at her and has flashback of her firing the shots that killed DUPRE.)

SCULLY: (to OFFICER DANIELS) Is there a problem here?

WILLIS: No, I just don’t have any ID. And would you tell this gentleman who I am?

SCULLY: It’s all right, Officer. This is Agent Jack Willis. He’s with the Violent Crimes Section of the Washington Bureau. (quietly leading WILLIS through the door) Come on. Let’s talk out here.

OFFICER DANIELS: (letting WILLIS pass) I was just doing my job.

SCULLY: (quietly to WILLIS) For God’s sake, Willis, what happened? Half the Bureau’s been looking for you. Where have you been?

WILLIS: I don’t know. I just … wasn’t myself. I just kinda woke up out in the street.

SCULLY: I’m taking you back to the hospital. You’re in no shape to be ---

WILLIS: No, no, no way! I’m staying right here.

SCULLY: You’re not ready to be here.

WILLIS: Who says?

SCULLY: Jack. You’re recovering from a major trauma. It’s a miracle you’re even able to walk around.

WILLIS: Look. This is Tommy Phillip’s place, right?

SCULLY: Jack …

WILLIS: Let me just ask you something. Was he killed with a .45?

SCULLY: As a matter of fact he was.

WILLIS: He was. That’s Lula’s weapon of choice. I know these people. I’ve been after them for a long time. We’re halfway there.

SCULLY: (reluctantly giving in) You did open the book on this one.

WILLIS: Yeah. And I’m gonna be there when it’s closed. (slams his fist into his palm)

SCULLY: All right. But as a colleague and as a friend I’m recommending you undergo a full medical evaluation --- physical and psychological.

WILLIS: All right, fair enough.

(They join the others in the bedroom.)

MULDER: Jack, good to see you back among the living.

(MULDER shakes WILLIS’ hand, but watches him warily.)

WILLIS: It’s good to be back.

AGENT BRUSKIN: (shaking WILLIS’ hand) Jack.

WILLIS: So what do we got here?

AGENT BRUSKIN: Mulder here found a print on the TV – a partial oblique – and it’s not the victim’s.

WILLIS: (looking at MULDER) Good work, Agent Mulder. I’m impressed.

(MULDER watches WILLIS cross to the TV.)




SCENE 10
(FBI indoor shooting range. MULDER, fingers in his ears, comes up behind WILLIS who is shooting the target. WILLIS finishes the clip and pops it out of the gun.)

MULDER: That’s fancy shooting.

WILLIS: Yeah, well, I got to get recertified before they give me my weapon back.

MULDER: (looking at target) Well, by the looks of it, I wouldn’t worry about recertification.

WILLIS: Is there anything else you wanted?

MULDER: Yeah. It’s, uh, Scully’s birthday and I was wondering if you’d sign that for her.

(MULDER places a card on a table and carefully watches WILLIS for a reaction. Hands him a pen. WILLIS is relaxed.)

WILLIS: Sure. Be glad to. I’m always glad to celebrate the good times.

(WILLIS signs the card with his left hand.)

WILLIS: There you go.




SCENE 11
(X-Files office. MULDER tosses the card on SCULLY’s desk.)

MULDER: (smugly) Happy Birthday, Scully.

SCULLY: (confused) You’re two months early.

MULDER: It’s from Willis. I thought you two had the same birthday.

SCULLY: We do.

MULDER: Well, that’s news to him. I asked him to sign it. And he signed it with his left hand. (sits at his desk)

SCULLY: You mean you tested him.

MULDER: Yeah. After I found out that the evidence from the Phillips murder is missing.

SCULLY: What evidence?

MULDER: The print we lifted. Our best lead is gone. Someone stole it before the lab had a chance to take a look at it.

SCULLY: (crossing to MULDER) And you think Willis is responsible?

MULDER: I’m not sure Willis is Willis. (SCULLY sighs and rolls her eyes.) Can you at least accept the possibility that during his near-death experience some kind of psychic transference occurred?

SCULLY: Can’t you accept the possibility that this isn’t an X-File? Aside from the expected level of post-trauma stress, Jack passed both of his evaluations --- physical and psychological. (defensively) Anyway, just because someone forgets a birthday doesn’t mean that he’s been possessed. When I was studying for my medical boards, I forgot my birthday too.

MULDER: Did you forget how to sign your name? This is a copy of the automobile requisition form Willis filed the day before he was shot. Compare the signatures.

(The two signatures are not even close.)

SCULLY: Like I said, Mulder, stress, all right? We both know it can significantly affect someone’s cursive standard. I’m afraid this doesn’t prove a thing.




SCENE 12
(WILLIS at his desk in VCU. Looks through file on the case. Is disturbed by the pictures of his dead body and of LULA. His phone rings.)

WILLIS: (into phone) Agent Willis here.

(WILLIS listens for a moment, then hangs up quickly and crosses to the door. SCULLY crosses over to him.)

SCULLY: Jack. Where are you going?

WILLIS: We got a break. A landlord in Boyle Heights thinks he’s got our girl.

SCULLY: Hotline?

WILLIS: Yeah. Saw her picture in the post office. Here’s the address.

SCULLY: Jack, can I ask you something?

WILLIS: Yeah, sure.

SCULLY: (difficult to ask) The Phillips murder. The print Mulder lifted off the television --- it’s missing.

WILLIS: And?

SCULLY: And … you were carrying the evidence back.

WILLIS: Are you implying something, Agent Scully? I don’t know anything about any missing print. Now, I’m ten minutes from closing the biggest case in my career. Are you coming?




SCENE 13
(Apartment building. WILLIS and SCULLY go up the stairs to apartment 202.)

WILLIS: What’s that apartment number again?

SCULLY: Number 202.

WILLIS: Oh, yeah. (knocks) What’s this guy’s name?

SCULLY: Multrevich.

WILLIS: Multrevich?

(WILLIS knocks at 202. MULTREVICH, large unkempt man, opens the door.)

WILLIS: Mr. Multrevich? I’m from the FBI. Jack Willis. We spoke on the phone.

MULTREVICH: Oh, yeah.

WILLIS: (holds up picture of LULA) Have you ever seen this lady?

MULTREVICH: Yeah. 207. Two days ago. First and last month, cash.

SCULLY: Where’s 207?

MULTREVICH: Down the hallway, around the corner.

SCULLY: All right, Mr. Multrevich, we want you to go back inside your apartment and stay away from the windows.

(MULTREVICH closes the door. WILLIS and SCULLY walk down the hall.)

SCULLY: Where’s our back up? You said you called them, right?

WILLIS: Yeah, they should have been here ten minutes ago. She may be running down a fire escape, or something.

SCULLY: I’m going to call in again.

(LULA opens the door at the end of the hall holding a basket of laundry.)

WILLIS: (sees LULA, grins widely, happy to see her) Look. Hey, that’s her.

(LULA flings the basket to the floor and runs back down the stairs. SCULLY and WILLIS follow LULA down to the basement.)

WILLIS: (desperate) Where is she? Where did she go?

SCULLY: I’ll check back here.

(Separately and silently they search the dark area for about a minute. LULA attacks SCULLY from behind. SCULLY tackles LULA and gets her face down on a mattress.)

SCULLY: Face down! Face down! Hands behind your back. Now!

(SCULLY gets LULA hand cuffed, then still sitting on LULA turns her head to WILLIS who has come up behind them.)

SCULLY: She’s all yours, Jack.

WILLIS: (looking at LULA) Yeah, like a dog on a leash.

(LULA looks up at WILLIS sharply. WILLIS tosses his handcuffs onto the mattress beside SCULLY.)

SCULLY: (warily) I already cuffed her.

WILLIS: They’re for you, Scully. Put them on.

SCULLY: What’s going on, Jack?

WILLIS: (aiming his gun at SCULLY) Put them on, or I’ll blow you in half.

SCULLY: Jack …

WILLIS: Shut up! Put them on.

(SCULLY, staring at Jack, slowly puts the cuffs on her own wrists. WILLIS goes to LULA and tenderly touches her face.)

WILLIS: Come on, baby. Come on, get up, baby. I want to look at you. Your face is all dirty.

LULA: (trying to push him away) Keep your stinking hands off me.

WILLIS: Baby, you ain’t going to believe where I been.

(SCULLY watches them.)




SCENE 14
(LULA and DUPRE’s apartment. WILLIS is talking to LULA who is packing suitcases. SCULLY is handcuffed to the radiator. Her lip is swollen and bloodied)

WILLIS: Sure it’s crazy. You don’t think I know it’s crazy? This isn’t my face, these aren’t my hands, but it’s me in here. And I know you, I know everything about you, baby. Come on, ask me something. Your birthday’s April 7th. Your favorite color is red. Come on. Come on, ask me something else. Come on, ask me.

LULA: (not convinced) Okay. Okay, what did we do after we got married?

WILLIS: (suggestively) Right after?

LULA: After that.

WILLIS: Well, we went down to the beach. I took out my buck knife and I sliced open my palm and then I slit open your palm … (takes her hand) and we let the blood drip down in the water.

LULA: Then what did you say to me?

WILLIS: I said, "This is so we can be married in all the oceans of the world." (kisses her hand) And then I made you a solemn oath … (holds up wedding ring) to never take this ring off my finger. (puts it on) Ever. I mean to keep that promise.

LULA: (shakes her head and pulls away) This is … this is just too weird. I can’t believe it’s really you.

WILLIS: Don’t worry, baby. It won’t make any difference in the dark.

(WILLIS begins kissing her neck. She looks uncomfortable.)




SCENE 15
(MULDER and AGENT BRUSKIN coming out of MULTREVICH’s apartment.)

AGENT BRUSKIN: Thank you sir, we’ll be in touch.

MULTREVICH: When do I get my reward?

AGENT BRUSKIN: We’ll call you.

(MULTREVICH goes back inside.)

AGENT BRUSKIN: Now *I’m* worried. 12 hours with no word. I don’t get it. Why’s their car still sitting out front? Why didn’t Willis call for backup?

MULDER: Because it wasn’t Willis who answered the hot line.

AGENT BRUSKIN: What are you talking about? You heard the recording. It was Willis’ voice.

MULDER: (tense) Forget it, Bruskin.

AGENT BRUSKIN: Plus which, the manager just ID’d him and Scully.

MULDER: (really tense) I said forget it, Bruskin.

(They get out to the car.)

AGENT BRUSKIN: This isn’t one of your X-File theories, is it?

MULDER: It doesn’t matter what I think. We’re still after the same thing. (MULDER’s cell phone rings. He answers it.) Mulder.

VOICE: (on phone) FBI Centrex Operator. Please hold.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.

WILLIS: (voice, on phone) Guess who, Ace?

MULDER: (on phone) Willis?

WILLIS: (on phone) That depends on who you ask, don’t it?

MULDER: (on phone) Where’s Scully?

WILLIS: (on phone) You’re the FBI. You figure it out.

MULDER: (on phone) Let me talk to her.

WILLIS: (on phone) Yeah. Sure. (puts phone to SCULLY’s ear)

SCULLY: (into phone) Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Dana, are you okay?

SCULLY: (into phone) Don’t --- (WILLIS pulls the phone away)

MULDER: (voice, on phone) Dana?

WILLIS: Okay. That’s it. Good-bye. (hangs up)

SCULLY: It’s not going to work, Jack.

WILLIS: You don’t think so?

SCULLY: Bureau policy prohibits negotiating with kidnappers. But you already know that, don’t you, Jack?

WILLIS: Stop calling me that!

SCULLY: Your name is Jack Willis. You were born February 23, 1957. You live at 51 Stanhope ---

WILLIS: My name is Warren James Dupre. And I was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon in the Year of the Rat.

SCULLY: We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens. You taught me how to fish through the ice. It was your parents’ cabin. Jack, try to remember. We drove up in a snowstorm. Come on, Jack.

(WILLIS, breathing heavily, has flashes of driving in snow. Brushes the image away and turns angrily back to SCULLY.)

WILLIS: Don’t think I didn’t see what you did. I was like a little slip of paper up there on that hospital ceiling. I saw everything.

SCULLY: What did you see?

WILLIS: You left me to die on that table while you tried to save your friend!

SCULLY: You *are* my friend.

WILLIS: Too bad he was gone already. I watched him go. I just saw him slip away down that long, black tunnel.

SCULLY: No. We brought you back.

WILLIS: You shot me dead! And then you let me die.

SCULLY: No. You won’t kill me, Jack.

WILLIS: (pushes gun into her side) You call me that one more time I’ll make you stone-cold.

(LULA enters the room.)

LULA: Easy, baby, easy. Not yet. Remember, she’s our ticket.

WILLIS: (taking an empty can of soda from LULA tips it up to drink the last drops) Got any more of this soda?

LULA: You just drank the last of it.

SCULLY: (realization) Soda. How much of that have you had?

WILLIS: What’s it to you?

SCULLY: Jack Willis is diabetic. Which means you’re diabetic. Too much sugar in the system could lead to hyperglycemia.

LULA: Maybe that’s why your stomach’s hurting so bad.

SCULLY: Abdominal pain is the first sign of impending diabetic coma. You need insulin.




SCENE 16
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC
(X-Files office. MULDER, alone, listening to WILLIS’s field notes and looking through the file.)

WILLIS: (voice on tape) I feel myself getting into their heads and I'm scared by what I'm feeling. The intoxicating freedom that comes from disconnecting action and consequence. Theirs is a world where nothing matters but their own needs, their own impossible appetites and while the pleasure they derive from acts of violence is clearly sexual, it also speaks to what Warden Jackson called their operatic devotion to each other. It's a love affair I almost envy.

(MULDER’s beeper goes off. He looks at it.)




SCENE 17
(Later, MULDER, using a detailed map, is briefing a room full of agents.)

MULDER: Katensville PD just reported a drugstore was broken into right here on the corner of Old Forge Road and Madison and I’m betting that Scully is somewhere within this five mile radius.

AGENT BRUSKIN: Am I missing something?

MULDER: 200 units of NPH insulin were taken with a box of syringes. Willis is diabetic.

AGENT BRUSKIN: Get me a census report. Let’s see how many households we’re talking about.




SCENE 18
(LULA and DUPRE’s apartment. SCULLY, released from the radiator, empties a bag of insulin bottles and syringes on the table and begins opening a package.)

WILLIS: (desperate, weak voice) Quick,. quick, quick. My legs are starting to go numb.

SCULLY: Hold on.

(LULA draws gun on SCULLY and pushes the insulin to the floor.)

WILLIS: What the hell …?

LULA: (to SCULLY) Drop the needle.

SCULLY: Without this medicine, he dies.

LULA: Yes, so you said. Now, put it down … unless you want me to put you down with it.

(SCULLY drops the medicine.)

WILLIS: What the hell are you doing, Lula? I need that medicine.

LULA: You still haven’t figured it out, have you?

WILLIS: Figured what out?

LULA: It wasn’t my brother who set you up.

WILLIS: (realizing) You?

LULA: Yeah, me. How do you think I got away so clean, huh? The minute you stepped into that bank I was out of there. I got the money, and I got rid of you. At least I thought I did.

(LULA steps on the bottle of insulin, shattering it. WILLIS moans in pain.)




SCENE 19
(FBI headquarters. Phone rings.)

PHONE AGENT: (on phone) Tactical. (listens a moment, then to room) This is it.

(MULDER takes the phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

LULA: (on phone, voice) Listen carefully.

MULDER: (on phone) Where’s Willis?

LULA: (on phone, voice) Oh, he's lying around here somewhere.

MULDER: (on phone) Let me talk to Scully.

LULA: (on phone) Not this time.

MULDER: (on phone) We don’t deal unless we know Scully is alive.

LULA: (on phone) She’s alive. She’s not happy, but she’s alive.

MULDER: (on phone, threatening) You listen to me --- you lay one hand on Scully, and so help me, God ----

LULA: (on phone) If I were you, I’d stop talking and start passing around the collection hat ‘cause if you ever want to see Scully again it’s going to cost you a million dollars. Have it by this time tomorrow. I'll tell you when and where. (hangs up)

PHONE AGENT: (who has been tracing the call) We got it. It’s a 202 number.

AGENT BRUSKIN: Great. Get the address.

MULDER: (looking at paper, then crumpling it) Forget it. It’s Scully’s cellular number. They’re using her phone. We can’t trace them. (angrily throws the wadded paper across the room.)




SCENE 20
FBI HADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC
(MULDER with TECH in the sound lab listening to LULA’s recorded voice.)

LULA: (voice) She’s not happy, but she’s alive. If I were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.

TECH: That last part, right?

MULDER: Yeah, but can you squelch the voice even more this time?

TECH: Yep. (adjusts dials) Done.

LULA: (voice) If I were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.

TECH: Yep. Yeah. There’s something there. Definitely something at the high end. Let me throw on an extra Z -14 filter and isolate everything over half a decibel.

LULA: (voice) If I were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.

(There is a motor sound audible under her voice.)

MULDER: There. That engine sound.

TECH: Let’s clean it up some more.

LULA: (voice) If I were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.

(Motor sound very audible.)

MULDER: Is that a small plane?

TECH: Taking off, by the sound of it. Give me a couple more minutes. We’ll guesstimate the altitude within a couple hundred feet.

MULDER: (under his breath) Great!

(Later, briefing room.)

AGENT BRUSKIN: (getting off phone) All right, people, settle down and grab a seat. ("here he goes again, let’s put up with him" tone) Mulder says he’s got something.

AGENT WESTIN: What? An alien virus or new information on the Kennedy assassination?

AGENT BRUSKIN: Hey, Mulder’s all right. You should pay attention. You might learn something from the man.

(MULDER enters and goes straight to the map.)

MULDER: Okay, from our last phone contact we’ve identified what sounds like light aircraft taking off. Now, Washington County Regional Airport happens to fall within our area, just south of the state line. Since takeoffs are north to south it’s a fair bet that our target area lies along this flight path. For those of you who remember ninth-grade math that gives us an area of just over three square miles to cover --- roughly 1000 households. With 100 law enforcement officials at our disposal at about 30 households per man per hour we should be able to canvass the entire area in about three hours. Agent Bruskin will grid the target area and divide it among the teams.

(Agents all begin to get up, talking.)

MULDER: And for those of you ---who don’t know already (voice unsteady) this one’s important to me. So, uh, let’s do it right. Thanks.

(Quiet for a moment, then AGENT BRUSKIN begins reading off assignments.)

AGENT BRUSKIN: Let me see Steinburg, Calder, and Westin.




SCENE 21
(Apartment, morning. WILLIS still lying in the corner, SCULLY handcuffed again to the radiator, sleeping.)

WILLIS: Scully?

SCULLY: (waking) Hmn? Huh?

WILLIS: Was there snow?

SCULLY: Yes, Jack. There was lots of snow.

WILLIS: I can’t …

SCULLY: It was December. It was the weekend after Thanksgiving.

WILLIS: I remember ---- a red stove.

SCULLY: (encouraging him) Yeah. That’s right. There was a wood-burning stove right in the middle of the room.

WILLIS: Cold.

SCULLY: Yeah.

WILLIS: So cold. I remember I had to wrap you in a blanket when the wood ran out.

SCULLY: (fondly) Yeah.

(WILLIS slumps to the side.)

SCULLY: No! Jack, don’t close your eyes. Come on, keep talking. Jack, keep talking. Come on.

DUPRE: (flashback to the bank) Get down on the floor! Get over there!

WILLIS: (sudden angry) I’m gonna execute every one of you!

SCULLY: No. No.

(Psychic!SCULLY sees DUPRE for a moment instead of WILLIS.)

DUPRE: Shut up and do it!

(SCULLY looks again, but his head is in shadow.)

(Knock at door in the other room. Holding a gun, LULA answers the door.)

LULA: Just a second. Who is it?

BIBLE SALESMAN: This is Brother T. Could I speak with you for just one moment, please?

LULA: What do you want?

BIBLE SALESMAN: Just a few minutes of your time, ma’am. Beautiful day, isn’t it? I wonder if I can interest you in the Word of the Lord --- leather bound in black or red your choice.

LULA: (closing door) Go away.

(Outside, BIBLE SALESMAN aka UNDERCOVER COP, speaks into his radio.)

BIBLE COP: This is one-four. Target sighted.

(Utility truck moves into position.)

(Inside, LULA goes into the room with WILLIS and SCULLY.)

LULA: Well, I guess it’s time to make that call.

SCULLY: He’s dead. It’s all on you now. He’s dead because of you.

LULA: (kneeling down in front of WILLIS, not sad) Well … guess it’s over. Whoever you are.

(WILLIS grabs the gun from LULA and points it at her. She falls back in surprise.)

WILLIS: Don’t move.

SCULLY: Jack!

WILLIS: Shut up!

LULA: I love you. Don’t you know? You’re why I came back.

(Outside, agents are all moving into position.)

AGENT WESTIN: (on utility truck cherry picker, into radio) This is Westin. They battened down the hatches. There’s no clear shot from this side. What about you guys?

(MULDER looks up to an agent on the roof who shakes his head.)

MULDER: (into radio) Ditto. Hold your positions. Keep radios at two.

(Agents surround the house. AGENT BRUSKIN joins MULDER.)

MULDER: How do we look?

AGENT BRUSKIN: Backup’s in but we still don’t know what’s going on in there.

MULDER: We will soon enough.

(Inside the house, LULA is desperately trying to calm WILLIS.)

LULA: I kept a bottle of medicine in the other room. I’ll go get it. What do you say, huh? (crawls over to him and begins stroking his face) I’ll get it for you. Look, look, look. I love you. I love you, baby.

WILLIS: No.

LULA: Listen, listen, listen. We still have her. We can get away with this.

WILLIS: I don’t think so, baby. Not this time.

SCULLY: Jack, put the gun down.

WILLIS: (holding LULA tight to him) You remember that --- light that I talked about? It’s beautiful. There’s nothing to be afraid of.

(He shoots LULA in the stomach as he kisses her.)

SCULLY: No!

(MULDER and other agents burst into the house.)

AGENT BRUSKIN: All right, FBI! FBI!

SCULLY: Jack!

MULDER: FB ----

(AGENT BRUSKIN checks WILLIS, MULDER goes to SCULLY, still cuffed to the radiator.)

MULDER: (concerned) Scully, are you okay?

SCULLY: (not looking at MULDER) Jack!?

(AGENT BRUSKIN shakes his head, and steps away from WILLIS’ body. MULDER and SCULLY watch the tattoo on WILLIS’ arm fade away.)




SCENE 22
(SCULLY is cleaning out WILLIS’ desk. MULDER comes up to her.)

MULDER: Hi. I got this from the morgue along with the rest of his personal effects. I thought you might want it.

(He hands her a watch with an inscription on the back.)

SCULLY: "Happy 35th, Love D." I got it for him three years ago.

MULDER: (indicating box on the desk) Next of kin?

SCULLY: Uh .. no. Jack was an only child. Both his parents died when he was in college. There’s a kid over in Parklawn. Jack’s been his Big Brother so I’m going to go and see him tomorrow. What am I going to tell him?

MULDER: (bitterly) The official story.

SCULLY: Which is?

MULDER: Fugitive Lula Phillips died yesterday in a shoot-out with federal agents which also resulted in the death of Special Agent Jack Willis – killed in the line of duty.

SCULLY: (sighs, looks away and sits) What am I supposed to tell myself?

MULDER: (starts to leave) Good night.

SCULLY: (looks at watch) It’s not working. It stopped. At 6:47.

MULDER: (turns back to her) The exact time that Jack went into cardiac arrest at the hospital.

SCULLY: What does that mean?

MULDER: It means … It means whatever you want it to mean. (gently) Good night.

(MULDER leaves.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
TASHMOO FEDERAL CORRECTION FACILITY
PENNSYLVANIA, 1989
(A wheelchair-bound man named Joe Crandell slowly rolls down a hallway past an empty bed that intrigues him. He hears screaming and rolls down in that direction. The screaming grows louder as he approaches a door. Opening it up, he slowly wheels in. He sees Doctor Ridley working over a man named John Barnett.)

JOE CRANDELL: What are you doing to Barnett?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Excuse me?

JOE CRANDELL: What are you doing to Johnny?

(Ridley puts down his knife.)

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Go on back to your ward. There's nothing you can do for your friend now.

JOE CRANDELL: What?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: John Barnett is dead.

JOE CRANDELL: No, I heard him screaming.

(Ridley picks up a knife and walks over to him, then puts the knife up under Crandell's neck.)

JOSEPH RIDLEY: I said John Barnett is dead. You understand?

(Crandell nods and goes to leave. Barnett looks at him with dead, dull eyes, his pupils completely blue.)

Go on, Crandell, get out of here. There's nothing more to see here. You understand?

(Barnett blinks. Crandell leaves. Barnett blinks again.)




SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.; PRESENT DAY
(Mulder and Scully get out of their car and start into the jewelry store.)

SCULLY: I still don't get it. What does this have to do with us?

MULDER: Robbing a jewelry store is a federal crime.

SCULLY: Thank you.

MULDER: I don't know. I got a call from some guy I used to work with over at the violent crimes section, said it was important.

(The coroner wheels away a victim as Mulder and Scully walk over to Agent Reggie Purdue. Mulder starts chanting.)

MULDER: Reggie! Reggie!

(They shake hands.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Mulder, God, I hate it when you do that.

MULDER: This is Special Agent Scully. Reggie Purdue.

(Scully and Purdue shake hands.)

REGGIE PURDUE: How are you?

SCULLY: What happened here?

REGGIE PURDUE: Lone gunman took out a salesgirl after she filled up a bag for him.

MULDER: You guys turn up anything?

REGGIE PURDUE: Not much... except... this. It's going to blow your mind.

MULDER: Why?

REGGIE PURDUE: I'm telling you, Mulder, this is going to blow... your... mind.

(He hands Mulder an evidence bag with a piece of paper in it. Mulder reads the paper.)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: Wait, wait a second...

REGGIE PURDUE: You see why I called you?

MULDER: What about witness descriptions?

REGGIE PURDUE: White male, five-eleven to six feet, ski mask.

(Mulder stares at him.)

MULDER: Damn it, Reggie, that's Barnett.

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, but it can't be.

SCULLY: Who's Barnett?

(They stare at her. Mulder and Scully walk out.)

MULDER: It was my first case at the bureau. Barnett was doing armed jobs all over D.C. and getting away with it, very trigger-happy. Killed seven people. There was this big task force, Reggie was my ASAC. I was twenty-eight years old, right out of the academy. I had this theory on the case. Reggie thought I was full of it. I was full of it.

SCULLY: What was the theory?

MULDER: That Barnett had an inside connection. An employee at the armored car company was tipping him off about large shipments of cash. Turns out I was sort of right.

SCULLY: Sort of?

MULDER: Yeah, we planted bogus waybills, manifests with the armored car company to try to set a trap but Barnett was way ahead of us. That's... when the notes started.

(They stop walking. He hands Scully the bag with the note in it.)

SCULLY: "Fox can't guard the chicken coop."

MULDER: Clever, huh?

SCULLY: So you never caught him?

MULDER: No, we did. We did, but not, uh, not clean. An agent died because I screwed up.

(She stares at him for a second.)

SCULLY: And what happened to Barnett?

MULDER: He avoided the death penalty on a technicality. But he went down for every job he did. Consecutive terms, three-hundred-and-forty years. The judge promised me he would die in prison.

SCULLY: So you think he escaped?

MULDER: No, that's just it. He did die in prison, four years ago.

SCULLY: You're sure?

MULDER: I was paying attention.

(He walks away.)




SCENE 3
CRIME LABS
(Agent Henderson is looking at the note under an electron-emission note. Mulder is looking as well through a second pair of lenses on the same machine.)

HENDERSON: This guy a friend of yours?

MULDER: Yeah, I play golf with him every Sunday. What do you think?

HENDERSON: You just brought this in ten minutes ago.

MULDER: You're slipping, Henderson.

HENDERSON: Ten minutes may be enough time for you, Mulder. Of course, I wouldn't know that from personal experience.

(Mulder looks at her, sitting down.)

MULDER: Yeah... seriously, what do you think?

HENDERSON: Okay, first impressions... the ink is fresh, the note was written in the last forty-eight hours. Ballpoint, but you knew that. A right-hander. Let's see... written by someone sitting down, but now I'm just showing off.

MULDER: Yeah, does it match Barnett?

HENDERSON: I'd say it's him.

MULDER: But you're not sure?

(Henderson looks at him.)

HENDERSON: Ninety-five percent. The writing's sloppy. Some of the ascenders and descenders are heavier.

MULDER: Could it have been traced over an old note of Barnett's?

HENDERSON: Could be, but it's a damn good job if it is.

MULDER: Thanks, Henderson, I owe you one.

HENDERSON: Promises, promises.

(Mulder leaves.)




SCENE 4
REGGIE PURDUE'S OFFICE
(Scully and Purdue are watching a video of the stake-out where they caught Barnett. Agents surround the track as Barnett steps out, holding a gun to his partner's head.)

REGGIE PURDUE: There's Barnett. We staked-out an airport warehouse but everything went to hell when Barnett took the driver of the armored truck hostage.

(Mulder sneaks up behind Barnett.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

REGGIE PURDUE: There, coming around back. Barnett doesn't see him.

SCULLY: He's got a clear shot.

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, he should've taken it.

SCULLY: But he couldn't.

REGGIE PURDUE: No, no, not with a hostage so close.

SCULLY: Because it's not by the book.

REGGIE PURDUE: It would have saved one life, maybe two. Bastard Barnett just started blasting away.

(Reggie stands. In the video, Barnett shoots his hostage then another agent before Mulder tags him twice.)

SCULLY: So, Mulder did shoot Barnett.

REGGIE PURDUE: Twice, in the shoulder and hand but not before Barnett killed the driver and Agent Steve Wallenberg. Mulder never forgave himself for that. You should have heard his testimony at Barnett's trial.

SCULLY: Probably had a lot to do with the sentence the judge gave Barnett.

REGGIE PURDUE: I'll never forget Mulder coming down from the witness stand and Barnett turning and saying he'd get Mulder. To tell you the truth, I wish Mulder had killed Barnett right there in the warehouse.

(He walks away. On the video is a still shot of the agents hovering over Barnett.)




SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder takes a print-out out of the printer as Scully walks over.)

SCULLY: What did Henderson come up with?

MULDER: Ninety-five percent sure it's Barnett's handwriting.

(Scully looks at the paper.)

SCULLY: What's that?

MULDER: Federal Bureau of Prisons sent me a copy of his death certificate. "Name of deceased, Barnett, John Irvin. Cause of death, cardiac arrest. Date, September sixteenth, 1989."

(They start off.)

SCULLY: Then it must be a very clever copycat.

MULDER: The note was written in the last forty-eight hours.

SCULLY: Pull any prints?

MULDER: No prints.

SCULLY: Barnett had a lot of time on his hands while he was in prison, maybe he planned it with someone on the outside.

(Mulder opens the door to an office.)

MULDER: Revenge from the grave? That'd be a neat trick.

SCULLY: He planned to get you, didn't he?

(Mulder stares at her.)

I was just down talking to Agent Purdue.

MULDER: And he showed you the videotape?

(She nods.)

SCULLY: You did the right thing, Mulder.

MULDER: Did I? Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids. One of his boys is an all-star on his football team now. If I had pulled the trigger two seconds earlier and Wallenberg would be here to see his kid play. Instead, I got some dead man robbing jewelry stores and sending me haikus.

(He walks into the office.)




SCENE 6
FOOTBALL FIELD
(A young football team is playing in the mud. The coach is out on the field watching. The kids shout to one another. Parents watch on the bleachers. Mulder also sits there.)

COACH: Fire it in there!

(The quarterback throws a pass to his reciever.)

Yeah, that's better!

WOMAN: Very good! Way to go, Alex!

COACH: Hustle it up! Come on, guys, line it up. Let's go.

QUARTERBACK: Down! Set! Hut!

(The boys run another play.)

COACH: Go, go, go! You're the man, there it is!

(The quarterback fires another shot to the receiver.)

WOMAN: Very good!

COACH: That was over the line, let's go! Okay, watch the ball.

(Mulder starts off. He passes a strange man, heavily dressed. He walks over to his car as the screams fade. A package is on his car seat. He opens the door and takes it. Opening it up, he sees surveillance photos and a note that reads "A hunted Fox eventually dies." Mulder shuffles through the surveillance photos and looks around for Barnett.)

MULDER: I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

(The parents and kids on the bleachers look back at him. Mulder gets in his car and drives off. The strange man looks back at him, eyes glazed over, pupils completely blue and dead.)




SCENE 7
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Purdue, sitting at his desk, looks through the various pictures that were in the envelope.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Agent Mulder, and I think that somebody is messing with your head.

MULDER: Barnett said he'd get me, you were there.

REGGIE PURDUE: I don't care what Barnett said, he's dead, Mulder.

MULDER: Apparently not.

REGGIE PURDUE: Aw, come on. Let me tell you something, there are a lot of guys who know that Barnett made the threat.

MULDER: It's Barnett, Reggie.

REGGIE PURDUE: How could you say that?

MULDER: I don't know, I just feel it.

(Purdue stands and signals to a man, who walks out. Purdue closes the door.)

REGGIE PURDUE: You know, all this talk about you, about "Spooky" Mulder, I never used to pay it much mind. I figured it was just talk about how paranoid you were and all.

MULDER: And now?

REGGIE PURDUE: Remember the day you walked into my office wet from Quantico? You pissed me off just looking at you but then I saw how your mind worked. How you were always three jumps ahead. It was scary, Mulder. Everybody said so.

MULDER: I've heard this story.

(Mulder turns, but Reggie grabs his arm and turns him back around.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, well, maybe you ought to hear it again. You let a lot of people down here in the bureau. They had big plans for you. A lot of people are saying that "Spooky" Mulder has become an embarrassment, a liability.

MULDER: What? Are you saying that somebody from the bureau's behind this?

REGGIE PURDUE: Maybe, maybe not. It's always best to cover your ass in any event.

(Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: Sorry. This was just faxed.

(She hands Purdue a paper.)

This is a copy of John Barnett's last will and testament. No surviving relatives, left what little he had to another prisoner... a Joe Crandall... and instructions for his body to be cremated. His will was executed six months after his death and this document states that his ashes were spread along the bank of the Delaware River by an employee of the crematory used by the prison.

REGGIE PURDUE: It's like I said, I think somebody's messing with your head.

MULDER: Killing a sales clerk just to leave me a note? I'd say that's going a little out of your way.

(He picks up the pictures and leaves.)




SCENE 8
COMPUTER LAB
(Mulder is sitting next to the computer technician. On the screen is a picture of Barnett with the words "Subject: Barnett, John.")

MULDER: He's older now, he may have put on some weight.

COMPUTER TECHNICIAN: How much older?

MULDER: Five years.

(She presses some keys and on the screen, Barnett's face grows older and thinner.)

He could be wearing any kind of disguise.

(She presses some more keys and Barnett grows a beard. Mulder stands and thinks back to his day in court. He sits on the stand as the prosecutor walks around.)

PROSECUTOR: Take us back to the day in question. Was it your impression, Agent Mulder, that John Barnett took a kind of a perverse pleasure in his crimes? Didn't he send you notes to taunt you?

(She glares at Barnett as she passes him by.)

MULDER: Yes, I felt that he was, uh, daring us to catch him. That he killed his victims almost as if it were part of a game.

PROSECUTOR: Describe for the court if you would, Agent Mulder, what happened when you finally caught John Barnett.

MULDER: We had a customs warehouse at the airport staked out. Now, we knew that Barnett had someone working for the armored car transport tipping him off about large cash shipments but we never figured that he would actually be inside the vehicle when it arrived. That's how Barnett was able to take the driver of the vehicle hostage.

PROSECUTOR: In other words, John Barnett used his own accomplice as a hostage?

MULDER: Yes, ma'am.

(He nods slightly. The judge is taking down notes.)

PROSECUTOR: And then what happened?

MULDER: We surrounded Barnett. We ordered him to surrender his hostage and his weapon.

PROSECUTOR: And where were you at this time, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I was right behind Barnett.

PROSECUTOR: With a clear shot at the suspect?

(Mulder hesitates, then nods and speaks softly.)

MULDER: Yes, ma'am.

PROSECUTOR: But you didn't fire. Why?

MULDER: Well, it's against F.B.I. regulations to unnecessarily endanger the life of a hostage.

(Purdue, in the front row, looks at Barnett at his seat at the defense table. Barnett, wearing handcuffs, seems to take great pleasure in Mulder's testimony.)

And I thought that with no means of escape, Barnett would give up.

PROSECUTOR: But what happened instead?

MULDER: The suspect, uh, John Barnett, fired his weapon point-blank at the hostage and then he turned his gun on Steve Wallenberg... shot him in the face.

(Mulder's resolve starts to break.)

PROSECUTOR: Thank you, Agent Mulder. No further questions at this time.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: He gunned him down just for spite.

DEFENSE LAWYER: Your honor, we object...

JUDGE: Witness will step down.

MULDER: This is a man with a wife and two small children...

(The judge bangs her gavel.)

JUDGE: Please step down...

MULDER: ...and you, you shot him without hesitation, without conscience, without an ounce of humanity.

(The judge continues to bang the gavel.)

DEFENSE LAWYER: Your honor, do something.

MULDER: Which is why you should die like an animal, you son of a bitch!

JUDGE: Agent Mulder, if you do not stop, I will find you in contempt of court.

(Barnett takes a sip of his water and smiles at Mulder. The crowd continues to murmur.)

Order, order in the court.

(Mulder steps down. The crowd continues to murmur and the judge continues to bang the gavel.)

If there is not order in this court, I will be forced to clear the courtroom.

DEFENSE LAWYER: Your honor, the defense finds they are highly irregular and inflammatory against the defendant now and we ask that they be stricken from the record.

(Mulder stops and glares at Barnett before sitting down.)

JUDGE: Duly noted, counsel. The jury will disregard the witness' last...

(Barnett looks at Mulder as he sits down next to Purdue. He whispers the words.)

JOHN BARNETT: I'll... get... you.

(He winks and blows a kiss, then turns around. Purdue mouths some words to Mulder as Barnett turns around. The present. Mulder leans over to the computer specialist.)

MULDER: I'll need printouts of every variation.

COMPUTER SPECIALIST: Right.

(Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: I just got off the phone with the prison.

MULDER: What did they come up with?

SCULLY: No, I called them on a hunch. John Barnett died of a heart attack, right? At least that's what it says on his death certificate. Well, I had them fax me all of his medical records. Barnett was admitted to the prison infirmary for an infection in his right hand. There isn't any indication or diagnosis of coronary complications. In fact, on his physical six months earlier, he was given a clean bill of health.




SCENE 9
TASHMOO FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
(An inmate standing next to Crandall points at Mulder and Scully in the doorway.)

INMATE: Crandall. Someone to see you.

(Mulder and Scully walk on either side of Crandall, still in his wheelchair.)

JOE CRANDALL: I don't get many visitors.

MULDER: You knew John Barnett?

JOE CRANDALL: Yes, sir.

MULDER: How well did you know him?

(A guard walks by Scully, squeezing past her.)

GUARD: Excuse me, ma'am.

JOE CRANDALL: Pretty well.

SCULLY: He left you everything he had in his will. You must've known him better than pretty well.

JOE CRANDALL: Used to change his bandages, and we just got to... know each other.

MULDER: Are you aware that Barnett died of cardiac arrest in this facility in 1989?

JOE CRANDALL: Cardiac arrest? Where does it say that?

SCULLY: On his death certificate.

(They stop.)

JOE CRANDALL: He ain't dead, is he?

MULDER: Why do you say that?

JOE CRANDALL: Last time I saw John Barnett, it was right in that room over there.

(He nods towards a door.)

Doctor working on him with a knife took his bad hand clean off.

SCULLY: What doctor?

MULDER: Was it Doctor Ridley?

JOE CRANDALL: Yeah, yeah, it was Doctor Ridley, that's the one. He told me Johnny was dead but, uh, I knew it was a lie. Put a knife right up under my chin just for asking.

SCULLY: How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead?

(Crandall takes a deep breath.)

JOE CRANDALL: I saw him looking at me. I saw him blink. Man, I'll never forget those eyes.




SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Jail photos are posted on the light screen as Mulder feeds the clip into his gun.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: I know what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to hang around and wait for Barnett to send me another valentine.

SCULLY: You mean the ghost of John Barnett.

MULDER: I didn't know you believe in ghosts, Scully.

(The phone rings. Scully walks over and picks it up.)

SCULLY: Hello? Yeah, just a minute.

(She looks back at Mulder.)

It's for you.

(He walks over and takes the phone.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Barnett, who is completely shrouded in shadow except for portions of his face.)

JOHN BARNETT: Fox Mulder.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Barnett?

(He signals to Scully.)

SCULLY: All right, all right...

(She runs off to trace the call.)

JOHN BARNETT: You sound surprised.

(He goes over to his tape recorder and presses record.)

MULDER: Well, you know, shouldn't I be?

JOHN BARNETT: You know, it's illegal to tape another's phone call...

(Cut back to Barnett.)

...without their express permission. Isn't that what they call it?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: In some states. What makes you think I'm taping you?

JOHN BARNETT: Same thing makes me think you're putting a trace on this call.

MULDER: What state are you in?

(Cut back to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: The same state you are. I stood next to you in line for coffee this morning.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: I don't think so.

(Cut back to Barnett, who laughs.)

JOHN BARNETT: Man, I'm everywhere you are. Everywhere. I own you.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: How do I know it's really you, Barnett?

(Cut to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: What did I say to you in the courtroom? Did you ever... doubt me?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I don't know, what did you tell me in the courtroom?

(Cut back to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: Huh... if you think you're going to keep me on this phone with this clumsy act...

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Listen, by all accounts, John Barnett is a dead man.

(Cut to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: Oh, you're the dead man... Mulder.

(Cut to Mulder, who tenses up a little.)

MULDER: Fine. I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are.

(Cut back to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: You want confirmation? You got it.

(He blows a kiss and hangs up. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Barnett? You there?

(He slams the phone down. Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: You lost him.

MULDER: Yeah, he was hip to the trace.

SCULLY: Was it Barnett?

MULDER: John Barnett was from New Hampshire. He had a slight accent. Listen to this.

(He stops the recorder and rewinds it, then presses stop and play.)

MULDER ON RECORDER: I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are.

JOHN BARNETT ON RECORDER: You want confirmation? You got it.

(Mulder stops the recording and snaps his fingers.)

SCULLY: What did he mean by that?

MULDER: I don't know, but that is... John Barnett. I'm sure of it.




SCENE 11
AGENT REGGIE PURDUE'S HOUSE
(Purdue lays asleep in his bed, having fallen asleep reading. His crime book is still in his hand and his glasses are half on his face. The phone rings and he wakes up.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Oh...

(His glasses fall to the floor as he picks up the phone.)

Yeah.

MULDER: Reggie, it's Mulder.

REGGIE PURDUE: Mulder, what do you want? It's the middle of the night.

(Cut to Mulder, who looks at his watch and smiles.)

MULDER: IT'S ONLY 10:45, old man.

(Cut back to Purdue.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, well... I was sleeping.

MULDER: Listen, Reggie, it doesn't look like Barnett's dead after all.

REGGIE PURDUE: Now what?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I got an inmate at the prison who swears he saw Barnett alive the night they say he died.

(Cut to Purdue as he sits up.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Mulder, go home. Get some rest.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: No, listen, Reggie, there's just one thing that doesn't make sense to me.

(Cut to Purdue. A shadow creeps down his hallway in the back.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, what's that?

MULDER: That Agent Henderson said that that note that was left at the jewelry store was written by a right-hander.

(The person steps into the bedroom silently.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, so?

MULDER: Well, this inmate at the prison swears he saw Barnett's right hand amputated.

(The person, Barnett, steps on Purdue's glasses and wraps his deformed right hand around Purdue's throat, choking him. Purdue gags in pain, dropping his phone as he is lifted off the bed. Cut to Mulder.)

Reggie, you there? Hey, Reggie!

(Cut back to Barnett and Purdue. Purdue is thrown down onto the bed, dead.)

Reggie! Reggie, what's going on? Are you there? What the hell is going on, Reggie?

(Barnett tosses a note down onto Purdue's body. Cut to Mulder.)

Reggie! What happened? Hey, Reggie!

(Cut back to Purdue. Barnett slinks back into the shadows. The phone is still off the hook.)

What's going on? Are you there? What the hell's going on, Reggie?

(Later, Scully walks into to a melee of policemen, agents and crime photographers.)

SCULLY: I hope you guys brought your fine-toothed comb. I want every piece of lint collected and analyzed. If nothing turns up, run it through it again.

(She walks over to Mulder, who is staring at the desk.)

Mulder...

MULDER: His wife died of cancer six years ago. Never liked to talk about it.

(He walks around her.)

As long as I knew him, he was working on a mystery novel. He promised to show it to me once, but he never did. I think he was afraid I wouldn't like it. I'm probably the only guy on the bureau he trusted enough to even ask.

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

MULDER: I'm just thinking how different things would've been if I would've taken that shot at Barnett when I had it.

SCULLY: Mulder... we're still not a hundred percent sure that this is him.

(A siren is heard outside. Mulder points to a note on the desk wrapped in an evidence bag. She picks it up and reads it. The note reads:

"Funerals for Fox's friends
-- then for Fox"

She looks back at him. He seems stoic.)




SCENE 12
CRIME LABS
(Henderson is looking at the new note under the electron-emission microscope.)

HENDERSON: Fresh ink, slightly smeared... I hate to tell you, and I'm not known to be wrong about these things, but this note was most certainly written by a right-handed person.

(She pulls away from the microscope and he looks through.)

You see the pressure points inside the pen grooves? It's a dead giveaway.

MULDER: Would you be able to tell if this note was written by somebody using a prosthetic hand?

(She looks back through.)

HENDERSON: Well, this fellow... and I'm assuming from the cursive figures here that it is a male suspect... he has a fairly nice, fluid style. Judging from the pressure variations in the connectors, this person would need good finger dexterity. You're not going to get that with a prosthesis.

MULDER: So you think it's the same person that wrote the first note.

HENDERSON: Uh-huh.

(Mulder takes the note.)

This the guy you think killed Agent Purdue?

MULDER: Yeah.

(He walks around her.)

HENDERSON: You know what occured to me? You never got any prints off those notes.

(He reaches behind her and takes the other note.)

If this guy was wearing a glove on his pen hand, the note wouldn't be smeared like it is. For what it's worth.




SCENE 13
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Scully is on the phone when Mulder walks in. The phone is still ringing on the other end, though. She hangs up.)

SCULLY: I was just trying to find you. Listen to this. According to the A.M.A., Doctor Ridley, who signed Barnett's death certificate, hasn't officially been a doctor since 1979.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: His membership expired and wasn't renowed after the state of Maryland revoked his medical license for flagrant research malpractice and misuse of a government grant.

(He reaches for the papers she is holding.)

MULDER: Where does it say that?

SCULLY: Right here. In the federal journal for the National Institute of Health.

(She hands him the paper. They start towards the door.)

MULDER: What kind of research?

SCULLY: He was conducting experiments on young children afflicted with a disease called progeria.

(They walk out.)




SCENE 14
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH; BETHESDA, MA
(On the viewscreen is a movie of a young girl who looks very decrepit and old walking around.)

NIH DOCTOR: The patient you see is an eight-year-old girl suffering from the advanced stages of progeria.

(He walks in front of the screen and around to the agents. On the screen, the girl starts talking to a doctor.)

MULDER: She looks about ninety.

NIH DOCTOR: Only about a hundred cases have ever been reported so the disease is rare.

SCULLY: But fatal.

NIH DOCTOR: Some progeria patients make it to early adulthood but others become terminal at age seven or eight.

MULDER: What's the cause of death?

NIH DOCTOR: Clinically, it's cardiac or cerebral vascular disease but actually, these poor kids die of old age.

(The movie flips to that of Doctor Ridley with the young girl.)

MULDER: Is that Doctor Ridley?

NIH DOCTOR: Yes, in 1974. Joe Ridley thought that he could take their accelerated aging and slow it down. Initially, some of his lab work was promising but then... things got out of control. He wanted to begin human trials.

MULDER: Why wasn't he allowed to?

NIH DOCTOR: Because he hadn't met the criteria. It was all too hypothetical, too... dangerous. I mean... I knew Joe Ridley. He didn't care about those kids. He talked about them as if they were laboratory animals. This terrible disease, progeria... he saw it as "a wonderful opportunity." He used those exact words with me once. An opportunity to "unlock all the secrets." When they refused to allow the human trials, he became enraged. Do you know what they called Joe Ridley behind his back?

(On the viewscreen, Ridley is talking to the camera but there is no audio.)

MULDER: What?

NIH DOCTOR: Doktor Mengele.

SCULLY: So, how did Doctor Ridley eventually lose his medical license?

NIH DOCTOR: He went ahead with the human trials secretly on an out-patient basis.

(Mulder walks over to the viewscreen.)

When we learned about it, of course, we terminated his grant and filed charges with the state medical boards.

SCULLY: I'm afraid your colleague, Doctor Ridley, has dropped off the face of the earth.

NIH DOCTOR: Yeah. Although, it's rumored he went to South America to continue his work.

(Mulder and Scully leave and start down the hallway.)

SCULLY: You just don't reverse aging.

MULDER: Ridley's found a way.

SCULLY: Listen to what you're saying.

MULDER: He wanted human research subjects, right? Prisoners. Prisoners like John Barnett.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's science fiction.

MULDER: Well, what would you have said twenty years ago about gene splicing, DNA fingerprinting, cloning, artificial intelligence?

(He pushes the down button for the elevator.)

Maybe we're not looking for a man in his late forty's after all. Maybe John Barnett has found the perfect disguise... youth.

(The elevator door opens and they go inside. Scully pushes a button and the elevator door closes.)




SCENE 15
COMPUTER LAB
(On the computer screen is the original picture of John Barnett. The writing in the upper left hand says "Subject: Barnett, John.")

MULDER: I want to age him backwards now. Let's start with ten years.

(The technician types in some keys and the face becomes healthier, the hair thicker.)

Now, five years more.

(More keys are pressed and the face becomes even younger.)

And add twenty pounds. A healthy twenty pounds.

(Mulder looks at the final result.)




SCENE 16
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Scully is typing on her laptop. We hear her voice over it.)

SCULLY: Ridley's notes from the human trials at N.I.H. indicate he didn't see aging as inevitable but as an opportunistic disease. A disease that could be prevented, reversed even, by changing the chemical cues that trigger certain genes. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ridley's work yielded any results or that his theories, all hope to the contrary, hold any validity.

(John Barnett's lizard-like hand turns the doorknob to Scully's apartment. Scully hears the door creak, tries to hear any more discernible noises, and goes back to typing.)

According to the leading scientific journals, projections on this kind of genetic engineering are at best speculative and futuristic.

(Scully, worried about the noise, takes off her glasses and stands. She takes her gun off the mantle, takes it out of the holster and loads it. Walking warily, gun pointed out, she begins to check her apartment. In the shadows, Barnett watches her. There is a knock on the door and Scully slowly makes her way to the door. More knocking.)

SCULLY: Who is it?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Doctor Joe Ridley.

(Scully, perplexed, unchaines her door and opens it up, pointing her gun at him. He instinctively raises his hands. Barnett, faced with this new challenge, skulks away into the shadows and out. Mulder, Scully, and Ridley are all sitting down in different chairs. Scully is taking notes. Ridley's eyes have the same dead glaze over them that Barnett does.)

MULDER: If you're really Doctor Joseph Ridley, where've you been for the past five years?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: I originally continued my research in Mexico but for the last three years, I spent my time in Central America. In Belize, to be exact.

MULDER: What about Barnett?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: John Barnett is the only patient left. The only one who survived the experiments.

MULDER: What about you?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: My appearance is decieving. I have no more than a month to live as I am dying from a rare cerebral vascular disease.

SCULLY: The same disease that kills the kids suffering from progeria?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: That's right.

(He laughs a little.)

An unfortunate side effect of the treatment. By using the genetic components of progeria, I was able to reverse the aging process in much the same way the disease expedited it. At the same time, I and my patients became genetically susceptible to the same ailments a child six or eight would if he had the disease.

MULDER: And what about Barnett?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: John Barnett. If I didn't so personally detest the man, I might call him my one triumph.

MULDER: Barnett's not dying.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Only his eyes, which for some reason do not respond to the gene therapy. Otherwise, John Barnett appears to be thriving.

SCULLY: But how?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: I varied Barnett's treatment. Once I isolated the progeria receptors, I stumbled onto something quite unexpected... these same genes related to the production of myelin.

SCULLY: The material that insulates neurons in the body.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Yes. You see, myelin is not present in the very young and by reversing the effects of aging, I found, with Barnett, I was able to regulate the production of myelin. Myelin being the material that prohibits you or I from, say, regenerating a new hand if we were to have ours cut off.

MULDER: You were able to grow John Barnett a new hand?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Not exactly. Not a human hand, anyway. I could never get the cells to divide or behave properly.

SCULLY: I, I'm afraid to ask. What kind of hand did you grow?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: There had been some successful work done in London. By taking samples of what we call cell morphegins from an amputated salamander arm and applying them to the back of the creature, they were able to grow a new limb on a completely different part of the body. But only on salamanders.

MULDER: Until John Barnett.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Yeah.

SCULLY: Unbelievable.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: My work has cost me dearly. I'm an outcast in the medical community. I was called Doctor Mengele, Doctor Frankenstein but I didn't care.

SCULLY: Because you knew that if your theories panned out...

JOSEPH RIDLEY: The man who owns the fountain of youth controls the world. When the A.M.A. censured me, certain sponsors came out of the woodwork. One of them is the U.S. government.

MULDER: They financed your research?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: You might be more surprised to learn just how high up the ladder this dirty little secret goes.




SCENE 17
GERTIE'S BAR
(Deep Throat walks in and over to a table in the back, sitting down next to Mulder. He talks relatively quietly compared to the rest of the noise in the bar.)

DEEP THROAT: I know why you've contacted me. Listen and I'll explain. I am not particularly proud of the way in which this matter was handled but, uh, like it or not, John Barnett is a fact of life.

MULDER: I wish Agent Perdue were around to appreciate the irony.

DEEP THROAT: The government knew full well that Barnett was in the country. You, of course, know that Barnett stole all of Ridley's research.

MULDER: Yes, Ridley was...

DEEP THROAT: Well, what Ridley doesn't know is that our government is bargaining with Barnett to buy it from him.

(Mulder looks away and laughs, disgusted.)

MULDER: What does he want?

DEEP THROAT: A lot of money, immunity, safe haven.

MULDER: Will he get it?

(Deep Throat laughs.)

DEEP THROAT: He holds all the cards.

MULDER: You're aware that this... freak of science you're negotiating with is a murderer?

(Deep Throat nods.)

DEEP THROAT: The information he has... could change the course of mankind. Consider the options.

MULDER: I will.

(He gets up and leaves. Deep Throat sighs and takes a sip of his drink.)




SCENE 18
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(It is 7:20 in the morning. The sun is rising. The phone rings. Once nobody picks up, the machine clicks.)

SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi. This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message after the tone.

(It beeps, then two more digits are dialed. Scully steps out of the shower.)

ANSWERING MACHINE: Reading messages.

(Scully looks down at the machine.)

MARGARET SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi, Dana, it's Mom. I just wanted to call and say hi. Um, give me a call, whenever. Okay, bye.

(Another beep and the next message plays. Scully looks shocked.)

KATHY ON MACHINE: Hi, Dana, it's Kathy. Look, I hope you're still going to meet me before my cello recital...




SCENE 19
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is looking at an artist's rendition of the younger Barnett. Scully puts her answering machine down on the desk.)

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: It's my private answering machine. Or at least it used to be.

(He puts down the paper as she on the desk.)

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: When I ran from the shower this morning, I heard someone dialing in my private code and replaying my messages. Last night, before Doctor Ridley, I could have sworn that someone was in my apartment. But when Ridley knocked, I thought I'd mistaken the noise for him.

MULDER: Scully...

(She holds up the answering machine.)

SCULLY: This morning, I took this down to prints before I came here. John Barnett's left index oblique is on the underside of this unit.

(The phone rings and Scully puts the machine down as Mulder picks up.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Barnett, who moans. His face is in shadows except for his left eye, which is glazed over blue. Cut back to Mulder, who stands.)

Barnett?

(Barnett groans.)

JOHN BARNETT: Your new friend, Ridley?

(Cut back to Barnett.)

Don't grow to fond of him... huh? He's going to die soon like the rest of your friends.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: The rest of my friends?

(Cut to Barnett, who is smiling.)

JOHN BARNETT: One by one.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: You're not that smart.

(Cut back to Barnett. He chuckles and rubs his chin with a finger from his grotesque hand.)

JOHN BARNETT: Tell me, you're not going to make me prove it to you again, are you? Oh, well, no matter. It'll be your turn soon enough.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, you won't get that chance.

(Cut to Barnett, who finds this hilarious.)

JOHN BARNETT: Oh, no?

(He laughs.)

Who's going to stop me, huh? Man, this is... this is the land of the free!

(His laughing dies down.)

Well, I'm just checking in. Bye. For now.

(Rubbing his chin, he hangs up. Cut to Mulder, who hangs up as well.)

MULDER: What does Barnett know about your phone messages?

SCULLY: Uh, that my mother called for no reason and I'm meeting a friend before her cello recital.

MULDER: Where's that?




SCENE 20
JANIE TAYLOR MEMORIAL RECITAL HALL; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is briefing his fellow agents. Scully hands out various pictures of the artist's renditions of Barnett.)

MULDER: Before the performance and during, we're working at a disadvantage because we don't know exactly what Barnett looks like. Study each of these faces. Know them, particularly the eyes.

SCULLY: I'm including a diagram of the theater. You have six front entrances and four more backstage.

(She finishes handing out fliers and stands next to Mulder.)

MULDER: We know that if he shows, he'll be keying on Scully. So wherever she is, she should not leave your sight. We've got two hours before the performance. Know this place inside and out. We don't want any shots fired if we can help it. We want to take Barnett alive, okay?

(The men walk off. Mulder and Scully start off as well.)

How are you feeling?

SCULLY: It's the first time I've ever played the target.

MULDER: Let's make sure it's not the last time.

(An agent walks out onto the stage as instruments are being tuned up. On the stage is Scully's friend Kathy with her cello. A man is tuning a piano. The agent walks down the center stairs and out. The man at the piano watches him go, using his grotesque hand to play with the sounds, his eyes glazed over in blue. Mulder walks into the main room, which is loud with people talking. He makes his way through the crowd and looks around at the incoming people. Scully looks at him. Barnett, wearing gloves, takes his revolver out of a case and stuffs it under his blue sweater in his pants. He walks offstage and down the aisleway calmly as the cello plays behind him. Walking into the main room, he makes his way through the crowd, looking around. He sees Scully and shoves through two people, whipping out his revolver.)

SCULLY: Gun!

(She pushes a man out of the way and is winged. The next shot is dead on in the chest and Scully falls like a ragdoll. Mulder runs over, gun drawn. He pushes a man out of the way.)

MULDER: Down!

(Barnett sneers, lowering his gun as people scream. He runs into the main room as Mulder runs over to Scully, looking down at her.)

Check her out!

(A man checks on Scully. Barnett runs down the aisle and on stage, grabbing Kathy by the neck and standing behind her, holding the gun to her head. Mulder runs in followed by two other agents. She struggles against his grip.)

JOHN BARNETT: Stay back, Mulder!

(She moans and gasps loudly.)

Shut up...

(Mulder turns back to the other agents.)

MULDER: Back off, back off...

(Mulder aims his gun.)

JOHN BARNETT: I'll kill her! Don't even think about it!

MULDER: Just let her go.

JOHN BARNETT: Go ahead and shoot. Go ahead, man. Shoot, Mulder! What are you afraid of, huh? What, it's against regulations... huh? No, man. You need me alive, don't you? Because I'm the only one who knows where the research is! Huh? So I could shoot her! And you just to live with it, don't you, huh?

MULDER: Shut up!

KATHY: Please, no. Please, please, please...

(Mulder lowers his gun.)

JOHN BARNETT: How about it, Mulder?

(Mulder raises it back up with steel resolve.)

KATHY: Please, please, please, please, please...

JOHN BARNETT: Just like old times, huh? Huh?

(Mulder pulls the trigger. Barnett's eyes glaze over differently as his whole body tenses up. Kathy gasps and he slowly falls. She screams and starts crying. Mulder stares at the stage for a second, then looks back at the other two agents.)

MULDER: Call an ambulance!

AGENT: Okay... it's okay, Scully, an ambulance is on the way.

(Scully eyes burst open. She moves slowly, her eyes focusing.)

You all right? Don't try to move...

(She moans and looks down at her chest, pulling open the shirt to reveal damaged kevlar. She lets her head fall back and sighs in relief. Sirens pull into earshot.)




SCENE 21
HOSPITAL
(Mulder looks in through the window as doctors and nurses work on Barnett. A man-in-black is interrogating Barnett as well.)

MAN-IN-BLACK: Where are they? Can you here me?

DOCTOR: One, two, three...

MAN-IN-BLACK: Where'd you hide them?

(Mulder looks back at Scully, who approaches him. The noise in the operating room becomes a low din.)

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Like somebody kicked me in the ribs.

MULDER: That bullet went through eight layers of kevlar, you're lucky to be alive.

SCULLY: What about him?

MULDER: Well, they flew in three specialists to try to save his life. That guy in the ugly suit there is probably C.I.A. Been trying to talk to him.

SCULLY: Is Barnett conscious?

MULDER: Yeah, but he's not talking.

(They stare at the melee in the emergency room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I know what you did wasn't by the book.

MULDER: Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it?

(They stare at each other. Barnett tenses up as nurses hold his hands down.)

DOCTOR: Barnett! Barnett, come on!

(Barnett's salamander hand falls limp as he flatlines.)

MAN: Vitals dropping...

DOCTOR: Barnett... shock him, now!

(Barnett stares at Mulder through the glass, dead.)

SCULLY: They lost him.

MULDER: Bastard will take that research with him to the grave.

SCULLY: Where do you think it is?

(Cut to a busy airport. Mulder talks to Scully over the scene.)

MULDER: Who knows? If Barnett didn't destroy it, he could have stashed it anywhere. Which would have a cruel irony, wouldn't it? Scientific knowledge that could change the course of mankind buried out in a field somewhere or in some safe deposit box. Getting old, just like the rest of us.

SCULLY: If it didn't destroy it, chances are that somehow, someday, somebody will find it.

MULDER: And when they do... maybe he can get his revenge from beyond the grave but somehow, I feel like we haven't heard the last from John Barnett.

(Many people pass the airport locker numbered 935, never suspecting what lies inside.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
THE SKIES OF IRAG; 37TH PARALLEL; PRESENT DAY
(An Iraqi fighter pilot is flying when he spots a UFO. He looks down at his radar and sees that the UFO does not show up.)

IRAQI PILOT: (Translated from Arabic) Base, this is patrol six. Request I.D. on object 25 miles from my position bearing three-four-one.

IRAQI BASE

(The UFO does not show up on Ground Control’s radar either.)

IRAQI OFFICER: (Translated from Arabic) Negative on object. Are your bearings correct?

FIGHTER PLANE

(The pilot hears a loud hum and looks around for the plane.)

IRAQI PILOT: (Translated from Arabic) It was there a second ago.

(There is a bright flash, he screams.)

IRAQI BASE

(The radar now shows the plane and various other blips on the screen.)

IRAQI OFFICER: (Translated from Arabic) You’re under attack! You’re under attack!

FIGHTER PLANE

(The pilot attaches his helmet. We can hear the officer screaming various Arabic words over the intercom. There is another bright flash, and the pilot grunts. The UFO whizzes by as the pilot locks on.)

IRAQI PILOT: (Translated from Arabic) I’m locked on!

(He fires a missle and a huge fireball erupts in the sky.)

(Translated from Arabic) I got him!




SCENE 2
HAKKARI, TURKEY; NATO SURVEILLANCE STATION; TURKEY/IRAQ BORDER
(Various military calls can be heard over the radio. There are officers sleeping. The lights grow a dimmer and a loud explosion is heard outside. The two men run over to the window and see the UFO exploding in the forest.)

1ST OFFICER: Oh, man.

(The second officer pulls up a seat at the radio and picks up the headphones.)

2ND OFFICER: This is Southern Crescent to Red Crescent. We’ve got a downed plane at camp perimeter.

RADIO: This is Red Crescent, that’s a negative, we have nothing in the sky at this time.

(The second officer looks back out the window briefly.)

2ND OFFICER: Well, we’ve got something down here. Advise Medivac unit to be on stand-by, we’re going to check it out.

RADIO: Roger.

(The two officers get up and put their hats on. The 1st Officer takes a fire extinguisher. The 2nd takes a first aid-kit.)

RADIO: Medivac One, Medivac One, this is Red Crescent, vector one reports downed aircraft in their area, over.

(Another UFO flies down and hovers over the crash site.)




SCENE 3
12:20 A.M. CENTRAL TIME; ROUTE 100; REAGAN, TENNESSEE
(An unmarked truck drives down the road.)

MAN ON C.B.: Breaker, breaker, this is Big Flight, anybody out there with me, come back to me, over.

WOMAN ON C.B.: I read you loud and clear, this is Betty Blue, come on…

(The truck driver turns on the radio.)

RADIO: From Opryland, it’s the Grand Old Opry on WSM Radio 650. Brought to you by Goody’s Headache Powder. When the night’s been too long and the party’s been too hardy, Goody’s Headache Powder will straighten you right out.

(The truck driver looks down at his shotgun in the passenger seat.)

And you have my word on that. Good evening…

(The radio grows very statticy and the channels rapidly change. The driver fiddles around with the controls, but to no avail. He turns it off.)

C.B. MALE CALLER #1: I saw it, it was cigar-shaped, red and green lights, fast as hell.

C.B. FEMALE CALLER: I seen three of them flying over Chester County.

C.B. MALE CALLER #2: Right, right, and six troopers were chasing them down 22! Whoa, I see one now! And he’s over the watertower!

(The driver looks up at the C.B., then hears sirens. A police car races by his truck.)

C.B. FEMALE CALLER: I see him too! Red and green lights, just like you said!

(The C.B. grows garbled when suddenly everything in the truck shuts off. The truck skids along the road as the driver desperately tries to stop and steer the truck on the road. It finally stops, and the driver looks at the sky, takes his shotgun and flashlight, and gets out of the car. Another loud hum can be heard. He cocks his gun and walks around to the back. Looking up, he sees a UFO. The cargo doors behind him swing opening, revealing various brown boxes. He spins around and shines the flashlight. Some bushes near him start rustling, and he shoots his gun at the bushes three times.)




SCENE 4
ROUTE 100; REAGAN, TENNESSEE
(It is now morning. A person starts two stopwatches, leaving one on the truck. He pulls out a geiger counter and takes his backpack. We see it is Mulder. Scully picks up a shell off the ground and puts in an evidence bag. Mulder turns on the counter and starts walking around. The counter clicks.)

SCULLY: From the trucker’s description, the shape he fired on could conceivably have been a mountain lion.

MULDER: Conceivably.

SCULLY: The National Weather Service last night reported atmospheric conditions in this area that were possibly conducive to lightning.

MULDER: Possibly.

(The clicking grows stronger. Scully takes a picture of another shell on the ground. The geiger counter goes off the charts at a leaf that was crushed by something.)

SCULLY: It is feasible that the truck was struck by lightning, creating the electrical failure.

MULDER: It’s feasible.

(He opens an evidence bag and takes a sample of the leaf. Scully stands up.)

SCULLY: And you know, there’s a marsh over there. The lights the driver saw may have been swamp gas.

MULDER: Swamp gas?

SCULLY: It’s a natural phenonemon in which phospine and methane rising from decaying organic matter ignite, creating globes of blue flame.

(She crosses over to him.)

MULDER: Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs. How can a dozen witnesses including a squad of police vehicles in three counties become hysterical over swamp gas?

(He gets up and walks back to the car. Scully follows.)

I’ve investigated multiple sitings before: Chespeake Bay, the Okoboji Lakes, Area 51 in Nevada. None had this much supporting evidence. Anecdotal data, exhume residue, radiation levels five times the norm.

SCULLY: Mulder, none of that evidence is conclusive.

MULDER: The only question for me is, why was the truck driver singled out?

SCULLY: Isn’t it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver became swept up in the hysteria and fired at hallucinations? I mean, after all, the road can play tricks on you.

MULDER: Yeah, it can play tricks on you. But not like this.

(Mulder stops both stopwatches. He places them down on the truck.)

I started these stopwatches at the same time.

(The one on the left, that he had taken with him, reads around 37 seconds. The one on the right, that he had left on the truck, reads about 28.)




SCENE 5
POLICE STATION; LEXINGTON, TENNESSEE
(The truck driver, named Ranheim, is sitting in an interrogation room with Mulder and Scully. The driver has rashes all over his face.)

RANHEIM: I don’t know why they’re holding me. This “firing a weapon on a county road” charge is a lot of house manure. I’m a vet and I know how to handle a gun.

MULDER: Mr. Ranheim, I’d appreciate it if you could elaborate on the report you filed last night regarding your encounter.

(Ranheim rubs his eye and sighs. Pause.)

RANHEIM: Like a saucer and green and orange lights.

MULDER: Last night, you said it was cigar-shaped and black.

RANHEIM: I didn’t ask for this to happen.

(coughs)

All I want to do is deliver my shipment of auto parts and forget…

(He coughs wildly. Mulder and Scully watch momentarily, then Scully pours him some water. She pushes it over to him.)

SCULLY: Pardon me for asking, but how long have you had that cough?

(He pushes the water back.)

RANHEIM: Why?

SCULLY: I’m just concerned, you said you were a veteran.

RANHEIM: What’s that got to do with this?

SCULLY: The cough, the fever, the rash. Those are all symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome.

RANHEIM: I was never in the Gulf War.

MULDER: Ok. So, how long have you not been yourself?

(Pause.)

RANHEIM: Since the thing last night.

(Mulder is about to ask another question when a man in a suit, Police Chief Rivers, walks in with an officer.)

RIVERS: Mr. Ranheim, I’m Police Chief Rivers.

(He shakes Ranheim’s hand.)

Please, forgive the misunderstanding. Your truck’s squared away. You may go.

MULDER: I’d like to examine the truck.

RIVERS: That won’t be necessary.

(Ranheim gets up and leaves. Mulder starts to follow.)

MULDER: This man has had an alleged close encounter. The truck undoubtedly contains important trace evidence.

(Ranheim stops Mulder.)

Sir! If I may…

RIVERS: You’ve gotten all you’re going to get out of this county. We will no longer cooperate in your investigation.

SCULLY: Why?

RIVERS: Just… go away.

(He leaves. Scully looks at Mulder and is about to say something.)

MULDER: Not… not here.

(They take their things, and Mulder holds the door for Scully as they leave. He closes the door behind him.)




SCENE 6
AIRPORT; TENNESSEE
(A man prints out a rent-a-car slip for the agents and hands it to Scully, who starts filling it out. Behind them, a woman is shaking her pen, which is obviously not working. She is trying to fill out a form as well. Her son is standing next to her and her daughter is sitting on the desk.)

MULDER: It’s obvious someone got to the police chief. Ranheim was hiding something.

SCULLY: Ranheim was sick.

MULDER: He only became sick last night.

(A woman walks up to Scully.)

WOMAN: Excuse me, can I use your pen?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

(She hands the pen to the woman.)

What are you suggesting, that Gulf War Syndrome is caused by UFOs?

MULDER: UFOs are frequently witnessed by soldiers during wartime.

(The woman hands the pen back.)

WOMAN: Thanks.

(The two agents start off towards the bus.)

SCULLY: Mulder, the only UFOs people are likely to see are secret military aircraft.

MULDER: What if that’s what made the soldiers in Iraq sick? The exhaust or fuel from a classified aircraft or its weapon.

(They board the bus and sit down.)

SCULLY: Well, there is a base in Little Rock. You think that’s what the Air Force was flying that night?

MULDER: They’d deny it, but it could possibly explain how Ranheim developed his symptoms.

SCULLY: Possibly.

(The bus starts moving.)

MULDER: I want to talk to some people when we get back to Washington.

SCULLY: Mulder, the military isn’t going to talk about classified aircraft.

MULDER: No, these guys are like an extreme government watchdog group. They publish a magazine called “The Lone Gunman.” Some of their information is first-rate; covert actions, classified weapons. Some of their ideas are downright spooky.




SCENE 7
THE LONE GUNMEN’S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder and Scully are sitting in front of the window. A man named Langly, long hair, unshaven, Ramones t-shirt on, is walking around. Another man named Byers, clean-cut, moustache and beard, suit and tie, is standing in the corner. The third man, named Frohike, is small and toad-like, takes a picture of Scully.)

LANGLY: So, check it out, Mulder, today I had breakfast with the guy who shot John F. Kennedy.

MULDER: Is that so?

LANGLY: Old dude now, but yeah. Says he was dressed as a cop on the grassy knoll.

BYERS: And, Mulder, listen to this. Vladmir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Russian Social Democrats? He’s being put into power by the most heinous and evil force of the 20th century.

MULDER: Barney?

(Scully smiles, Langly chuckles. Byers seems unamused.)

BYERS: The C.I.A.

SCULLY: Hmm.

LANGLY: Is this your skeptical partner?

(Frohike takes another picture.)

FROHIKE: She’s hot.

BYERS: You don’t believe that the C.I.A., threatened by a loss of power and funding because of the collapse of the cold war, wouldn’t dream of having the old enemy back?

SCULLY: I think you give the government too much credit.

(The phone rings. Langly walks over and picks up the phone and turns on a tape recorder.)

I mean, the government can’t control the defecit or manage crime…

LANGLY: (into phone) Lone Gunman.

SCULLY: …what makes you think they could plan and execute such an elaborate conspiracy?

FROHIKE: She is hot.

MULDER: Settle down, Frohike.

(Byers walks over to them.)

BYERS: I’m not talking about the bunch of idiots up on the hill trying to bone the capital pages. We’re talking about a dark network, a government within a government, controlling our every move.

SCULLY: How can they do that?

BYERS: How? I’ll show you how. You got a twenty dollar bill?

SCULLY: Hmmm… I’ll check.

(She digs into her back pocket, looking at Mulder, who smiles back. She pulls out a twenty.)

Um-hmmm.

(She hands it to Byers and he goes over to the table. Mulder waves his hands like “I don’t know.”)

LANGLY: (still on phone) Uh-huh… yeah…

(Byers holds the bill in front of him and rips off its left side. Scully crosses over to him. Langly can still be heard intellegibly in the background.)

SCULLY: Hey!

(Mulder laughs. Scully looks back at him. Byers pulls out the magnetic anti-counterfeiting strip.)

BYERS: That’s just one method. They use this magnetic strip to track you. Whenever you go through a metal detector at an airport, they know exactly how much you’re carrying.

MULDER: Hey, Byers, it is a federal crime to deface money.

(Scully crosses back to Mulder, holding the ripped bill. Langly hangs up.)

SCULLY: This strip is an anti-counterfeiting measure.

LANGLY: How come it’s on the inside? Other countries put that strip on the outside.

BYERS: What are they hiding?

(Mulder waves his hands to get their attention.)

MULDER: O… o… ok, alright. What do you know about the Gulf War Syndrome?

LANGLY: Agent Orange of the 90’s.

BYERS: Artillery shells coated with depleted uranium.

MULDER: Have you heard of any classified planes being flown during the Persian Gulf War?

BYERS: Why would you need to expose a secret plane to an air force that runs to Iran whenever you take to the air?

MULDER: What about UFO activity during that period?

(Langly and even Byers laugh.)

LANGLY: Yeah, UFOs caused the Gulf War Syndrome, that’s a good one.

BYERS: That’s why we like you, Mulder, your ideas are weirder than ours.

(Mulder laughs a bit. Scully nods her head slightly in agreement.)




SCENE 8
X-FILES OFFICE; F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is looking at the picture she took of the shell on the ground with a magnifying glass and another one of the road. Scully is writing.)

SCULLY: Those were the most paranoid people I have ever met. I don’t know how you could think that what they say is even remotely plausible.

MULDER: I think it’s remotely plausible that someone might think you’re hot.

(Scully looks at Mulder. She shakes her pen and smiles. It still doesn’t write, so she pulls out ink and unscrews her pen.)

SCULLY: Did you see the way they answered the telephone? They probably think that every call that they get is monitored and they’re followed wherever they go. It’s a form of self-delusion. It makes them think that what they’re doing is important enough that somebody would…

(She looks at her pen, which has various forms of circuitry in it.)

MULDER: What’s the matter?

(He looks back and crosses over to Scully, who is holding the pen with her hand on her desk. Mulder kneels down and pulls her hand closer, inspecting the pen. It contains a listening device.)




SCENE 9
MULDER’S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder walks over to his light, unscrews the lightbulb and puts in a blue one. He opens the blinds, turns off all the other lights and sits down. The blue glow can be seen from outside. Hours have seemingly passed, and Mulder is asleep on the couch. The phone rings and Mulder wakes up. He gets up, crosses to his desk and picks up the phone.)

MULDER: Hello?

(A click is heard.)




SCENE 10
LINCOLN MEMORIAL; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is sitting on a park bench, eating an apple. Deep Throat walks up behind him and sits down.)

DEEP THROAT: Pitchers and catchers report for spring training this week.

MULDER: Yeah. What are we doing here?

(Deep Throat chuckles.)

DEEP THROAT: Missed your calling, did you, Mr. Mulder? Ah, maybe this year we can catch a game at Camden Yards. Of course, we wouldn’t be able to sit together.

MULDER: That’s too bad. Something tells me you have the connections to get great seats.

DEEP THROAT: Any park in the country.

(A camera clicks. Deep Throat quickly turns away, facing Mulder, to avoid more pictures.)

MULDER: It’s just a tourist.

DEEP THROAT: In our line, nothing is just what it seems.

MULDER: What am I onto? We go down to investigate a truck driver’s encounter with a UFO and the next thing, we’re discovering electronic surveillance equipment. Who’s listening to us?

(Deep Throat looks at him, then turns away.)

Why won’t you tell me?

(Deep Throat sighs, pulls an envelope out of his trenchcoat, hands it to Mulder and walks away.)

What am I onto?

(Deep Throat stops and turns a bit.)

DEEP THROAT: A dangerous path.

(He keeps walking.)




SCENE 11
X-FILES OFFICE; F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is reading a paper that reads this at the top:

SUBJECT: Response to Request for Inf --
Contact and Other Related I --
Via: INTERCEPT IRAQI TRANSMISSION
TO: Commanding Officer, Majestic Project,”

The folder it is in reads “TOP SECRET.” We can hear the fight between the Iraqi pilot and the UFO in the background, we then switch to the same shots as before: the flash, the man screaming, the shot and the UFO explosion in the air. Scully walks in. She crosses over, hands some papers to Mulder, and sits down.)

SCULLY: The truck is bogus. And so’s the truck driver, Ranheim. First I checked his manifest. It listed a truck carrying 180 cartons of auto parts weighing 3,100 pounds. Then I checked with three weigh stations along his route and they have it listed at 5,100 pounds. There’s something in that truck, Mulder, and it’s not auto parts. And of course, nobody ever reported him. Furthermore, Ranheim lied about being in the Gulf War. His real name is Frank Druce – and I worked hard to get this one. He was Special Operations Black Beret in Mosul, northern Iraq. Also, he didn’t get sick from the encounter the other night. He’s been to the V.A. hospital for treatment three times this past year.

(Mulder shakes his head angrily.)

MULDER: We had it.

(He gets up.)

We had it and we let it go. Four days ago, an Iraqi pilot shot down an unidentified flying object. The wreckage, and possibly the occupants, were recovered by the army. Ranheim, the truck driver, would be the perfect escort for the wreckage and/or bodies out of Iraq and into a laboratory in the United States. That would explain why the truck weighs so much more than listed. The military has, in the past, transported dangerous materials and weapons across the country.

(He laughs. Scully looks perplexed.)

I’m beginning to sound like those guys at “The Lone Gunman,” right?

SCULLY: Where did you obtain this information?

MULDER: Let’s just say it’s a source with a deep background.

(Pause. Mulder sits down next to her.)

SCULLY: I want to know all about him.

MULDER: All I know is that he’s guided us away from harm.

SCULLY: How do you know that? We work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and we’re being bugged. What does that tell you?

MULDER: That tells me that not everything is as it appears to be.

SCULLY: Exactly. And for all we know, this “deep background” is the one responsible for the bug.

MULDER: He’s never lied to me. I won’t break that confidence. I trust him.

SCULLY: Mulder, you’re the only one I trust.

MULDER: Then you’re gonna have to trust me.

(Pause. Scully leans back in her chair.)

Did you find out where the truck is now?

SCULLY: Generally. It’s heading west. Towards Colorado.

MULDER: Ok, we’ve got to try and intercept it and see what’s on board.

(He gets up.)

I’m gonna go get a few things, I’ll meet you back at your place in an hour, okay?

(He takes his coat, then puts his hand on her shoulder. He walks out and she leans forward onto the desk.)




SCENE 12
MULDER’S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder unlocks his door and walks in. He tries the light switch, but it doesn’t work.)

DEEP THROAT: I cut the main breaker.

(Mulder is about to pull his gun when he sees it is Deep Throat sitting in a chair. He sighs, closes the door and crosses over to him.)

MULDER: You risked exposure coming here.

(Deep Throat takes out another envelope.)

DEEP THROAT: What I have here is too important.

(He stands up, crosses over and hands Mulder the envelope.)

The photograph in that envelope was taken by an officer in Fort Benning, Georgia. 17 UFOs were spotted in one hour.

MULDER: Is that where the Iraqi wreckage is being held? Are UFOs monitoring the area?

DEEP THROAT: Nice place you have here.

(He turns and opens the door.)

MULDER: Wait, wait.

(Deep Throat stops in the doorway and looks back at Mulder.)

I, I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you. You’ve helped my work so much and never asked for anything in return. I know you’ve put yourself at great risk to do so.

(Deep Throat looks a bit ashamed and leaves, closing the door behind him. Mulder crosses over to the table and picks up the envelope. Opening it, he finds the picture.)




SCENE 13
SCULLY’S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(The picture is of a policeman standing by a car with trees in the background. The UFO hovers above the trees next to the moon. The UFO is clearly visible in the windshield. Scully is looking at it with a magnifying glass.)

MULDER: This is the best photographic evidence I have ever seen. When I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos, I knew they were a hoax but this… this is the quality of evidence the government has amassed for decades at the highest classified levels. That business with the truck was just a decoy to keep anyone from looking closely away from Fort Benning where they are keeping the remains of the Iraqi UFO. We have to leave for Georgia immediately, Scully…

SCULLY: Mulder, this photograph is a fake.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Look.

(He kneels down and she shows him the policeman through the magnifying glass.)

This soldier’s shadow is alledgedly created by the lights from the UFO. But it falls in a direction contradictory to the craft’s position.

MULDER: There can be an off-camera light source creating that shadow.

SCULLY: Now look closely at the color of the light reflected in the windshield. Now that reflection should be from the red lights in the UFO but it doesn’t match the color of the ship’s light.

MULDER: There’s probably a degree of tint in the windshield or the gradation could be attributed to atmospheric conditions.

SCULLY: We should have it analyzed.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: Why don’t you just admit it, Scully? You’re determined not to believe him.

SCULLY: Well, maybe you’re too determined to believe him.

(Mulder collects the pictures and takes his coat.)

MULDER: I am determined to follow a lead that may result in proof of the existence of extraterrestrial biological entities. I need to go.

(He starts off.)

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me.

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Please, will you just hear me?

(She stands. He stops and turns around.)

I have never met anyone so passionate and dedicated to a belief as you. It’s so intense that sometimes it’s blinding. But there are others who are watching you, who know what I know and whereas I can respect and admire your passion, they will use it against you. Mulder, the truth is out there but so are lies.

MULDER: Thank you.

(He turns and leaves.)




SCENE 14
8:30 A.M. EASTERN TIME; F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Scully opens the door to her office, puts down her coat and briefcase, takes her cup and goes to get coffee. She pours some, then some sugar and then she stirs it. She returns to the room and is shocked to see that the desk lamp is on and her briefcase is now laying down on the desk instead of standing up. She turns to see Mulder walking towards her, photo in hand.)

MULDER: I had the photo analyzed by the bureau’s computers. Initially, it appears to be legitimate. The film grain matches, the pattern and density, color levels, shading… then I noticed this.

(He sits down and shows her the moon in the picture. He then shows her the reflection.)

It’s the moon, half full. I had the reflection in this window enlarged to 25. There’s the moon again, a quarter full. Not to mention the fact that the window couldn’t even catch the moon’s reflection from that angle. You were right, Scully. It’s a fake. He tried to decieve us. Now we’re alone on this. There’s no one we can trust. They went to a lot of trouble to put us on the wrong track. There’s something here that no one’s supposed to find.




SCENE 15
AN AQUARIUM; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is standing at the shark tank, watching them swim. Deep Throat comes over.)

DEEP THROAT: Why didn’t you leave for Fort Benning?

MULDER: The photograph was a fake.

(No response.)

At least you’re not insulting me further by feigning appaled surprise.

DEEP THROAT: On the contrary, I think a compliment is in order. That photo was performed by our very best.

MULDER: I thought you were my ally.

DEEP THROAT: Oh, I am.

MULDER: Yeah, imagine if Eisenhower told the rest of the Allies that D-Day would take place in Belgium.

DEEP THROAT: (angrier) Mr. Mulder, I place my life in great jeopardy every time we speak.

(Mulder looks away, calmer.)

I’ve been a participant in some of the most insidious lies and witness to deeds that no crazed man could imagine. I spent years watching you from my, uh, lofty position to know that you were the one I could trust.

MULDER: Then why did you lie to me?

DEEP THROAT: I needed to divert you. You and Scully are excellent investigators and your motives are just. However, there are still some secrets that should remain secret – some truths that people are just not ready to know.

MULDER: Who are you to decide that for me?

DEEP THROAT: The world’s reaction to such knowledge would be far too dangerous.

MULDER: Dangerous. You mean in a sense of outrage like the reaction to the Kennedy assassinations or M.I.A.s or radiation experiments on terminal patients, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee experiments, where will it end? Oh, I guess it won’t end as long as… men like you decide what is truth. That transcript you gave me of the Iraqi pilot, that was the truth, wasn’t it?

DEEP THROAT: Hmmmp. (in agreement.)

MULDER: Why’d you even bother to show it to me?

DEEP THROAT: Well, I knew that you were onto the truck so I knew that down the road I would have to steer you away. That I would have to lie to you. And a lie, Mr. Mulder, is most convincingly hidden between two truths.

(Mulder starts to walk away.)

Mulder.

(Mulder turns back.)

When a shark stops swimming, it will die. Don’t stop swimming. I’m not responsible for the electronic surveillance but I do know they can still hear you.

(Deep Throat walks away. Mulder watches the sharks swim.)




SCENE 16
MULDER’S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder tears apart his apartment looking for the surveillance. He finally finds the bug by unscrewing the plug fixture in the wall. The doorbell rings.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Are you home?

(Mulder goes to the door and opens it.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, glad you could drop by.

SCULLY: Mul…

(Mulder signals for her to be quiet and leads her into the room.)

MULDER: I been thinking about this whole situation, y’know? And I think you’re right. I think we won this one, I think we should just move on.

(He points down at the fixture. Scully kneels down, looks at it and stands up. Mulder rights on some paper “We have to find the truck.” Scully nods in agreement.)

SCULLY: I think this time you’re right, Mulder.




SCENE 17
STREET; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder and Scully drive down a busy street and pull over to the side. Another car keeps going and pulls over two cars ahead of them. Scully gets out of the passenger seat, as does a man from the other car. Mulder pulls out and drives down the street. The other car follows him. Scully starts to walk and looks back, seeing the man tail her. She signals for a taxi, gets in, and drives away.)

MAN: Taxi!

(He signals for the next taxi, but the taxi doesn’t stop.)




SCENE 18
9:16 A.M. EASTERN TIME; DULLES AIRPORT; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Scully is standing on line, buying tickets. The woman hands her a ticket.)

WOMAN: Here you are, Ms. Scully, your round-trip ticket to Chicago.

(She hands Scully her credit card, which Scully puts in her pocketbook along with the ticket.)

And your credit card, and the plane departs at Gate 35.

SCULLY: I’d also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles with a stop at Las Vegas, and I’ll be paying cash.




SCENE 19
STREET; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Mulder is still being tailed by the man in the car. He comes to a red light and looks in his rearview mirror, seing the car two cars behind him. The light turns green and Mulder jams on the accelerator, making a sharp left turn, causing traffic to swerve to avoid him. The other car cannot follow for the moment, but eventually gets through. Mulder heads for the airport.)




SCENE 20
11:30 A.M. PACIFIC TIME; MCCARRAN AIRPORT; LAS VEGAS, NEVADA
(Scully is in the gift shop, looking at the small books. Mulder nonchalantly walks by, and neither acknowledge each other. Mulder heads for the magazine racks, and Scully follows. They both pick up magazines, pretending to read.)

MULDER: Called every weigh station and bureau office west of Colorado. Tied up an airphone for three hours. I don’t speak Japanese, but I think some businessman told me to stick a piece of sushi where the sun don’t shine.

SCULLY: My ear’s numb from being on hold for so many hours.

MULDER: At least we can be sure they didn’t trace our call. I couldn’t find the truck. Did you have any luck?

SCULLY: Yep. It’s heading northwest on I-90.




SCENE 21
6:30 P.M. PACIFIC TIME; JUNCTION OF HIGHWAYS 90 & 283; WASHINGTON STATE
(The truck heads down I-90. Mulder and Scully are waiting in their rental car. Scully is looking through binoculars, and Mulder is eating sunflower seeds.)

MULDER: Y’know, think about it. This truck drove across America. People it passed on the road probably thought it was hauling auto parts or furniture. Y’know, livestock, whatever. Nobody would have suspected it was hauling a craft from another world.

SCULLY: Here we go.

(Scully lowers her binoculars as the truck passes by. Mulder starts the car and they turn onto the highway. Much later, they are still chasing the car. It is now dark outside. Mulder yawns.)

Mulder, we’ve been following this truck for hours. Maybe he knows we’re following him, and he’s taking an evasive route.

MULDER: Well, if that were the case…

(The radio turns on and starts flipping through channels rapidly. Hail starts hitting the car, there is a loud hum, and then a bright light. The car stops suddenly in front of the truck, which is now vacant and turned around. Mulder gets out of the car with his flashlight.)

MULDER: You all right?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Come on.

(Scully gets out of the car.)

SCULLY: Ranheim? Ranheim?

(They go to the back of the truck. The doors are open. Climbing in, they start moving boxes. Mulder pushes through until he is faced with a bright red glow. Scully is close behind.)

MULDER: Scully?

(They are looking at what looks to be a life-support unit.)

SCULLY: Oh my God.

MULDER: It was an extraterrestrial biological entity… alive.

SCULLY: Where’d it go?

MULDER: I think we were just witness to a rescue mission.

(They look at the tubing and the platform where the alien was laying. Mulder start another stopwatch on the ground outside the truck then goes into and climbs out of the truck, having used his geiger counter. Scully is holding the flashlight. They start walking to the stopwatch.)

SCULLY: God, Mulder, I can’t stop shaking. What we just saw – did it fit the profile?

MULDER: Are you asking me if it was real? Did we just have a close encounter?

(She nods yes. They stop. He bends down and picks up the stopwatch. He pulls out another stopwatch that had been going and stops them both.)

No, it was another hoax.

(He shows them to Scully. They both read 38. They start walking back to the car.)

SCULLY: But how could anyone generate such force?

MULDER: Whatever they used, we probably haven’t heard of it. Sound weapons, stealth helicopters with an ultra-intensity light. It doesn’t matter, there’s no evidence that this was a UFO.

SCULLY: So they created this elaborate show just to deflect us again. I mean, wouldn’t it have been easier just for them to –

MULDER: Just to kill us? Yeah, I wondered that myself. Maybe they’re using me against myself like you said before. That I want to believe so badly that I’d just accept the obvious conclusions and walk away.

(They stop at the car.)

SCULLY: Now we have nothing to go on. No one to turn to.

MULDER: There’s still one person in all this who hasn’t lied to us. But it’s not quite someone we can turn to.




SCENE 22
HOTEL ROOM; WASHINGTON STATE
(Scully is writing at the desk. Mulder is on the phone with various maps in front of him.)

MULDER: (into phone) Leverling and Priest Rapids? East bank of the Columbia River? Did you send a field investigator? And you can substantiate the sighting? Ok, Nick, thanks a lot.

(He hangs up and crosses to Scully with a map.)

I’ve contacted several organizations that have hotlines for UFO reports. Center of UFO Studies in Chicago, MUFON, NICAP… none of them have ever reported a week of such activity. It began in Tennessee where Ranheim was encountered.

(He traces his finger down the line where the truck went, which is covered with red circles marking UFO sightings.)

SCULLY: The sightings are following the path of the truck.

MULDER: And after last night’s hoax… look at this.

(He takes out another map and circles another spot.)

Seven sightings in Mattawa, Washington. That’s 100 miles away.

SCULLY: Aliens?

MULDER: Looks like they want their colleague back.




SCENE 23
MATTAWA, WASHINGTON STATE
(Mulder and Scully are driving in their car.)

SCULLY: We’ve driven full circle through Mattawa twice. There’s nothing here.

(Mulder spots something and stops the car.)

MULDER: What’s over there?

(About 20 people are gathered around a fire in the woods. Loud music is blasting. Mulder and Scully get out of the car and go to the center of the campsite. There is a sign that says “Welcome, Space Brothers.” Many people are dressed like aliens as well.)

GUY IN ALIEN SUIT: We have been waiting! Welcome to our home! We are willing to go with you!

(Mulder waves to some people. They stop at a man dressed in all red carrying a beer.)

MAN: Ahh-doo-nay-va-so barahghas. That’s an intergalactic space greeting. That means, “hello, space brothers.”

MULDER: Hello.

SCULLY: What’s going on here?

MAN: A UFO party.

MULDER: You’ve seen UFOs?

MAN: The last two nights. They’re drawn to our electric power. They hover over our power plant down there.

(He points to the power plant.)

GUY IN ALIEN SUIT: Everyone! They are here! Space brothers!

(Mulder and Scully look at the plant. Ranheim is being led through a gate by a cop.)

COP: Alright. Back it up.

(Mulder and Scully are in the car. Mulder is looking through the binoculars.)

MULDER: This is it. There’s Ranheim.

SCULLY: This place has got to have the highest level of security.

MULDER: Just the kind of challenge they’re looking for.

SCULLY: Who?

(Mulder starts dials the phone. At “The Lone Gunman” Office, Langly picks up.)

LANGLY: Lone Gunman.

MULDER: It’s Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off.

(Langly pauses.)

LANGLY: Ok, it’s off.

MULDER: Turn it off!

LANGLY: It’s off already.

MULDER: How would you like to have, on your front page, the first substantiated photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity?

LANGLY: No way, an E.B.E.? What do we have to do?

MULDER: Just hack me some identification numbers.




SCENE 24
POWER PLANT; MATTAWA, WASHINGTON STATE
(We see a printer printing up two security passes that read:

SECURITY PASS

Northwest Facility
Mattawa, WA

P.I.N. NAME	LEVEL
7593	Braidwood, Tom	5
5311	Stefoff, Val 5

AUTHORIZED FOR SECURITY ACCESS
LEVEL INDICATED ABOVE

MULDER: Braidwood and Stefoff.

(A man tears off a pass and comes out of the booth.)

MAN: Personal identification number?

MULDER: 7-5-9-3.

SCULLY: 5-3-1-1.

MAN: Open the trunk, please.

(Mulder pops the trunk as the man goes to the back of the car. He looks through the trunk and closes it.)

Park in Lot 4.

(He puts a sticker on the windshield.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(The gate opens and Mulder starts the car. As they start to go through, the man comes out of the booth again.)

MAN: Hey, wait!

(Mulder and Scully look at each other. The man comes up the window with two clip-on passes.)

Display these at all times. Proceed.

(Mulder takes them and nods. The two walk through hallways where phones are ringing.)

MULDER: Langly said he couldn’t get into Level 6, so that’s where we…

(They spot a security guard in front of a door which states:

“LEVEL 6
CLEARANCE
AA ACCESS
ONLY”

They keep walking until they get to a pair of double doors. They stop.)

MULDER: We have to go back, we have to go through that door.

SCULLY: We’re gonna look suspicious going back.

MULDER: Well, we’ll have to find another access, then. Come on.

SCULLY: Mulder, they’re not going to let us.

(They turn around to head back but are met by the security guard.)

SECURITY GUARD: You folks come with me, please?

MULDER: Yeah, we’re lost, we’re just looking for, we’re trying to…

SECURITY GUARD: Just proceed down the hallway.

MULDER: Yeah, if you could help us…

SCULLY: Mulder, stop. We’re agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(She reaches for her badge, he reaches for his gun.)

I’m reaching for my ID.

(He nods, she shows it.)

We’re here conducting an investigation.

SECURITY GUARD: Proceed down the hallway, please.

(Scully sighs and they all walk down the hallway. The guard starts talking into his walkie-talkie.)

This is Level Two to Level Six. I have a male and a female who have identified themselves…

(Mulder runs to the Level Six door. The guard pulls out his gun but Scully blocks his line of fire.)

SCULLY: Mulder, no!

SECURITY GUARD: Hey, stop!

(The guard shoves Scully out of his way. Mulder opens the door and dashes down the stairs. Many other guards with assault rifles charge the hall.)

He took the stairs! Go, go, go!

(The guards rush down the stairs, And the guard takes scully away. Mulder passes a sign that says:

NO ENTRY UNLESS:

1. Accompanied By a Staff Member Of High Voltage Research.
Or 2. Written Permission Obtained From Security Level 6”

The security guards are close behind.)

SECURITY GUARD #2: C’mon guys!

(Mulder, about to go down a catwalk, tries to jump over a sign that says “DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE” but misses and hurts his leg. He gets up and limps down the catwalk.)

Stay armed and loaded!

(Mulder enters a room with a humongous, futuristic machine in the middle, with a red glass pane on one of the walls.)

Hold it! I said hold it!

(He limps over, but before he can look inside, the guards surround him.)

Halt!

(The guards cock their guns and Mulder turns around. One grabs him by the wrist and takes Mulder’s gun. Mulder puts his hands up.)

DEEP THROAT: Let him go.

(Deep Throat walks in, carrying a gun.)

Let him go! You’ve done well. You’re dismissed.

(The guards walk out. Deep Throat takes Mulder’s gun back and gives it to‚ Mulder, who warily takes it.)

I know how badly, how… very badly you want to look through that window…

(Mulder tries to look, but Deep Throat gets in his way.)

But it would be pointless. It’s dead. After the Roswell incident in 1947, even at the brink of the Cold War, there was an ultrasecret conference attended by the United States, the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China, Britain, both Germanies, France and it was agreed that should any extraterrestrial biological entity survive a crash, the country that held that being would be responsible for it’s extermination. I, uh… have the distinction of being one of three men to have exterminated such a creature.

(Mulder looks at him in awe, yet betrayed. Deep Throat walks around.)

I was with the C.I.A. in Vietnam. A UFO was sighted for five nights over Hanoi. The marines shot hit down and brought it to us. Maybe… it didn’t know what a gun was or perhaps they don’t show emotion but that… innocent and blank expression as I pulled the trigger has haunted me… until I found you. That’s why I come to you, Mr. Mulder, and will continue to come to you to atone for what I’ve done. And maybe sometime, through you, the truth will be known.

(Mulder looks through the window. There is an empty cot. Deep Throat looks through as well. The doors to the outside open and Mulder and Deep Throat step outside.)

You’re awfully quiet, Mr. Mulder.

MULDER: I’m wondering which lie to believe.

(Deep Throat chuckles and walks off. The security guard shows Scully out, who crosses to Mulder. They watch Deep Throat walk off, shrouded in fog.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
KENWOOD, TENNESSEE, 1983
(A fire is raging in a building, and the fire chief is directing operations.)

FIRE CHIEF: Hurry and get him out of there. I need two men on the left side, now. (to an E.M.T. pushing a stretcher) Wait a second. Where are you going with him?

E.M.T.: He's dead.

FIRE CHIEF: Well, there's a woman over there who isn't, and she needs some oxygen.

(The E.M.T. leaves the stretcher. As policemen hold the crowd back, Reverend Samuel Hartley and a young boy, Samuel, make their way to the stretcher.)

FIRE CHIEF: (in background) Get on the horn, let them know we can release the hook and ladder in five minutes.

(Hartley unzips the body bag on the stretcher, and a lifeless, charred arm falls out.)

SAMUEL: I want you to rise. Rise up and heal!

FIRE CHIEF: (approaching them) What the hell are you doing?

REVEREND HARTLEY: The boy's laying on hands.

SAMUEL: Rise up and accept the miracle He has given you.

(Samuel holds the lifeless hand in his.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Amen. Hallelujah.

SAMUEL: I have the Holy Spirit of God within me tonight.

FIRE CHIEF: You don't understand. The man's dead.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Then the boy can't possibly do any harm, now can he?

SAMUEL: For this is the power of belief, the power to separate the light from the darkness. To create life from death.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Amen.

FIRE CHIEF: All right, everyone! Show's over! Let's clear the area! Go on home! Let's start getting that 1-inch back in the truck.

(The crowd begins to disperse and the fire chief walks away. The lifeless hand suddenly moves, reaching up and clasping Samuel's hand.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Hallelujah, Samuel. Hallelujah.




SCENE 2
(Scully is playing a video tape for Mulder. On it, Reverend Hartley is starting a Miracle Ministry revival in a tent. As the crowd sings and claps, he comes down the aisle to the stage.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Yes, indeedy, oh hallelujah! Hallellujah, praise God! Yes, indeedy, praise God! Yes. I want everybody to say 'Hallelujah'!

CROWD: Hallelujah!

REVEREND HARTLEY: Praise the Lord!

(Scully pauses the tape. There is a woman lying on a table beside Hartley. Behind them sits Samuel.)

SCULLY: The woman on the table has a malignant tumor on her spine. This boy, here, is going to attempt to heal her by simply laying his hands on her.

MULDER: Where'd you get this?

SCULLY: It came in from the regional office in Tennessee. The preacher's name is ...

MULDER: Reverend Calvin Hartley.

SCULLY: You've heard of him?

MULDER: The boy's his adopted son, Samuel. He claims to have found him as an infant lying in the tall weeds on the banks of the muddy Mississippi.

SCULLY: Did you know that he also claims the boy brought a man back from the dead?

MULDER: It's more than a claim. The man he saved appears as a regular attraction in the Reverend's tent ministry. The boy's been performing miracles every week for the past ten years. Twice on Sundays.

SCULLY: Well, not according to the Kenwood Country sheriff. Local authorities think that Reverend Hartley and his son are a scam. They've been trying to shut him down for some time now, but without any luck, so they've turned to the FBI to try and get a prosecution.

MULDER: For what? Fraud?

SCULLY: No, murder. Watch the tape.

(She starts the tape, and Mulder watches while munching sunflower seeds.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Lucy Kelly has the cancer. Her doctors say it is inoperable. They say it is incurable. But I say to you that what the doctors cannot cure, the Lord can. (crowd cheers and shouts 'amen') Yes, indeedy, praise God! Because God can work miracles. Today the clear light of God's healing love is flowing through Samuel's healing hands.

(Samuel has laid his hands on Lucy Kelly. Scully stops the tape.)

SCULLY: Twenty minutes later Lucy Kelly was rushed to the hospital. She was pronounced dead on arrival.

MULDER: What was the cause of death?

SCULLY: I don't know, but it wasn't cancer. They've requested someone with a medical background to assist local police in the investigation. I know this isn't an X-File ...

MULDER: When do we leave for Tennessee?




SCENE 3
MIRACLE MINISTRY, KENWOOD TENNESSEE
(The sign on the front of the tent reads "Reverend Calvin Hartley presents his Miracle Ministry featuring healer Samuel Hartley. Come as you are ... leave as you always wanted to be." Mulder and Scully approach the tent, passing a souvenir stand selling shirts and baseball caps. There is a crowd around the stand and around the entrance to the tent.)

MULDER: I think I saw some of these same people at Woodstock.

SCULLY: (smiling) Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.

MULDER: I saw the movie.

(They give their tickets to a man at the entrance and he hands them flyers. They enter the tent.)

(Nearby, Sheriff Daniels gets out of his van. He walks around to the passenger's door, and his wife Lillian is sitting in the van.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: You all right by yourself?

LILLIAN DANIELS: I'll be fine.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Good. I won't be long.

(He touches her cheek and she smiles at him. The Sheriff walks away. After he leaves, Lillian sighs and looks downward.)

(Hartley is addressing the crowd, which includes Mulder and Scully.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Most of you here today I know as neighbors and as cherished members of our Miracle Ministry. But some of you have come from far away, as far away as (points to one side of the crowd) Pensacola, Florida, (cheers) and (points toward the other side) Uniondale, Long Island. (more cheers) Wayne Ashton and his family. And it is especially to those of you who come from so far that I must apologize from the bottom of my heart, because unfortunately Samuel cannot be here this afternoon. (groans from the crowd) I know, I know how very deeply disappointed each and every one of you must be feeling right now, but I say unto you, do not be dismayed. Do not despair. Do not lose your hope ... because in two short days, Samuel will be back here at our very special Miracle Mission. (cheers) Yes, indeed, praise God, he will be back here ...

SCULLY: Maybe we should head backstage and see what the Reverend has to say.

MULDER: No, wait, wait, this is the part where they bring out Elvis.

REVEREND HARTLEY: ... on the faithful. Because as these blessed people up here are about to testify, Samuel can heal you. Samuel will heal you, but ... only if you believe. (several in the crowd shout "I believe!")

(Reverend Hartley is exiting from the back of the tent. He is followed by Leonard Vance, who is dressed in black with sunglasses, a black hat and black gloves. A man calls to Hartley as he steps out. Mulder and Scully are waiting for Hartley.)

MAN: Fine sermon, Reverend!

REVEREND HARTLEY: (to Man) God bless you!

SCULLY: (flashing her badge) Reverend Hartley? We're with the FBI.

REVEREND HARTLEY: I see Sheriff Daniels has sent in the cavalry.

SCULLY: We just want to talk to Samuel for a couple of minutes, that's all.

REVEREND HARTLEY: He's not here.

MULDER: Well, where is he?

REVEREND HARTLEY: I don't know. I haven't seen him. The boy's been a bit troubled lately.

VANCE: We're running late, Reverend.

REVEREND HARTLEY: If you'll excuse me ...

(Hartley gets into the back of a white Cadillac. Vance stares at Mulder and Scully for a moment, then gets in the back seat as well. The car, which has license plate "B HEALD", then pulls away, passing Sheriff Daniels. Daniels approaches Mulder and Scully.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Sheriff Daniels. We spoke on the phone.

MULDER: Oh, yeah. This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

(Daniels shakes hands with both.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Right. (to Scully) You requested a copy of the coroner's report.

SCULLY: Right. Thank you.

(Daniels gives her an envelope. Scully opens it and reads the contents as they all walk along.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: I see you folks got a chance to take in the Holy Rollers' Sideshow.

MULDER: Something tells me you're not a member of the Reverend Hartley's flock.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, I remember Hartley when he was a soapbox preacher collecting dollar bills in coffee cans. Since the boy joined the act, he's got himself a Cadillac for every day of the week ... bought for with money that should be used to improve our roads and schools.

MULDER: People want to believe, you know.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Ninety-nine percent of the people in this world are fools ... and the rest of us are in great danger of contagion.

MULDER: Well, even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes, it's still a long way from accusing the boy of murder.

SHERIFF DANIELS: I got witnesses that say the boy was there laying hands on those people when they died.

MULDER: You think that's how he killed them? With a touch?

SHERIFF DANIELS: I don't claim to know how or why he did it. But we've been looking for the boy since Tuesday, and he does not want to be found.

SCULLY: Well, there's nothing out of the ordinary about these reports, except that there were no autopsies performed.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Hartley managed to block my autopsy requests on religious grounds. Also doesn't help that the country coroner is a dues-paying member of the Miracle Ministry.

SCULLY: Well, maybe we can arrange to have the bodies exhumed.




SCENE 4
CEMETERY
(That night, Mulder, Scully, the Sheriff and a deputy are in the cemetery as a backhoe digs up a grave. Mulder looks behind them and sees a group of people approaching, some carrying candles.)

MULDER: Sheriff.

SHERIFF DANIELS: It's Reverend Hartley's group. Damn. I told my people to keep quiet so this wouldn't happen.

MULDER: Looks like you may have a few believers on the payroll.

(The group approaches. They are led by Vance.)

VANCE: On behalf of the Miracle Ministry, we demand that you stop this sacrilege.

SHERIFF DANIELS: You're not just dealing with me any more, Vance. You're dealing with the FBI.

SCULLY: We don't mean you any disrespect. We're investigating a possible homicide, and federal law requires that we do a post-mortem examination on these bodies.

VANCE: I'm afraid we answer to an even higher authority than the U.S. government - one that considers grave digging and defiling corpses mortal sins.

(Vance is still wearing his all-black outfit. The skin on his face is rough, as if from skin grafts.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: We'll get that autopsy, Vance, sooner or later. You know we will.

VANCE: The deceased's family does not want her grave disturbed.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Carol Wallace had no family.

(Daniels has been listening to traffic on his radio. He steps aside to talk to his deputy.)

VANCE: We were her family. We were her family, and it was hard enough to bury her once. So if you insist on going through with this, we are prepared to maintain a vigil and do whatever it takes to stop you.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Mulder? Scully? (they step aside with him) One of my men just spotted the boy's car downtown.

SCULLY: We can't do much here, anyway.

MULDER: Let's go.




SCENE 5
DOWNTOWN
(Their cars arrive downtown.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Not a very likely place to be saving souls.

(They enter a pool hall. A number of chairs are turned over. The proprieter, Zook, is uprighting them.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Where's the boy, Zook?

ZOOK: He's in the can.

SHERIFF DANIELS: What happened here?

ZOOK: That damned fool started a fight. Figures them Bible-thumpers wouldn't know how to hold their liquor.

(Samuel has staggered back to his seat at a table near the bar. His face is bruised. Daniels approaches him. Mulder and Scully follow.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Where you been, Samuel? We've been looking for you.

SAMUEL: (lighting a cigarette) Yeah. I've been thinking.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, you're gonna have plenty of time for that now, son. I'm putting you under arrest.

SAMUEL: For murder?

SHERIFF DANIELS: For suspicion of murder.

SAMUEL: Mind if I finish my beer first?

SHERIFF DANIELS: No, you go right on ahead. I'm gonna have someone take a statement from you. I'll see what I can do about getting your Caddy towed.

(Daniels starts away but Mulder calls after him.)

MULDER: Hey, Sheriff? What evidence do you have to charge the boy with murder?

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, what more do you want? The boy's practically giving himself up.

MULDER: Look at him, though. He's drunk.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Then I'll add 'drunk and disorderly.' Let's get this straight. It's not a question about the boy's guilt - just how he did it.

MULDER: Let me have a minute with him?

SHERIFF DANIELS: Suit yourself.

MULDER: Samuel, I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully - from the FBI. (they sit down with him) Looks like you took quite a beating there.

SAMUEL: Penance, Mr. Mulder.

SCULLY: Some might call it a plain old bar brawl.

SAMUEL: You know what they say - he giveth then he taketh away. A man gets too proud - sometimes it does him good to get the crap kicked out him. Saves God the trouble.

SCULLY: The trouble of what?

SAMUEL: Humbling the guilty sinner.

MULDER: Guilty of murder?

SAMUEL: Yes, sir.

MULDER: How'd you do it, Samuel?

SAMUEL: Apparently, my pride and weakness were an invitation to the Devil. I muddied the river of my own faith. Now my gift has been corrupted.

SCULLY: So you're saying that you killed those people with a touch?

SAMUEL: I've laid my hands on the ill. Given them health. I've healed the sick. I've even touched the dying and given them life. God has given me a special gift.

SCULLY: Did he buy you all that jewelry, too? I think there's something missing in your story, Samuel.

SAMUEL: (sharply) Do you doubt the power of God, ma'am?

SCULLY: No. But I doubt the veracity of your claims.

SAMUEL: I've looked on the infirm and seen their sickness ... their cancer. Just as I can see the pain on this man (points at Mulder) right here.

MULDER: Really? What pain is that?

SAMUEL: The pain you have regarding a brother or a sister. It's an old pain. It's never been healed.

SCULLY: Is this some kind of a trick?

SAMUEL: No trick, ma'am.

SCULLY: (standing up) I think we should get the sheriff ...

MULDER: (remaining seated) I want to hear more about this pain. Tell me.

SAMUEL: I can see it, plain as day. It was a sister. You lost her, a sister quite young. Someone took her away.

MULDER: What else do you see?

SAMUEL: Strangers. A bright light.

SCULLY: Sheriff?

SAMUEL: You should have come here earlier. Chance I could have healed your pain.

SHERIFF DANIELS: All right, let's get this over with.

MULDER: Hey, I need another minute with him.

SAMUEL: I can't help you. Not any more. My gift is gone.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Cuff him. (the deputy does) All right, let's go. You have the right to remain silent ...

(As the sheriff and deputy lead Samuel away, Mulder puts his hand to his eyes, affected by Samuel's words.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: You have the right to an attorney ...

SAMUEL: (turning back to Mulder) I'll tell you, Mr. Mulder. God watches over his flock. He gives us signs every day. Open your heart. He might just open your eyes.

(Samuel is led away. Mulder is still shaken.)

SCULLY: How do you think he does it?

MULDER: I don't know.




SCENE 6
KENWOOD COUNTY COURTHOUSE
(A preliminary hearing is being held for Samuel. Mulder and Scully are in the gallery.)

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Given his exemplary record, and the highly circumstatial nature of this case, I ask that my client be released on his own recognizance, without bail ...

SAMUEL: (stands up) Judge! That is not a good idea.

REVEREND HARTLEY: (from the gallery) Samuel!

SAMUEL: Let me go and it'll be on your head!

JUDGE: (banging gavel) Enough! This is not a pulpit. This is a court of law. Is that understood?

SAMUEL: Yes, sir. (he sits)

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Sorry.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Your honor. Despite the defendant's avowed guilt, we see no reason to burden the county with his maintenance until trial. But we do request a minimum bail of $100,000.

JUDGE: All right. If there are no objections, bail is set at $100,000, to be deposited directly into the clerk's probation account.

(As the judge speaks, locusts start flying around the courtroom. There are scattered screams from the gallery. The judge stands and waves at the locusts flying around him.)

JUDGE: My God! What the ... Good God! What is this? What?

(The bench and tables are covered with locusts.)

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Oh God!

SAMUEL: (standing and addressing the crowd) How much more will it take for you to believe? The Lord has testified against me. Does the serpent have to bite you all on the ass 'til you understand?

BALIFF: Everybody, clear this courtroom!

(Samuel raises his arms to heaven and clenches his fists as the rest hurry out of the courtroom. Reverend Hartley encounters Sheriff Daniels outside the courtroom and stops, as if to say something to him. From behind, Leonard Vance puts his hand on Hartley's shoulder. Hartley and Vance then leave.)




SCENE 7
MOTEL ROOM
(Mulder and Scully are in his motel room. Mulder reads from the Bible while Scully examines one of the locusts.)

MULDER: "And when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. And the locusts covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the ...

SCULLY: Why, Mulder?

MULDER: (lying down on the bed) ... land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left."

SCULLY: A few thousand grasshoppers does not constitute a plague. Besides which, we're in farm country. This area is an agricultural smorgasbord for this type of infestation.

MULDER: Yeah, maybe in a cornfield, but this happened in a courtroom.

SCULLY: So what's next? The slaying of the firstborn? (Mulder chuckles) Mulder, does this have something to do with what Samuel said in the bar last night - about your sister?

(Mulder closes the Bible and hands her a file that was lying on the bed. She looks through it.)

MULDER: I had these patient cases sent over from Kenwood County Hospital. These are physician-documented cases of patients who went to Samuel after conventional treatments failed.

SCULLY: "Spontaneous remission of metastatic cancer ... regenerated nerve growth after post-trauma paraplegia ..."

MULDER: I've encountered dozens of psychic healers in the X-Files, but none like this. I think the kid's for real.

SCULLY: Mulder, I admit this is intriguing, but there's a whole library of medical literature dealing with unexplained spontaneous cures.

MULDER: Well, western medicine treats the human body in biochemical terms, right?

SCULLY: Um-hmm.

MULDER: But the body can also be treated as an electromagnetic system.

SCULLY: So your theory is that if Samuel can repair this energy field in order to heal, he can also destroy it in order to kill.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: OK, say that Samuel's touch can kill. Why would he want to?

MULDER: Well, you heard him, Scully. He muddied the river of his own faith. That means he's ...

(There's a knock on the door. Mulder answers. It is Leonard Vance.)

VANCE: If you're available, the Reverend would like to see you.




SCENE 8
REVEREND HARTLEY RESIDENCE
(Mulder and Scully visit Hartley in his home. He sits behind a large desk, his back to the window.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: I've been under a great deal of stress lately ... which I know doesn't excuse my rude behavior yesterday, but I hope, somehow, you found it in your hearts to forgive me.

MULDER: Why did you want to speak with us?

REVEREND HARTLEY: I need your help.

MULDER: Samuel's being tried for murder. I think what you need is a good lawyer.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Samuel is innocent.

MULDER: Well, how can you be sure of that?

REVEREND HARTLEY: Because he's my son.

MULDER: Somehow, I don't think that argument will work on a jury. And Samuel's confession won't help much, either.

REVEREND HARTLEY: You have to understand. Samuel is a very complicated young man. He feels things like no one else. To him, a pinprick becomes a gaping wound. His power comes from this ability to feel. But you see, some people fear that power. And out of their weakness and their fear, they seek to destroy it.

SCULLY: You mean Sheriff Daniels?

REVEREND HARTLEY: I mean, it's no secret Sheriff Daniels has been trying to shut me down since I first opened my tent ten years ago.

SCULLY: Well, he seems to think that your ministry is a fraud.

REVEREND HARTLEY: He's a faithless man, Agent Scully. His wife - she suffers from a most painful arthritis, her fingers twisted like bitter roots. Yet he keeps Samuel from ministering to her.

SCULLY: In light of recent events, you can't blame him.

REVEREND HARTLEY: I don't know how those poor people died. I can't explain that. Which is why I'm asking you to be there tonight so you could see for yourselves, Samuel doing God's work. Can I count on you both to be there?

(Mulder looks past Hartley and sees a young girl with long brown hair, wearing a red dress, in the yard.)

SCULLY: I think so. Mulder, what do you think?

MULDER: Excuse me.

(He leaves abruptly, to the surprise of Scully and Hartley. Mulder runs out the front door and looks around but sees no sign of the little girl. There is a man waxing one of the cars in the driveway.)

MULDER: (to Man) Hey, where'd she go?

MAN: Who?

MULDER: A little girl.

MAN: There's no little girl around here.

(Mulder looks upstairs and sees Samuel standing in the window. Scully comes out of the front door.)

SCULLY: Mulder. What is it?

MULDER: It's a girl.

SCULLY: Who? Jessica Hahn?

MULDER: A little girl.

(He looks back at the upstairs window but Samuel is no longer there.)




SCENE 9
MIRACLE MINISTRY TENT
(That evening, guests are entering the Miracle Ministry's tent, passing a table with refreshments. Leonard Vance is greeting them.)

VANCE: Well, brothers and sisters, help yourselves. Now, let folks with the wheelchairs though, now, that's right, don't be shy.

(Margaret Hohman, a young woman in a wheelchair, enters followed by her parents)

VANCE: Hello there, welcome to the Miracle Ministry. Y'all come to see Samuel tonight?

MARGARET'S MOTHER: Yes. Is he going to be here? The papers said ...

VANCE: Oh, and don't mind what you read in the papers. God's work will be done. (hands Margaret a cup) Young Samuel's here to cast out the Devil and heal the sick.

MARGARET'S FATHER: Did you hear that, honey?

MARGARET HOHMAN: Will he be able to see me?

VANCE: Well, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna put in a special word, hmm. What's your name, darling?

MARGARET HOHMAN: Margaret Hohman.

VANCE: Margaret? Well, Margaret, you wait right here. I'm gonna see if I can't get somebody to put you in the front row. How'd that be, huh?

(Margaret's mother hugs her as she takes a sip from the cup.)

(Backstage, Samuel sits at a dressing table. Hartley is behind him.)

SAMUEL: I can't go out there ... not after what's happened.

REVEREND HARTLEY: God tests the faith in us all, son. And because He's chosen you to act in His likeness, He's given you the toughest test of all. (Vance enters) Do not forsake your gifts, Samuel.

SAMUEL: Aw, man ...

(Hartley lifts Samuel by the shoulders and turns him around.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: I'm a preacher, son. That's my gift. But all the preaching in the world could not equal even a small miracle in consolidating the faith and hope of these people. Let this man - (puts a hand on Vance's shoulder) - whose life you saved, give witness tonight to the grace and goodness of your healing power.

VANCE: They're all waiting on you, Samuel.

(In the tent, the choir is singing "Ready, you got to be ready" over and over while the crowd claps and sings along. Mulder and Scully enter and find a seat.)

ANNOUNCER: Reverend Calvin Hartley.

(Hartley enters and waves to applause.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Yes, indeedy, praise God. Hallelujah!

ALL: Hallelujah!

REVEREND HARTLEY: Praise the Lord!

ALL: Praise the Lord!

REVEREND HARTLEY: God is here tonight. Oh, yes!

(An assistant hands Mulder the collection plate.)

ASSISTANT: Pass it down please.

REVEREND HARTLEY: I feel his presence. Oh, amen.

(Mulder hands the plate to Scully, who notes the money in it. She passes it down.)

SCULLY: Apparently miracles don't come cheap.

REVEREND HARTLEY: God is here, and He is here to heal!

(The crowd cheers.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Yes, heal. Hallelujah. There's a man I'd like to introduce to you - a man who has seen the face of God but who was not satisfied to go to that great place, oh no. No, God had work for him to do right here on earth ... as it is in heaven, mm-hmm. (crowd cheers) I saw this man come back from beyond death's door. (points to Vance) He stands here today as a living testament to the ability of God to work miracles. Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, our beloved friend, Leonard Vance.

(He hands the microphone to Vance.)

VANCE: As it says in John, chapter 3, "no man can do these miracles unless God be with him." That man, to whom I owe my life, is Samuel Hartley, and he is here tonight to heal you.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Thank you, Leonard. Ladies and gentlemen, God's soldier ... Samuel Hartley.

(As Samuel comes out to cheers and singing, Mulder looks over and sees the little girl at the side of the tent. He rises and walks in that direction.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Samuel walks over to those on the front row.)

SAMUEL: (touching a woman's cheek) Receive God's love. (taking a young man's head in his hands) You have the power of God.

(Mulder is moving through the crowd but no longer sees the little girl. Samuel kneels in front of Margaret's wheelchair.)

SAMUEL: Pray with me.

(He touches her cheek. Margaret's parents, each with a hand on her shoulder, pray as well.)

(Mulder continues to move through the crowd but doesn't see the little girl.)

SAMUEL: Close your eyes.

(He continues to touch her cheek. Margaret gasps, then starts to heave loudly. Shocked, Samuel rises and backs away as Margaret's parents try to help her.)

MARGARET'S FATHER: What have you done, boy?

REVEREND HARTLEY: All right, everyone, remain calm. Let's give the young woman some room here.

(Scully is pushing her way through the crowd toward Margaret.)

SCULLY: I'm a doctor.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Everybody, praise God. Say hallelujah!

(Scully reaches Margaret and kneels in front of her. Margaret is having convulsions.)

SCULLY: Somebody get an ambulance!

REVEREND HARTLEY: All right now, don't panic. Just praise the Lord!

(Sheriff Daniels and Mulder approach the front as well. Margaret falls silent and Scully checks her pulse and then stands.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder) She's dead.

(Margaret's mother sobs loudly and hugs her daughter. Hartley hustles Samuel, who is also in tears, off the stage.)




SCENE 10
KENWOOD COUNTY HOSPITAL
(Outside, Vance speaks with a group of mourners carrying candles.)

VANCE: ... a loving friend. Children of God. Brothers and sisters. If you desecrate the body, then you slay the soul. Let's keep this poor woman's body intact.

(Inside, Scully talks to Margaret's father in a hallway, as Mulder leans on the wall nearby.)

SCULLY: We know the Reverend Hartley's been pressuring you, but this is the third death linked with the Miracle Ministry.

MARGARET'S FATHER: Reverend Hartley says an autopsy is against scripture.

SCULLY: What illness did your daughter suffer from, Mr. Hohman?

MARGARET'S FATHER: She had M.S.

SCULLY: And has she ever had a siezure before this?

MARGARET'S FATHER: Not to my knowledge.

SCULLY: You see, I think that the siezure she had is indicative of some kind of embolism or aneurysm.

MARGARET'S FATHER: But the boy only touched her forehead.

SCULLY: And are you going to be content to bury her without knowing the true cause of death? Without knowing if there was foul play involved?

MARGARET'S FATHER: Give me a moment.

(He steps over and kneels beside his wife, who is sitting in a chair and crying. Mulder and Scully move farther down the hall and talk quietly.)

MULDER: Do you think the boy really did it?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: I was raised a Catholic, and I have a certain familiarity with the scripture. And God never lets the Devil steal the show.

MULDER: (smiling) You must have really liked 'The Exorcist'?

SCULLY: (nodding and smiling) One of my favorite movies.

(Mulder leans against the wall again, looking drained.)

SCULLY: So who were you pursuing in the crowd tonight?

MULDER: I thought I saw someone I knew.

SCULLY: That boy really has you going, doesn't he?

MULDER: Why do you say that?

SCULLY: In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister. Is it your sister you keep thinking you're seeing?

MULDER: I've seen her twice now.

SCULLY: Maybe you just want to see her.

MULDER: Oh ... I'm not delusional, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, don't discount the power of suggestion. A healer's greatest magic lies in the patient's willingness to believe. Imagine a miracle and you're halfway there. We learned that in med school.

MULDER: You think this is what Margaret Hohman and her parents were imagining?

(They start back up the hall. Margaret's father approaches.)

MARGARET'S FATHER: (nodding) We're gonna go along with your investigation.




SCENE 11
MORGUE
(Scully is in full surgical gear, preparing to conduct the autopsy. She sharpens a large knife.)

SCULLY: (Into microphone) 11:21 pm, March 7. Subject's name is Margaret Hohman, female, caucasian, 107 pounds.

(Mulder turns his head as she begins.)

(Time passes. It is now 12:29 am.)

SCULLY: Mulder, take a look at this.

MULDER: Do I have to?

SCULLY: (with a lung in her hands) Lesions on the lungs here. I'm finding them throughout the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. There's also a lot of damage to the mucous membranes. I think that she must have died from cellular hypoxia - a lack of oxygen to the cells.

MULDER: What would cause that?

SCULLY: My guess? Ingestion or injection of sodium or potassium cyanide, maybe arsenic. I won't know exactly until I run a toxicology screen on her.

MULDER: How soon?

SCULLY: Labs won't be open 'til morning.

MULDER: See who you can push to have it done, as soon as possible. (He leaves)




SCENE 12
KENWOOD COUNTY JAIL
(Samuel is lying on the cot in his cell. Mulder approaches with a deputy.)

MULDER: Samuel? It's Agent Mulder.

SAMUEL: Yeah. What do you want?

MULDER: I want to talk with you. If you'd prefer your attorney were present ...

SAMUEL: Whatever. No.

(The deputy opens the door and Mulder enters.)

MULDER: I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels. He's on his way down here. I'm gonna ask him to release you.

(The jailer closes the door. Samuel gets up.)

SAMUEL: Why are you doing this? You were there, man. You saw for yourself.

MULDER: Did you poison Margaret Hohman?

SAMUEL: Did I poison her?

MULDER: Did you poison her using potassium or sodium cyanide, because that's what killed her.

SAMUEL: What are you talking about? (he sits on the cot)

MULDER: You're innocent, Samuel - unless you had a hand in administering it, and I don't think you did.

SAMUEL: Whatever the cause, Mr. Mulder, I am responsible. (he lies back on the cot)

MULDER: Well, the evidence will be presented at your arraignment tomorrow. The habeas corpus law will force them to release you, so you might as well go home and get some rest anyway.

SAMUEL: Just leave me alone, OK?

MULDER: Look, Samuel, if you think that the punishment for your sins is the deaths of those people ...

SAMUEL: The Lord has testified against me, Mr. Mulder!

MULDER: I can't stand here and argue with your Biblical rhetoric, but I do know that the law will find you innocent!

(Samuel says nothing but looks down. Mulder kneels in front of him.)

MULDER: You said you could see my pain. Look at me. (Samuel does) What do you see now?

SAMUEL: I see nothing. I am blind.

MULDER: I don't believe you. I've seen her. It was her, wasn't it?

SAMUEL: Your sister?

MULDER: You made her appear to me, didn't you? Look at me.

SAMUEL: (sharply) I am very tired, Mr. Mulder.

MULDER: (loudly) Is she alive? Is that what I'm supposed to believe, or is this a trick?

SAMUEL: You mean ... a trick of the Devil?

MULDER: (sighs in exasperation) Jailer!

(Mulder, annoyed, strides out of the cell block, encountering Sheriff Daniels and another deputy.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: I see I'm a little late for this ball.

MULDER: I called you down here to ask you to release the boy.

SHERIFF DANIELS: On what pretense?

MULDER: His innocence.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Aren't you a little out of your depth, Agent Mulder? This may be Hicksville to you, but we do try and hew to the legal system.

MULDER: I don't want to pick a fight. He seems determined to stay here anyway.

SHERIFF DANIELS: What does that tell you?

MULDER: It tells me that you're determined to have him charged, while your real homicide suspect is still at large. (he leaves)

(Later, the deputy, the same one that was standing with Daniels, brings two men into the cell block and opens the door to Samuel's cell.)

DEPUTY: I got some company for you, Sam.

(The men enter and the deputy closes the door and walks away. The men slam Samuel against the door. Down the corridor, a prisoner stares at the deputy as he walks by.)

DEPUTY: (to prisoner) What are you looking at?

(Back in Samuel's cell, the two men punch him repeatedly.)




SCENE 13
(The next morning, Deputy Tyson rings the bell at Sheriff Daniel's house. His wife starts for the door in her motorized wheelchair as the Sheriff comes down the stairs.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: I'll get it. I'll get it.

(They go together to the door. The sheriff opens it.)

DEPUTY TYSON: Ma'am. Sheriff.

LILLIAN DANIELS: Hey, Dennis. How are you?

DEPUTY TYSON: Just fine, ma'am, just fine. (to Sheriff) Except we had an incident down at the jail.

SHERIFF DANIELS: What incident would that be, Tyson?

DEPUTY TYSON: The preacher boy - he's dead.




SCENE 14
KENWOOD COUNTY JAIL
(Outside, Samuel's body is being taken away as a small crowd watches. Scully and Mulder are with the Sheriff.)

SCULLY: He was alone in his cell when Mulder left him this morning. How could this have happened?

SHERIFF DANIELS: The boy started a fight with a couple of rowdies we picked up on a DUI. He took some pretty mean blows to the head. He died before the ambulance got here.

(Hartley and Vance arrive in a car. Daniels starts to walk away.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: (to Sheriff) His blood is spilled! And it's all over you! (points at him)

VANCE: Reverend ...

(The sheriff stops and Hartley approaches him.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: How much longer are you gonna hide behind that badge (pokes at the badge) before the truth is revealed.

SHERIFF DANIELS: I have work to do.

(He walks away. Hartley starts to follow, but Vance grabs him by the arm. Scully approaches them.)

SCULLY: Reverend Hartley. We're sorry for your loss.

REVEREND HARTLEY: (near tears) That boy ... he was blessed. He never hurt a soul.

VANCE: Come on now, Reverend. Our friends will be finding out about Samuel sooner than later, and well, it's probably best if they hear it from you. Come on. (to Scully) Ma'am.

(They leave. Scully steps back to Mulder, who has been standing alone gazing into space.)

SCULLY: You've got that look on your face, Mulder.

MULDER: What look is that?

SCULLY: The kind when you've forgotten your keys and you're trying to figure out how to get back in the house.

(He gives her a tight-lipped grin.)




SCENE 15
COURTROOM
(Later, they are in the empty courtroom. Mulder looks around the judge's bench.)

SCULLY: What exactly are we trying to find?

MULDER: Clues.

SCULLY: Oh.

(Mulder walks over and steps on a dead locust. He picks it up and examines it.)

SCULLY: What does it mean?

(They look up and see a couple more dead locusts in the vent overhead.)

MULDER: Let's find out.

(On the roof, Mulder finds a small morsel near the ventilation intake. He calls Scully over.)

MULDER: Scully. (showing it to her) It's potato. (looking into the intake) Someone left a trail of food in the ventilation system, leading to the courtroom. You dump your locusts in here ... instant plague.

SCULLY: Well, where did they all come from?

MULDER: Biological supply houses usually hatch them on order to farms and universities. It shouldn't be too hard to find out who set this up.

SCULLY: And you think whoever did this is responsible for the murders.

(Mulder nods.)




SCENE 16
HARTLEY RESIDENCE
(That night, a thunderstorm rages outside. Vance tosses and turns in an upstairs bedroom at Hartley's mansion. There is a crash of thunder and Vance sees Samuel standing in front of the bed. There is an aura around Samuel's body. Vance gasps and climbs out of bed.)

VANCE: You're dead. They killed you.

SAMUEL: I was dead. But here I am.

VANCE: No!

SAMUEL: Why did you betray me?

(Vance swings his cane at Samuel but hits nothing. Now Samuel is behind him.)

SAMUEL: You murdered those people. (Vance turns and gasps again) They came to me to be healed, and you murdered them. Why? After I gave you back your life?

VANCE: (holding out his damaged hands) You call this life?

(Later, Hartley answers a knock on the door. It's Sheriff Daniels with Mulder and Scully.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: (to Sheriff) What in tarnation do you want?

SHERIFF DANIELS: We have a warrant for the arrest of Leonard Vance. Where is he?

REVEREND HARTLEY: You must be mistaken.

SCULLY: I'm afraid not, Reverend. We've traced a pesticide order to him from a chemical company in Knoxville. Cyanogen bromide - it's a cyanide derivative.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Leonard poisoned those people?

(As they enter his bedroom, Vance lies on his bed, whimpering.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Get your clothes on, Vance. You're under arrest.

VANCE: (gasping) I betrayed him.

(Scully sniffs the contents of a glass by his bedside.)

SCULLY: Cyanide - there's no way to tell how much he's ingested.

MULDER: I'll call an ambulance.

SCULLY: It's too late, we have to get him to the hospital ourselves.

VANCE: (breathlessly) I thought, "why didn't he let me die?" Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves. That's what I thought he was, because who else would bring me back ... looking like this. He was here.

MULDER: Who?

VANCE: Samuel.

SHERIFF DANIELS: The man's delirious.

VANCE: He was here, Reverend. Right in this room. And he forgave me.

(Vance gasps again and dies.)




SCENE 17
SCULLY'S ROOM
(Later that night, Scully types on her laptop computer.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) Rather than simply killing Samuel, Vance contrived to kill the ministry's faith in him. We have conclusive evidence connecting him both to the courtroom infestation and to the poisoning deaths of three members of the ministry. Vance's obsession outlived Samuel, however. His conscience haunted him until he became delusory and finally took his own life, effectively ending our investigation. In light of this information, it is highly doubtful that there have ever been any miracles in Kenwood, Tennessee.

(Mulder is in his room, packing his things, including a framed photograph of young Samantha. His phone rings.)

MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.

(As Scully closes her computer, there's a knock on her door.)

MULDER: (from outside the door) Scully. (she opens it) Sheriff Daniels just called. Samuel's body is missing from the morgue.




SCENE 18
MORGUE
(At the morgue, Mulder pulls out the empty tray where Samuel's body was being kept. He is with Scully, Sheriff Daniels and Deputy Tyson.)

MULDER: Any witnesses?

DEPUTY TYSON: One, so far. The night nurse who made the report - Beatrice Salinger.

MULDER: She saw somebody take the body?

DEPUTY TYSON: Not actually.

MULDER: What do you mean, not actually?

SHERIFF DANIELS: Talk sense, deputy.

DEPUTY TYSON: She didn't exactly see anyone taking the body.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, what then?

DEPUTY TYSON: She, uh, she claims she saw Samuel walking out by himself. Sounds crazy, I know, but that's what she told me.

MULDER: (heading out of the morgue) You coming, Sheriff?

(Mulder, Scully and the sheriff are now talking to Beatrice Salinger.)

BEATRICE SALINGER: I was drinking my coffee and going over the night orders for my ward, 7 South, when he walked right by me. His face was all black and blue.

MULDER: And you're sure it was him?

BEATRICE SALINGER: Well, at first I thought my eyes were playing tricks, which happens a lot on graveyard. So I got up to look again, but I lost him around the corner. He just vanished. Then I went to check the morgue, and his body was gone.

SHERIFF DANIELS: I don't believe this. This is insane. I'm not gonna listen to any more of this woman's crazy talk. (he starts to leave)

BEATRICE SALINGER: I'm not the only one who saw him, Sheriff, so I know I'm not crazy. Other people saw him, too. (the sheriff leaves) (to Mulder and Scully) I'm not crazy. It was Samuel.




SCENE 19
SHERIFF DANIELS' RESIDENCE
(Daniels returns home the next morning. He pauses on a wooden bridge over a culvert in his front yard and sits on the railing, thinking.)

(Later, his wife reads the morning paper, which has a large headline that reads "MURDERED FAITH HEALER RISES FROM DEAD / NURSE CLAIMS TO BE WITNESS." The sheriff sits quietly near her.)

LILLIAN DANIELS: This isn't true, Maurice? Is it? The boy was an awful fake, just like you said, wasn't he Maurice? (emotionally) Wasn't he, Maurice?

(He looks at her but doesn't answer. She starts to cry. There's a knock on the door. The sheriff opens to door to the flashing lights of Deputy Tyson's car beacons.)

DEPUTY TYSON: Sir ... gonna have to ask you to come with me. District Attorney wants to ask you some questions concerning the boy's death.




SCENE 20
OUTSIDE MINISTRY TENT
(Later, Scully and Mulder are in front of the ministry's tent as workers carry a large sign by that reads "Miracle Ministry - Samuel Saves." They are also discarding "Samuel Heals" posters.)

SCULLY: Sundays will probably never be the same again in these parts.

MULDER: I have a strong sense the Reverend Hartley's not going to be able to give up the pulpit.

SCULLY: Even without his son?

MULDER: It might even strengthen his faith. Remember, the boy did rise from the dead. That kind of thing happens only once or twice every two thousand years or so.

SCULLY: Yeah, and I have a story about a plague of locusts. I just hope Reverend Hartley didn't arrange this body snatching as his miracle of miracles.

MULDER: Somehow, I don't think so.

SCULLY: What exactly do you think?

MULDER: I think people are looking hard for miracles ... so hard that maybe they make themselves see what they want to see.

(He steps to the car and unlocks the door. In the door window, he sees the reflection of the little girl again. He whirls but doesn't see her. As he stares at the area, Scully gets into the passenger's seat.)

SCULLY: You coming, Mulder?

(He gets in and they drive away, passing a trash can with several "Samuel Heals" posters.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
TWO MEDICINE RANCH,
BROWNING, MONTANA
(It is a dark and stormy night. Inside their home, Jim and Lyle Parker load their shotguns. The sound of an animal roaring can be heard. The Parkers step outside and walk toward their barn. Lyle, the son, enters a stall in the barn to check on a horse. He then steps out of the barn and finds a bull lying dead. He hears a growl nearby and looks around. With his gun raised, he enters the barn again. A hideous face is seen watching him, and then Lyle is attacked from behind by a large animal and falls on the barn floor. Jim Parker hears the roar. The animal, which looks like a man-beast of some sort, swipes at Lyle, then throws him outside the barn and through a fence. Jim Parker fires his shotgun, and the beast is hit in the back and falls. Jim runs to assist Lyle, who is still lying on the ground. He looks over at the beast, but instead sees a dead man lying on his back, blood flowing from his chest.)




SCENE 2
(Mulder and Scully are talking with Jim and Lyle Parker in their ranchhouse. There are numerous mounted animal heads on the walls. The Parker's attorney, David Gates, is also in the room.)

JIM PARKER: I'm not a killer ... and I never meant to hurt no one. But I'm tired of my cattle being butchered a hundred miles from the slaughterhouse. That's the fourth one this month alone.

MULDER: Then who or what do you think was responsible?

JIM PARKER: Look, mister. That cow looked like a piece of paper that had gone through a shredder. I don't know of no animal that could have done that.

MULDER: Then are you saying that a person or persons was responsible for this?

DAVID GATES: I want to remind you that Mr. Parker is free on bond pending trial. He's willfully speaking with you solely in regards to this incident and not about any other pending litigation.

SCULLY: So we can't talk about Mr. Parkers federal court case against the Trego indian reservation?

DAVID GATES: That's exactly what I mean.

JIM PARKER: Now wait just a damned second ...

DAVID GATES: Jim, don't say a word.

JIM PARKER: (angrily) No, this ain't the time for that lawyer crap. I want to get this out in the open. You people think I went and killed me an Indian just because we're having an argument about where my land ends and their land begins.

LYLE PARKER: We want to settle that peacefully, in court.

SCULLY: Well, Joseph Goodensnake is dead with a wound from your shotgun to indicate otherwise.

JIM PARKER: All I'm saying, it was no kind of animal that I know of. But it damn well didn't seem human neither, that night. Take a look at my boy's scars. (Mulder walks over to look at Lyle) It was dark, we heard a growl and we went out there to protect the cattle. I could have swore I saw ... red eyes and fangs. I thought my boy Lyle was ... look, nobody - nobody - was more shocked and upset than I was to find out it was that young Indian boy, but if he was the one that was killing our cattle, I'm very, very sorry that we had to find out about it that way, but as far as I'm concerned, that's the end of it.

MULDER: Can we see the corral?

LYLE PARKER: I'll take you out there.

(Lyle takes Scully and Mulder outside, closing a sliding door behind them. They stop to talk on the porch.)

LYLE PARKER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

LYLE PARKER: Agent Scully? I suppose if I were hearing our side of the story, it might not hold up too well. Parts I don't understand myself - things my father could never try to explain to a stranger.

MULDER: What kinds of things?

LYLE PARKER: For the last few months, whenever we'd go outside at night and check on the cattle - never saw anything out of the ordinary. Not a mountain lion, not a coyote, not even any Tregos, Agent Scully. But I could feel it. Something not human ... out there ... watching me. The air was more still, the night animals more quiet. It was like nature herself was terrified. It gave me the creeps.

SCULLY: The creeps?

LYLE PARKER: Yeah, the creeps. (to Scully) Don't you ever get the creeps?

(Mulder is staring at Scully as Lyle walks away. Scully sees Mulder, then self-consciously looks away from him and follows Lyle.)

(Mulder and Scully are inspecting the corral. They are carrying umbrellas, as a light rain is falling.)

SCULLY: The victim was shot there, about three meters from where Parker fired. There's no way he could have mistaken a person for an animal. It's open-and-shut, Mulder. You know, I'm surprised you volunteered for this assignment. Any Bureau agent could have investigated this reservation homicide. Why are you interested?

(Mulder has found an unusual set of tracks in the mud. The tracks look like boot footprints at first, but change to a barefoot animal track.)

(Later, they are preparing to leave the ranch. Scully walks out of the barn to join Mulder.)

SCULLY: Well, there seems to be nothing unexplainable about this case.

MULDER: Nope. Not a thing.

(He holds up a large, thin piece of skinlike material.)

(Scully is examining the skinlike material as they drive away.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this is so odd. It's almost like a snakeskin that's been shed. I suspect that the Parkers knowingly killed Joe Goodensnake, but they hardly seem the type to skin their victim.

MULDER: Besides which, police and coroner's report make no mention of such an act.

SCULLY: Well, we're going to have to take a look at the body ourselves.

MULDER: The body's been transferred to the reservation authorities. We're supposed to get in touch with, uh, um, Sheriff Charlie Tskany.




SCENE 3
TREGO INDIAN RESERVATION, NORTHWEST MONTANA
(They pull into the main area of the reservation, which is an area made muddy by the rains. They enter a small diner and approach the man behind the counter.)

MULDER: Excuse me, uh, we're not from around here. We're looking for Sheriff Tskany.

(The man behind the counter walks away without answering. A young woman playing pool notices Mulder and Scully. Mulder turns from the counter and addresses the diner patrons.)

MULDER: Anyone, uh, know Charlie Tskany?

ISH: Go home, FBI.

(They've been answered by Ish, an old man sitting in the shadows behind a pool table at the back of the diner. They walk toward him.)

MULDER: How'd you know?

ISH: I could smell you a mile away.

MULDER: Well, they told me that even though my deodorant's made for a woman, it's strong enough for a man.

(The old man does not smile.)

ISH: I was at Wounded Knee in 1973. What I learned fighting the FBI is you don't believe in us and we don't believe in you.

MULDER: I want to believe.

ISH: Why you here? What are you looking for?

MULDER: I think you already know what we're looking for.

ISH: You tell me what I know.

SCULLY: We're looking for any individuals who might be able to provide information on the homicide of Joe Goodensnake ...

MULDER: (interrupting her) We're looking for anything that can create human tracks in one step and animal tracks in the next.

ISH: Parker. He found what you're looking for. He killed what you're looking for, FBI.

(The young woman, Gwen Goodensnake, slams a pool cue down on the table.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: What Parker and his kid killed was my brother ... and you're all too afraid of some stupid Indian legend to do anything. I hate it.

ISH: Gwen!

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: And I hate suits who are always here when they need something from us, but when we need help, they're nowhere to be found.

(She walks out of the diner, passing a man wearing a sheriff's badge. Scully walks over to meet him.)

SCULLY: Sheriff Tskany? (she extends her hand but the sheriff does not extend his) I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Goodensnake's body is in my office.

(They follow him out of the diner. Outside, they approach the sheriff's office. There are two Trego men standing in front of the door.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: (to the men) Bill, Tom. Let 'em through. Come on, boys, let 'em through.

(They stand aside and let them through into the office.)

MULDER: Who were they?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Guardians of the dead. They escort the deceased's spirits to the new world. I only let them as far as the front door. Anybody that knows me knows that I keep the ancient beliefs out there and the police work in here.

MULDER: The woman in the pool hall said that people were afraid of some Indian legend. What do they believe happened in the Parker case?

SHERIFF TSKANY: (annoyed) Look, I'm not a park ranger here to answer all your questions about Indians. Whenever I need federal help, I never get it. Since this case falls under the jurisdiction of the FBI, you're entitled to examine the body. So let's get it over with.

(They walk into a back room where the body is kept.)

MULDER: Was the woman in the pool hall his sister?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Gwen. She and Joe are primarily responsible for fueling the boundary dispute with Parker. They felt that he had been grazing his cattle farther and farther onto the reservation. Parker probably told you it was his idea to settle in court. Joe and Gwen filed the suit.

(Mulder has pulled the sheet from the man's body, and he and Scully see four partially-healed scars, as if from an animal, on his upper chest.)

SCULLY: Take a look at that scar tissue.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Looks like he'd been attacked by an animal as well.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Could Joe have been attacked also? Maybe the Parkers did see an animal.

SCULLY: No. Those wounds have been healing for quite some time. The shotgun wound indicates point-blank range. The pellets entered the body in a single mass. The assailant couldn't have been more than three feet away.

(Mulder is examining the dead man's mouth and teeth.)

MULDER: We're gonna need to take a look at Joe Goodensnake's dental records.

(Scully comes closer to look as Mulder holds his mouth open. Two of his upper teeth are sharp, pointed fangs.)




SCENE 4
(Mulder and Scully are looking over dental X-rays.)

MULDER: See, these are the canine cuspids. They're normal.

SCULLY: Well, could his records have been switched or misplaced?

MULDER: No, you see the second incisor here is chipped just like the ones in his mouth. These match Joe Goodensnakes'.

SCULLY: Well, there are cases of calcium phosphate salts developing abnormally with age, but ...

(Mulder shakes his head, mildly annoyed with Scully's attempt at an explanation.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: That could account for what Jim Parker claims to have seen. He was out that night, expecting to see a mountain lion killing his cattle. He gets rattled and the flashlight beam catches Joe, here.

SCULLY: So Parker saw what he wanted to see, an animal.

MULDER: Lyle Parker was attacked, he has scars just like Joe. Do you have a facility where we can perform an autopsy?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Why?

MULDER: Well, if Joe's teeth are abnormal, an autopsy might reveal abnormalities in the interior of his anatomy as well.

SHERIFF TSKANY: I can't allow that.

(Tskany walks back to the front office and sits at his desk. Scully and Mulder follow him.)

SCULLY: I'm fully qualified.

SHERIFF TSKANY: No. I can't let you do an autopsy. The funeral is tonight.

MULDER: It's a cremation. After that, we'll have nothing.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Tregoes believe that the recent dead are unsettled by their new condition as spirits. Any desecration of the body angers the spirit and keeps it haunting this world.

SCULLY: But you're a law enforcement officer. You can't destroy evidence.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Don't tell me what I can't do. Native Americans believe that their law is greater and more just than that of the U.S. government. If they want Joe at rest rather than used as a piece of evidence, that's the way it's gonna be. If you want to make an issue out of it - your higher authority - go right ahead.

(He walks away from them.)

MULDER: Charlie? Do you believe that the spirit of Joe Goodensnake is in that room?

SHERIFF TSKANY: (turning back to him) All I know is - tomorrow, day after - you're gonna leave. But I have to stay here. I've gotta answer to these people. You can continue your investigation, but you're gonna have to do it without Joe Goodensnake's body.

(Mulder hands him the dental records, and he and Scully leave.)

(It is late afternoon, and the dead man's body is lying on a cremation platform. The two Trego guardians are in front of the platform, while a third, in ceremonial attire, chants and performs a ritualistic dance. Mulder and Scully are sitting in their car a short distance away.)

SCULLY: Mulder, since we've been here, you've acted as if you've expected to find every piece of evidence that we've come across. What aren't you telling me? Why are we here?

MULDER: A true piece of history, Scully. (he reaches behind the seat to get a file) The very first X-file, initiated by J. Edgar Hoover himself in 1946. (he hands it to Scully) During World War II, a series of murders occurred in and around the northwest, seven here in Browning alone. Each victim was basically ripped to shreds and eaten, as if by a wild animal. However, many of the victims were found at home, as if they allowed their killer to enter. In 1946, police cornered what they believed to be such an animal in a cabin in Glacier National Park. They shot it, but when they went in to retrieve the carcass, they found only the body of Richard Watkins.

SCULLY: Sounds like the Parker scenario.

MULDER: The murders stopped that year. Because the cases were unsolved and considered so bizarre, Hoover locked them away, hoping that in time people around here would forget about them.

SCULLY: This file indicates that they started again in 1954.

MULDER: In '59, '64, '78 and now again in '94. But ... (he reaches back for something else from the back seat)

SCULLY: Here it comes.

MULDER: ... these animal-man related murders predate the oldest X-file by 150 years. Members of the Lewis and Clark expedition wrote of Indian men who could change their shape into that of a wolf.

(He is looking at a drawing showing a large, wolf-like creature with a man between his jaws.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what this, what this folder describes is called lycanthropy. (Mulder bites his lip and looks away) It's a type of insanity in which an individual believes that he can turn into a wolf. I mean, no one can physically change into an animal.

(She gets out of the car. Mulder gets out as well and follows her.)

MULDER: How can you just dismiss the evidence - the tracks in the mud, the shredded skin, a man with the teeth of an animal?

SCULLY: Mulder, even if you're right and Joe Goodensnake did somehow have the ability to transform physically into an animal, he's dead. Jim Parker shot him and in a couple of moments, his body will be burned. End of mystery.

MULDER: Let's hope so.

(Scully walks closer to observe the ceremony. Gwen Goodensnake stands near the platform. Mulder remains farther back. He and Ish nod to each other. Scully approaches Gwen.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: (to Scully, but not looking at her) You don't belong here.

SCULLY: Gwen ...

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: You're only around to wrap up your investigation.

SCULLY: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about your brother. I feel sad for anyone who loses a part of their family.

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: A part? He was my whole family. I'm it now. As a demonstration of sorrow ... I'm supposed to give away all my brother's possessions.

(She hands Scully what appears to be a bracelet with several large animal claws.)

SCULLY: Gwen, I don't know what to say. I'm ...

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: It's no big deal. He had more possessions than he had friends.

(She walks away, and Scully looks at the claws. Sheriff Tskany pulls up in his vehicle and approaches. Mulder steps over toward him.)

MULDER: I read the report of your investigation into the Goodensnake homicide. It was very good, thorough, professional. But what I want to know is off the record. What do you think really happened?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Your explanation, Agent Mulder, is lying on that burial platform. Why don't you just accept that and go home?

MULDER: Charlie, do you believe in shape-shifting?

SHERIFF TSKANY: This is a funeral.

(It is now dark, and drums are beating as the funeral pyre is lit. A Trego begins a chant and is then joined by other members of the tribe. Lyle Parker rides up on his horse. He removes his hat. Gwen Goodensnake hears his horse and runs back toward him. Tskany, Mulder and Scully follow her.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: Get out of here!

LYLE PARKER: Please, I just want to show my respects.

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: I don't want your respects. I want your heart to grow cold. I want you to feel what I'm feeling.

(She spits on the ground.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: I think you better leave, Mr. Parker.

LYLE PARKER: (putting his hat back on) I wish your brother could be here. I wish that more than anything else.

(He rides off, and Gwen angrily walks back to the funeral platform, which burns brightly in the night.)

(Charlie Parker is sitting alone on the porch of his ranchhouse. He lights a cigar and then hears a faint growl. He sets down his drink and quietly walks down from the porch, looking around. The wind causes a set of riding gear to jingle nearby, and Charlie assumes that it was the wind that he heard. As he walks back to the porch, the hideous face appears and Charlie is attacked from behind. He falls onto the porch, then is picked up and shaken by the beast, then thrown across the porch. The beast then slashes at him wildly.)




SCENE 5
(The next day, the authorities are at the ranchhouse investigating Charlie Parker's death. Scully lifts the plastic covering over the body, then approaches Tskany.)

SCULLY: By the way the body's been mutilated, I'd say he's been attacked by a large predator, or someone wanted it to look that way. Do you think this is retaliation for the death of Joe Goodensnake?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I don't know.

SCULLY: Have you talked to Gwen Goodensnake? She seemed pretty upset last night.

SHERIFF TSKANY: She's gone. Nobody's seen her since the funeral. I put an APB out on her.

SCULLY: And what about Lyle Parker?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I can't find him either.

SCULLY: He could be dead as well. I'll take a look around.

(Mulder is searching an area near the ranchhouse. He finds a fist-sized clump of animal fur and another skin nearby.)

(Scully finds some small animal cages next to a gate. From behind her, she hears a loud growl and turns to see a caged mountain lion snarling at her. She gasps in surprise as the mountain lion claws the metal bars of his cage. She then sees Lyle Parker lying in a field a short distance away.)

(Tskany pulls a very large claw from Charlie Parker's body.)

MULDER: That's not from any animal I've ever seen. Sheriff, I think it's time we had a talk. An exchange of ideas?

(Scully approaches with Lyle Parker, who is wrapped in a blanket.)

SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital. He's suffering from exposure, and when he's been checked out, I'm gonna question him.

(Scully and Parker get into the car and she drives off.)

MULDER: (to Tskany) What are you hiding?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I thought it was over.

MULDER: Over? Is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy on Joe Goodensnake's body? You thought it would all end when he was cremated? What were you afraid we'd find?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I can't tell you. But I'll take you to somebody who can.




SCENE 6
GROVE MEDICAL CLINIC, BROWNING, MONTANA
(Lyle Parker is lying in a hospital bed. A nurse exits with a blood sample, leaving Scully to question him.)

LYLE PARKER: I'm ashamed to say it after what happened after the funeral. I picked up some bourbon, and I don't remember a thing after that. Sometimes when I'm down, I go out to where me and my dad keep stray animals that wander in on the ranch. I just watch them, you know, it keeps things in perspective. (Scully sits in a chair beside the bed) Anyway, my mom, when she was alive, was the one that started keeping those animals. I guess I go out there and think about her, too. God, I must have been really wasted to run around there naked. You must have thought I was one of those animals.

SCULLY: When you did go home, did you talk to your father?

LYLE PARKER: No, he'd have been mad I even went to the funeral. I, I have an, uh, image of him sitting on the front porch but ... I don't remember talking to him. Why?

SCULLY: Your father's dead. I'm sorry. (Lyle closes his eyes) It appears as if he's been attacked by an animal, but I suspect it may be homicide. Lyle, I lost my father recently and I know how overwhelming ...

LYLE PARKER: (in a shaky voice) Was it my fault? By going to the funeral, did it anger them into killing my father?

SCULLY: I don't know.

LYLE PARKER: I can deal with death, you know, living on the ranch, being close to nature and all, you see how it all works. Things are born, things die, everything else falls in between. (near tears) But if I caused it, I brought it on, I couldn't, uh, I, I ...

(He can't finish the sentence. Scully touches his arm in sympathy.)

(Mulder and Tskany are in Ish's house.)

ISH: I saw it once with my own eyes. It was a long time ago. It seems like a dream. I was a boy.

(The three sit close together on the floor.)

MULDER: In 1946? The Watkins case?

ISH: I sense you are different, FBI. You're more open to Native American belief than some Native Americans. (looks at Tskany, who looks downward) You even have an Indian name - Fox. You should be "Running Fox", or "Sneaky Fox".

MULDER: (smiling) Just as long as it's not "Spooky Fox". Tell me, Ish ... what did you see?

ISH: Watkins had been attacked by an animal when he was alone in the woods. His scars healed. He was forgotten, then the murders began. The Tregoes, we realized that Watkins had been attacked by what the Algonquins called the manitou ... an evil spirit capable of changing a man into a beast. To be attacked by a manitou causes the victim to become one.

MULDER: The healed scars on Joe Goodensnake's body.

ISH: A manitou overtakes a man by night, not by full moon. But when its blood lust builds to an uncontrollable level, a man changes to a sickening creature. It kills, releasing the savage energy. The man returns to his true self, unaware of what has happened. The cycle begins anew the next day. This continues until death. One night, when I was 16 years old, I was coming back from fishing at the Cut Bank Creek. I knew a shortcut behind Watkins' house. There was a groan, not animal but not human. I looked into his window. He was covered in sweat and blood. He was in a great, great pain. His arm - the skin ripped. It tore up and fell to the floor. Claws sprang from his fingernails. He turned, screaming, and he saw me. His eyes ... his eyes were still human. They begged me to kill him. If I had been hunting and had my gun, I'd have done it without a second thought, but being a boy and scared to death, I ran away.

MULDER: Shortly after, the police killed him.

ISH: But the manitou rose again.

MULDER: Eight years later. But with Watkins dead, how could there have been an attack by manitou?

ISH: Watkins had a son. It could be passed along blood lines.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Gwen. If Joe Goodensnake was this creature, then perhaps it didn't originate in him by the first attack but was handed down through the blood lines. This means Gwen could have it also. Gwen could have killed Parker.

(There is a noise outside the door. The three, all armed, rush outside but don't see anything at first. Mulder waves Ish back. Ish's truck starts, and Gwen appears in the front seat. She backs out toward the road.)

MULDER: Gwen!

(Mulder and Tskany run after her.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: Hey!

(Tskany reaches the truck as it comes to a stop. He reaches in and shuts off the motor.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: No! No!

(Tskany pulls her out of the car and onto the ground.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: You're under arrest, Gwen, for stealing Ish's car!

ISH: What happened, Gwen? What are you running away from?

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: (breathless) I saw it. I, I saw it kill Parker.

MULDER: Let her up.

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: (crying) I went there after the funeral. I was gonna mess up the kid, and so I waited. But Parker was on the porch, and then this thing, this animal - oh my God. I've never been so scared. I ran and I hid in the woods all day. I wanted to get out ... I wanted to get out of here. I wanted to get out of here. (Tskany puts his arms around her) Oh, oh.

ISH: Bring her inside.

(Mulder and Ish nod to each other as Tskany helps her back to the house.)

(At the hospital, a nurse hands the phone to a doctor.)

DR. JOSEPHS: (to nurse) Thank you. (to phone) Hello, this is Dr. Josephs.

(Mulder is calling from Ish's house.)

MULDER: Yeah, this is Agent Mulder from the FBI. I was told I could reach Agent Scully at this number.

DR. JOSEPHS: Oh, yes, we released Lyle Parker from the hosptial and she's taking him back to the ranch.

MULDER: So I can reach her there?

DR. JOSEPHS: Uh-huh. They just left. (pauses) Agent Mulder, there's something I feel you should know. I received a blood test performed on Lyle Parker, and there's something rather unsettling.

MULDER: What's that?

DR. JOSEPHS: Traces of his father's blood type. It can only be there by ingestion.

(In late twilight, Scully drives Lyle Parker back to the ranch. Lyle appears to be dozing, but opens his eyes ominously.)




SCENE 7
(Under a full moon, Scully and Lyle have arrived at the ranch. They enter and Scully tries the light switch.)

SCULLY: Power's out.

LYLE PARKER: Yep. Happens to us all the time, being out here in the sticks. I'll fire up the generator.

(He walks across the room but doubles over in pain, leaning over a railing. Scully comes to assist him.)

SCULLY: You OK?

LYLE PARKER: (gasping) I feel sick. Please, help me into the bathroom.

(Scully does.)

(Mulder and Tskany are speeding down a road, with the lights flashing on top of the vehicle. Mulder is trying his cell phone.)

MULDER: Damn! It keeps disconnecting. The mountain must be blocking the signal. How much farther?

SHERIFF TSKANY: About 7 miles.

(He speeds up.)

(At the ranch, Lyle is in the bathroom. He takes off his coat and runs the water, while Scully calls to him from outside.)

SCULLY: Lyle? Let me come in. Lyle, I want to take you back to the hospital, OK?

LYLE PARKER: No. I'll be all right.

(Mulder and Tskany are still speeding toward the ranch.)

SCULLY: Lyle? Lyle, answer me. Lyle, are you all right?

(Lyle rips off his shirt and flexes his back. Scully squats to inspect the lock on the door. Inside, Lyle begins to transform, showing large fangs. Scully starts unscrewing the door lock with a screwdriver, while Lyle gasps and rips at the curtains inside. He growls and his skin starts to tear.)

(Mulder and Tskany are just entering the ranch.)

(Scully has gotten one screw out of the door. Suddenly a large, furry arm breaks through the upper part of the door, startling Scully. She drops her flashlight as she falls backward.)

(Mulder and Tskany pull up at the ranchhouse. Mulder enters and tries the light switch. He doesn't see or hear any sign of either Scully or Lyle. He quietly moves through the house and turns on a small flashlight, seeing a large set of scratches on the wall. He picks up Scully's flashlight.)

MULDER: (whispering loudly) Scully?

(Tskany is looking around outside. His flashlight catches the mountain lion, still in its cage.)

(Mulder continues through the house, moving into the kitchen. He hears a roar behind him and turns to see a large, furry creature run into the next room. He fires twice but doesn't hit it. He follows the creature and starts up the stairs. As he nears the landing, there is another roar and Mulder turns, instinctively firing above him at something. It is only a mounted bear head. Mulder gets up and continues to the top of the stairs. A nearby noise startles him.)

MULDER: Augh!

SCULLY: (coming out of the shadows) It's OK, it's me. It's me. I don't know what happened. Something jumped me downstairs and I lost my gun.

MULDER: I heard it come up here. Come on.

SCULLY: (breathless) OK.

(They continue into the next room, Mulder leading the way with a flashlight. They hear a faint growl. They move into the next room. From the corner, a beast springs out to attack. Mulder wheels to fire, but before he can, a rifle blast is heard. Tskany has shot the beast.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: You all right?

(Mulder shines the flashlight at the beast.)

SCULLY: Oh my God! (Lyle lies dead in the corner) He was in the bathroom, sick, and then the next thing I knew we were attacked by the mountain lion.

MULDER: It wasn't a mountain lion, Scully.

SHERIFF TSKANY: It's still in a cage out back.

(The next day, Mulder, Scully and Tskany come out of the sheriff's office.)

MULDER: Where's Gwen? She said she'd come see us before we left.

SHERIFF TSKANY: She left last night. Gave away all her possessions to her friends.

MULDER: Just pulled up and left? Why would she do that?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Brother's gone, no family. Trouble with Parker is all over. Maybe she saw something that she wasn't ready to understand.

SCULLY: Maybe.

MULDER: (shaking Tskany's hand) Thank you.

(He walks off. Scully shakes Tskany's hand as well, then follows Mulder. Mulder opens the car door.)

ISH: (standing on a porch) FBI! See you in about ... eight years.

MULDER: I hope not.

(They smile and nod at each other.)

(Mulder and Scully drive off through the fog-shrouded mountains.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
OLYMPIC NATIONAL FOREST; NORTHWEST WASHINGTON STATE; PRESENT DAY
(In the forest, a large group of loggers are congregated loosely around two people in the center, who are arguing.)

DYER: You’re supposed to be in charge here, Perkins.

PERKINS: I am in charge.

DYER: Well, these men want some answers. They want to know what you’re plan is.
Let’s face it, this thing could kill us all.

PERKINS: We should’ve been gone two days ago. Nobody would listen to me.

DYER: Nobody knew what it was two days ago, Perkins. Nobody knows now.

PERKINS: Somebody has to go for help.

DYER: What about the rest of us? What are we supposed to do? Just wait here until help arrives?

PERKINS: We have to take a chance, one of us has to hike out!

DYER: That person might not make it in time. He might not make it down to the road before nightfall! Then what? I say we make a run for it, split up, take our chances!

(The men murmur and yell in agreement.)

PERKINS: It’s suicide, Dyer.

(Dyer walks right up to him.)

DYER: Fine. You stay here. Tell us how it turns out.

(He pushes past him. The men start to run. Perkins runs with them. Indiscernible yells can be heard.)

MAN: Hurry up!

(Perkins runs after Dyer.)

ANOTHER MAN: You’re going the wrong way!

(It is sundown, and now nightfall. Animals screech and howl. Dyer trips over a log and grunts. Perkins jumps over the log and kneels down beside him. Dyer checks his ankle.)

DYER: I think it’s broken.

PERKINS: Come on, you got to get up.

DYER: I don’t think I can make it.

(Perkins lifts Dyer to his feet. He tries to help Dyer, but Dyer grunts and moans in pain.)

PERKINS: We gotta keep moving.

(Dyer falls to his knees.)

DYER: We’re not going to make it. We’re not going...

(A humming starts within the forest. Perkins and Dyer look around frantically. The humming grows louder and louder. They look up to see a giant swarm of green bugs coming down towards them. Dyer screams. Perkins can do nothing but look on in horror.)




SCENE 2
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(A slide is up of the loggers. Scully is sitting at a desk. Mulder sits down in front of the slide.)

MULDER: Take a good look, Scully.

SCULLY: What am I looking at?

MULDER: Thirty loggers working a clear-cutting contract in Washington State.
Rugged, manly men in the full bloom of their manhood.

SCULLY: Right, but what am I looking for?

MULDER: Anything strange, unexplainable, unlikely... boyfriend?

SCULLY: I don’t know, I... I give up, Mulder.

MULDER: You give up? Funny, that’s apparently what the Federal Forest Service has done as well.

SCULLY: Why, what happened to them?

(Mulder changes the slide to a blank screen.)

MULDER: In a word, they vanished. Or so it would appear.

(He changes the slide to two men.)

This is Doug Spinney and Steven Teague. They call themselves "monkey wrenchers." The guys who drive spikes into trees, sabotage logging equipment and otherwise make life miserable for lumberjacks and lumbermills.

(Scully stands and walks towards him.)

SCULLY: Ecoterrorists or militant environmentalists.

MULDER: Right. Two weeks ago, the group of loggers I just showed you radioed a message that Spinney and Teague had gone on a spree. Spiking trees, sabotaging equipment, causing general mischief. One week later, all radio communication was cut off.

SCULLY: Do they know why?

MULDER: No. The lumber company that employs the men has asked the Federal Forest Service to look into the matter. Two officials were sent in a week ago and no one has heard from them since.

SCULLY: It appears as if these monkey wrenchers are doing more than just a little mischief-making.

MULDER: That’s what the lumber company and the Federal Forest Service are accusing.
They’ve asked the F.B.I. to investigate. I had to pull a few strings to make sure we got the case.

(He walks over to his desk.)

SCULLY: For an ecoterrorism case? Do I dare ask why?

(He changes the slide to an old picture of some lumberjacks dressed in 1930’s clothes.)

MULDER: In 1934, long before anyone even knew what an ecoterrorist was, a W.P.A. crew vanished from that same area without a trace. Not one of those men was ever found or heard from again.

SCULLY: And you suspect what? Bigfoot?

MULDER: Not likely. That’s a lot of flannel to be choking down even for Bigfoot.

(Scully smiles.)

Come on, Scully, it’ll be a nice trip to the forest.

(Scully looks back at the picture.)




SCENE 3
RANGER STATION; OLYMPIC NATIONAL FOREST; NORTHWEST WASHINGTON STATE
(A truck carrying lumber drives by as Mulder and Scully pull into the parking spaces. Ranger Moore is looking at a map on the hood of his truck. He looks up at them as they walk over.)

MULDER: Hi. Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully, we’re with the F.B.I.

MOORE: Larry Moore, Federal Forest Service.

(He shakes both their hands.)

You can put your gear in the back of the truck.

(Mulder takes Scully’s bag and puts it and his bag into the back.)

SCULLY: Must be pretty rugged where we’re going, huh?

MOORE: Yeah.

MULDER: What’s that in your windshield there? Is that a bullet hole?

MOORE: .22 caliber.

MULDER: Somebody took a shot at you?

MOORE: So it would appear. There’s not much to hunt around here with that type of ammo except Freddies.

SCULLY: "Freddies?"

MOORE: Employees of the Federal Forest Service. It’s, uh, it’s what the ecoterrorists call us.

MULDER: Is that who you think took a shot at you?

MOORE: Let me get this out of the way. I have no quarrel with these ecoterrorists in principle. And I’m as concerned for this forest and the environment as anybody. It’s their methods I can’t condone.

SCULLY: Do you think they’d go so far as to kill a man?

MOORE: Well, there’s thirty men up there unaccounted for, each with survival experience. Something happened to them.

(He takes his papers off of the hood and walks around them. A man walks over to them with a bag and some other things.)

HUMPHREYS: Sorry I’m late. I was down talking to Bob Perkins’ wife. He’s one of our missing loggers. Hey, Larry.

MOORE: Hey.

(He hands Moore a yellow box.)

HUMPHREYS: Steve Humphreys, head of security for Schiff-Immergut Lumber.

(He shakes both their hands.)

MULDER: Mulder, Scully.

HUMPHREYS: Well, we’ve got a four hour drive ahead of us. Plenty of time to get to know each other.

(Moore gets in the driver’s seat, Humphreys gets into the passengers side.)

SCULLY: Get the impression that we’ve walked into the middle of a war that’s already started?

(Mulder smiles as Scully heads towards the back. Later, down the road, they’re driving.
It’s drizzling and the windshield wipers are on.)

Why do these men work so far up in the wilderness?

HUMPHREYS: That’s where the trees are.

SCULLY: You’re kidding, right?

HUMPHREYS: No, environmentalists have pretty much made sure that all the land you see here is untouchable. We’re forced to take our timber where we can get it. Even then, we plant saplings for every tree we take.

MULDER: So why do the ecoterrorists target you?

HUMPHREYS: See, these tree-huggers comes from the same kind of boys that went up to Canada during the Vietnam war. They’re cowardly and so are their tactics.

(The car starts shaking wildly.)

MOORE: Damn it.

(They get out and we see that there is a spike in the tire.)

Homemade tire spike. Clear through the sidewall. It’s unfixable.

MULDER: You got a spare, don’t you?

HUMPHREYS: Right tire’s history too.

(Humphreys holds up a weird-shaped piece of metal almost completely made up of jagged edges.)

Monkey wrenchers call it a caltrop. The roads back here are littered with them. Indiscriminate terrorism. Can you imagine somebody putting these down or spiking the roads of Washington, D.C.? I’d like to see how much sympathy they get then.

SCULLY: So how are we going to get up to the camp?

(Moore walks past them and puts his bag over his shoulder.)

MOORE: We’re going to have to hike.

(They watch him walk. The mountains are practically steaming as the rain releases the heat on the ground. The four get to the campsite, which is abandoned. There is scattered machinery and cars.)

Anybody here?

(Mulder and Scully walk into the cabin and see that there is still dinner sitting on the table, food intact.)

MULDER: Someone forgot to clean their plate.

SCULLY: Looks like they left in a hurry too.

(Scully walks into the bathroom. Mulder rubs his finger across the top of the refrigerator door and picks up some sticky film on his finger. He picks a plastic bag up, opens it, smells it, and closes it. Humphreys walks in.)

HUMPHREYS: Find anything?

(Mulder holds up the bag.)

MULDER: Party favors.

(Scully walks out of the bathroom.)

HUMPHREYS: All the vehicles have all been monkey wrenched, power generator’s busted.

SCULLY: Somebody really turned this place upside-down.

HUMPHREYS: Whoever did it didn’t want the fact broadcast, either.

(The radio on the desk next to him is smashed in. He picks up a piece and throws it back down. Outside, Moore opens up the radiator and pulls out some rice. Mulder, Scully and Humphreys walk over to the side of him.)

MOORE: Radiators are all full of rice. Looks like sugar or sand in the crankcases. They really did a number here.

(Humphreys looks at his watch.)

HUMPHREYS: Sun’s going down in an hour and a half.

MOORE: Better take a look around before it gets dark.

(He picks up his bag and walks off.)

HUMPHREYS: I’ll see if I can get that generator working.

(He walks off too.)

SCULLY: Well, you were right about one thing.

MULDER: What’s that?

SCULLY: It definitely wasn’t Bigfoot.

(Scully, Mulder and Moore walk through a wasteland full of broken branches and giant tree stumps. They soon come back to actual forest. Mulder spots a cocoon-ish sort of web tied to a long branch horizontally.)

MULDER: Look at that.

SCULLY: What is it?

MOORE: Looks like a hive. Maybe a cocoon of some kind.

MULDER: Made by what?

MOORE: I don’t know, I’ve never seen anything like it.

(Moore and Mulder hoist Scully up on a pulley swing to the cocoon. She grabs the branch.)

SCULLY: Got it.

MOORE: Can you cut it down?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.

(She takes out a swiss army knife and is about to cut through the webbing when something catches her eye. Rotting fingers protruding through a part of the web.)

MULDER: You alright, Scully?

(Soon after, Moore cuts open the cocoon. He and Scully pull it apart to reveal a half-rotted human.)

SCULLY: Oh God...

(She reaches in and feels the body’s neck and face.)

It feels, uh... it feels dessicated and hard and dry, almost... preserved.

MOORE: Like it’s been enbalmed.

SCULLY: No, more like all the fluids have been bled from this body. Almost like it’s been cured.

(She feels the body some more.)

I think... it’s a male.

MULDER: Barely.

MOORE: I’d say it’s, uh, some kind of spider’s nest or insect cocoon.

SCULLY: What kind of an insect could have gotten a man all the way up into that tree?

(Mulder stands and looks up.)

MULDER: Itsy-bitsy spider.

(Back at camp, Humphreys tries to fix the generator when he hears the door creaking. He picks up his shotgun and moves around to the front, looking around. He hears a clanking inside the house. Somebody is eating and drinking the leftover food. He puts a cup to his mouth when Humphreys comes in.)

HUMPHREYS: Don’t move. Who are you?

(The man puts the cup down and turns around.)

Doug Spinney. I oughta shoot you where you stand.

SPINNEY: Might as well shoot yourself too.

HUMPHREYS: You’re in a hell of a spot to be testing me. What happened to my men?

(Spinney walks over to the cupboard. Humphreys walks the same way, still aiming his gun at him.)

SPINNEY: What men?

HUMPHREYS: The men who were working this camp.

SPINNEY: I don’t know what happened to them. Probably the same thing that’ll happen to us when the sun goes down.

(Spinney looks out the window. Mulder, Scully and Moore come in.)

MULDER: What are you doing?

HUMPHREYS: This animal is Doug Spinney. He’s the man responsible for all the monkey wrenching. He’s probably a murderer as well.

SPINNEY: I’m no murderer.

HUMPHREYS: You’re a liar.

MULDER: Let’s just hear what he has to say.

(Mulder puts his hand on Humphreys’ shotgun. Humpreys lowers it.)

SPINNEY: If we stand around here talking, there’ll be nothing left to say. I’d start thinking about how to get that generator started. Darkness is our enemy.

(Spinney walks past them to the door, where Scully and Moore are standing.)

HUMPHREYS: What’s he talking about?

SPINNEY: Someone want to give me a hand?

(He and Moore walk out.)

HUMPHREYS: Now he’s giving orders? I’m the one who fixed the damn thing!

MULDER: Hey, it’s alright.

(Spinney, followed by the other four, walks to the generator, unscrewing the cap off of a gas tank.)

Why did you say that darkness was our enemy?

SPINNEY: That’s when they come.

(He pours some petroleum in.)

SCULLY: When who comes?

SPINNEY: I don’t know what it is. They come from the sky, take a man right off his feet and devour him alive. I saw it happen.

MULDER: Happen to who?

(Moore screws the cap back on as Spinney starts the generator. It works.)

SPINNEY: I need to eat. I haven’t eaten in three days.

(He walks past them back into the cabin.)

HUMPHREYS: What kind of a B.S. story is that, huh? You believe that?

SCULLY: We found something in the forest.

HUMPHREYS: What?

MOORE: A man caught in some kind of insect cocoon.

(In the cabin, Spinney starts to devour a bowl of stew. Mulder sits across from him. Scully is sitting next to them. Moore stands behind them and Humphreys sits off to the side.)

MULDER: What happened here?

SPINNEY: We camped two valleys over, four of us. Three now.

HUMPHREYS: More rats for the wood pile.

SPINNEY: Our truck has a dead battery so we drew straws to see who would make the hike over here to steal one from the loggers.

(Moore pours Mulder and Scully some tea.)

MULDER: Why not just hike out?

SPINNEY: More than a day’s hike. No way we’d want to be caught out in the forest after dark.
Not after what happened to Teague.

SCULLY: That’s the man you said that was devoured alive?

SPINNEY: Yeah.

MULDER: What are you guys doing out here?

SPINNEY: Camping.

HUMPHREYS: Yeah, right. The kind of camping you do is a federal offense.

(Moore sits down.)

MULDER: Just, just hold off a second, okay?

MOORE: No, he’s right. This man is an admitted felon. He could be placed under arrest.

SPINNEY: (to Humphreys) What about your offense, my friend, huh? What about the offense against nature you perpetrate?

HUMPHREYS: We operate completely within the law. We pay for the right to take those trees.

SPINNEY: Oh, yeah? Well, I got news for you. Your logging crew has taken trees that nobody has the right to, trees that are marked and protected so don’t talk to me about breaking the law! Sir.

MOORE: They’ve been taking marked trees?

SPINNEY: Yes sir, marked in orange.

MOORE: Old growth trees? You know anything about that, Steve?

HUMPHREYS: No.

(He gets up and takes his coat.)

You going to take this man’s word over mine?

(No answer. He puts his coat on.)

SPINNEY: You don’t want to go out in the night. Take my word on that. It’s out there.

HUMPHREYS: What? If I go out that door, something’s going to attack me, eat me alive and spin me in it’s web?

SPINNEY: Yes.

HUMPHREYS: What, it’s too polite to come in here and get me?

SPINNEY: For some reason, it’s, uh, afraid of the light.

HUMPHREYS: It’s afraid of the light.

MOORE: There may be something to what he’s saying, Steve.

HUMPHREYS: You know what I think? I think this man is a liar and a murderer and just clever enough to make up a story like that. Even whip up that cocoon just to save a few trees and I’m going to prove I’m right.

(He walks out, shotgun in hand.)

This is ridiculous. Where is it, Spinney?

(Mulder and Scully walk outside a little. Spinney and Moore stand in the doorway.)

I thought it was going to come and, uh, devour me!

(The bug zapper starts going off fairly rapidly.)

Hey! Here I am! Come out, come out wherever you! Aw, don’t be shy!

(Behind a tree crawls millions of the same little green bugs as before.)

Come on! Huh?

(He starts back.)

It’s just like a told ya. There’s nothing out here but a bunch of trees. Trees that this man values more than human life. And I’m going to see him tried on murder charges.

(He walks past them and into the cabin.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder) What do you think?

MULDER: I think I’m going to suggest that we sleep with the lights on.

(Scully sighs and they walk inside, Mulder closing the door behind him. The bug zapper goes off a few more times. Morning. Spinney leads the other to a huge tree cut down. It has an orange "X" on it.)

SPINNEY: You see this Douglas Fir? It’s been standing here since before your time and your men cut it down.

SCULLY: Who marks these trees?

MOORE: Federal Forest Service. They’re only supposed to cut trees with a blue "X."

(Mulder stands on the stump.)

MULDER: This tree must be hundreds of years old.

MOORE: At least.

SCULLY: You must get a lot of lumber from a big tree like this.

SPINNEY: Thousands of boards. Hell of a lot easier than taking a lot of smaller, younger trees.

HUMPHREYS: Well, let me remind you that monkey wrenchers like Spinney here are not above marking trees with their own paint.

MOORE: This tree’s 500 years old if it’s a day, Steve.

MULDER: Hey, look at this.

(Moore walks over. Mulder points out a yellowish-green ring near the center.)

What would this represent?

MOORE: I don’t know. I’ve never seen a ring like that before.

SCULLY: Those center rings are the older rings, right?

MOORE: Yeah. Every ring represents a season growth. And you see these?

(He points out the very center rings.)

These are 500, 600 years old. They’re a recorded history of rainfall and climate. But this one... I dont know. I should take a core sample.

(He takes off his backpack.)

HUMPHREYS: Have we finished with this nature walk? I want an answer to what happened to those loggers.

SCULLY: That’s what we’re trying to determine, sir.

HUMPHREYS: Looking at a tree stump? Don’t you think you should be interrogating this man?

(He points to Spinney.)

MULDER: I don’t think he did it.

HUMPHREYS: Well, I think he did and I want him arrested.

MULDER: Well, he’s not going anywhere!

HUMPHREYS: No, not with a gun on him. But what happens when you’re poking around and his three buddies show up and do to you what they probably did to those two Federal Forest officers? Huh? Larry?

MOORE: I just want to take a core sample of this tree, Steve.

HUMPHREYS: Hey, I got families down there who want some answers about their loved ones and so do you! Answers that aren’t going to be found in that tree.

SPINNEY: Only crime we’re here to investigate is the death of that tree.

HUMPHREYS: Yeah, we’ll see about that.

(He starts off.)

MOORE: Steve, where you going?

(He stops and turns around.)

HUMPHREYS: I’m going to hike down to your truck, get on the horn and get some people up here who’ll take some action!

MOORE: Steve!

SPINNEY: Aw, let him go. Let him find out for himself.

(Humphreys walks off. Back at the cabin, Moore is looking at the core sample through a microscope.)

MOORE: This is odd. This yellow ring’s got something living in it, some kind of… tiny bug. It doesn’t make sense.

(Mulder looks into the scope.)

SCULLY: Why not?

(Inside the sample are thousands of tiny bugs scampering around.)

MOORE: Well, parasites attack a tree in a variety of ways, but they always attack the living parts. The leaves, the roots, the new growth rings. Even if they’re borers of something, they wouldn’t be working so deep in the tree.

MULDER: Maybe the wood in this ring is different. They’re feeding on it.

SCULLY: Can you identify them?

(Mulder gets up. She slides the microscope over and looks in.)

MOORE: It’s a wood mite of some kind. It’s nothing I’ve ever seen before.

MULDER: Could they have been living in that tree for hundreds of years?

MOORE: I don’t see how. I mean, these inner rings are essentially dead wood. The tree’s vascular system is limited to the outer few rings, they need water to survive.

SCULLY: Well, they appear to be hatching out of the porous wood. Maybe when you drew out this core, you tapped into a larger nest.

SPINNEY: Can they build a cocoon?

(They turn to see Spinney walk in.)

Right after that tree was cut down is when Teague died. It’s about the same time the loggers disappeared too.

SCULLY: You think these mites are what killed the men?

SPINNEY: Maybe they been lying there dormant for hundreds of years. Maybe they woke up hungry.

(Humphreys marches through the woods and gets in the truck. He puts his bag down and notices there is no key. He checks around but cannot find one.)

HUMPHREYS: Damn it!

(He sighs. Night falls as he tries to hotwire the car. With no success, he gets out and goes to the front hood. He looks around with a flashlight, turning knobs. A humming begins. He looks around, then picks up his shotgun.)

Alright, you monkey wrenchers! Come on out now!

(He shines it into the trees. Nothing.)

I know what you’re up to!

(Still nothing. The humming grows louder. He looks to see the mites swarming down to him. He runs into the car and closes both doors. Looking up at them through the windshield, he tries to jumpstart the car again. The engine finally turns. He shifts gears and pushes down on the accelerator, but the car doesn’t move. He shifts gears and tries again, but still nothing. The swarm grows closer. He finally pulls out but hits a rock in front of him. He pushes forward into the steering wheel, honking the horn. He shifts gears but sees the swarm gather around the car. They seep in through the filtration. He tries to open the door but it is jammed by another rock. He tries to push the door open repeatedly with no luck until the bugs overwhelm him. He claws at the window, screaming. Back at the cabin, the generator keeps running. Scully is still looking through the microscope as Moore and Mulder walk around. Spinney sits on a table.)

MOORE: Humphreys should have been back by now.

SCULLY: These bugs aren’t moving anymore. They’re either dead or they’re asleep.

SPINNEY: It’s the light. They don’t like the light.

SCULLY: That’s weird, I mean, usually bugs are attracted to light.

SPINNEY: These obviously are not your ordinary bugs to say the least.

(Mulder runs his fingers over more surfaces. He picks up more of the film he found before.)

MULDER: What do you know about insects, Scully?

SCULLY: Uh, just what I learned in my biology courses. That they’re the foundation of our ecosystem. That there’s lots of them, something like 200 million per person on this planet.

MULDER: And they’ve been around a long time, right?

SCULLY: Yeah, something like 600 million years, even before the dinosaurs. Why?

MULDER: And this tree is what, 5, 6, 700 years old?

MOORE: Yeah.

MULDER: And these rings represent a history of climatic changes, which means that in this year or season in the life of the tree, there was some kind of strange event that produced an abnormal ring.

SCULLY: Well, like what, exactly?

MULDER: A volcanic eruption. This whole chain of mountains running from Washington to Oregon is still extremely active. Remember Mt. St. Helens?

SCULLY: Yeah, but how does that explain the bugs?

MULDER: When Mt. St. Helens erupted, there was a large amount of radiation that was released from inside the earth. Strange things started to grow. There’s actually this lake where they’ve discovered a kind of amoeba that can literally suck a man’s brains out.

SCULLY: Oh, a brain-sucking amoeba.

SPINNEY: No, it’s true. Spirit Lake. And there’s documented cases of swimmers being infected.

SCULLY: But an amoeba is a single-celled organism. It can be mutated. An insect is a complex animal. It would take years and years to evolve.

MULDER: Well, then maybe what we’re dealing with isn’t a mutation at all. What if it’s some kind of... extinct insect larvae in that ring, deposited during a period of volcanic activity, brought up through the tree’s root system. Ancient insect eggs. Thousands, maybe millions of years old lying
dormant until...

SPINNEY: Until those loggers cut down that tree.

(He stands.)

That would be rather poetic justice, don’t you think? Unleashing the very thing that would end up killing them and your friend Humphreys?

(He walks past Moore to the bedroom door.)

And who knows? Maybe us. Sweet dreams.

(He goes inside.)

MOORE: Humphreys might have just hiked out of here. We don’t know that he didn’t.
Maybe we’re letting ourselves get carried away with this bug story.

MULDER: Yeah, maybe.

(Sunrise. Spinney skulks through the cabin, grabs his bag and goes outside. He goes to the side of the cabin and takes the gas tank. He starts unscrewing a truck battery when Mulder sneaks up on him and points a gun.)

Going somewhere?

SPINNEY: No, I was just...

MULDER: Doing a little auto repair. Looks to me like you’re planning on cutting out of here.

SPINNEY: I gotta save my friends. They only had enough gas to keep their generator running fifteen, twenty hours max. They’re gonna die if I don’t get back there.

MULDER: So why are you sneaking around?

SPINNEY: Freddy. Forest Service guy, he wouldn’t go for it. He’d never trust me.

MULDER: He’s got no reason to. Neither do I.

SPINNEY: Look, I can save us all, man. We’ve got a jeep over there, it’s just two valleys over, all it needs is a battery. Now, I can get there, I can get back here in the morning. We can all drive out tomorrow. You got to trust me, man.

(Later. Mulder is fixing the radio. It turns on, but all it gets is static.)

MULDER: Radio is back up.

(Scully runs in.)

SCULLY: It’s working?

MULDER: I’m not getting any reception so the reciever could be trashed.

SCULLY: What about transmissions, could we send a message?

MULDER: We could try.

(He picks up the transmitter.)

This is a call for help, is there anyone at this frequency?

(Static. He adjusts the frequency control, but still only gets static.)

This is Special Agent Mulder of the F.B.I., we have an emergency and a possible quarantine situation. Our position is...

(He nudges Scully to go get the map, which she does. Suddenly, the generator goes out.
They walk to the side of the house where Moore is.)

What happened to the generator?

MOORE: I turned it off.

MULDER: Well, turn it back on, I got the radio working.

MOORE: What happened to the gas can?

MULDER: Spinney took it.

MOORE: He took it? You mean he’s gone?

MULDER: He left earlier this morning. He took a battery and some gas. He’s gonna come back for us in the morning.

MOORE: Yeah, what, he gave you his personal guarantee on that?

MULDER: He gave me his word, yeah.

MOORE: Did you stop to think that the man who gave you his word has made an art out of sabotage? And defying authority? And is probably the same man who put the bullet through my windshield?

MULDER: Well, what would you have done? At least now we’ve got one chance of getting out of here alive which is one more chance than we had before.

MOORE: Or one less.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MOORE: Your partner let Spinney leave with the last of the gas. This generator’s got about a quarter tank left, maybe less.

SCULLY: What about the gas in the trucks?

MULDER: There is no more gas, the other tanks have all been ruptured or filled with sugar.

MOORE: By the same man who we are now trusting to keep his word and come back for us.

SCULLY: Well, then we’ve got to get back on the radio, we’ve got to send out a mayday.

MOORE: Every drop of fuel we waste is fuel that’s gonna keep this gennie powered tonight. I mean, I don’t want to be waiting around hoping somebody heard that transmission when this thing quits running about two o’clock in the morning. Do you?

(He walks back in the cabin. Scully looks at Mulder, who does not look back. He sighs. Mulder walks into the cabin and groans, knowing he made the wrong move. Scully walks in and closes the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Look, it’s done. I shouldn’t have let him go. Let’s just move past it, okay?

SCULLY: Fine. What do you suggest?

MULDER: I don’t know. We’ll think of something.

SCULLY: Look, I think we both have a pretty good idea of what happened to those loggers and what happened to the group in 1934.

MULDER: We only found one cocoon.

(He stands and crosses to the door.)

SCULLY: It’s a big forest.

MULDER: Look, Scully, what would you have done?

SCULLY: You mean, would I have made a decision by myself that would have affected the whole group?

MULDER: Oh, will you cut the sanctimonious crap?

SCULLY: Well, what do you want me to say? Let’s face it, Mulder, we might die up here! If we’re lucky, they’ll find our bodies spun up in a tree or they may not find us at all!

MULDER: You’re right. And we’re wasting time arguing about it.

(Mulder walks past her to the window. She walks over to him after a few seconds.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: Button this place up. If we’re gonna spend the night in here, we’ve got to do everything we can to make sure the bugs stay out there.

(Mulder hammers some sheets to the wall with boards. Moore walks in carrying more supplies. Scully is screwing in the light bulb.)

MOORE: I’d be careful with that. It’s the only bulb that works.

(Nightfall. The generator keeps running, rougher. Mulder and Scully lay on cots, Moore sits on his bed. They all watch the lightbulb work. Scully looks into the corner and sees the mites running around in the shadows.)

SCULLY: I can see them. You guys, look at this.

(She walks over to the corner. They follow.)

Look, they’re coming through the wall down where it’s dark. You see them?

(She leans forward and looks at her hand. As her shadow covers it, she sees mites crawling all over her. She lets out a loud gasp. She stands and starts trying to brush them off.)

They’re on me.

MULDER: It’s alright, Scully, Scully...

(She walks backwards, rubbing her arms.)

SCULLY: Get them off me!

MULDER: Stop moving! Stop!

(She flails her arms wildly, smacking the lightbulb. Moore reaches forward and grabs it.)

MOORE: Whoa, watch it!

(Mulder grabs her and holds her against the wall.)

MULDER: Stand still! Stand still!

SCULLY: Can you see them? Mulder, get them off me!

MULDER: They’re not just on you. They’re everywhere. I think that’s what that greasy residue is over everything.

SCULLY: I thought we were supposed to be safe in the light!

MULDER: We are. I think the light keeps them from swarming. We’ll be safe as long as we stay in the light.

(The mites continue to crawl in the shadows. Later. The tank on the generator is nearly empty. Everyone is sitting back down.)

How are you doing?

SCULLY: I’m okay.

(They both take a deep breath. Later, they sit together and watch the mites crawl around.)

They’re oxidizing enzymes. Just like fireflies. Maybe that’s why they cocoon their prey... so they can oxidize the proteins taken from the fluids in the body.

(The light nearly fades out. They look at it. It builds back to normal again. We can hear the generator running out of fuel outside.)

What if the generator goes? Are they all going to swarm in here and drain the life out of us?

MULDER: We got an hour and a half till sunrise.

SCULLY: And then what? It’s over a day’s hike out of here. We won’t make it on foot by nightfall.

MULDER: Maybe somebody heard our radio transmission. Help could be on the way.

SCULLY: Oh, you sent that call hours ago. I mean, help would have been here by now.

MULDER: Well, I’m not going to give up on Spinney. He gave me his word he’d come back to get us.

SCULLY: And if he doesn’t?

MULDER: We’ll think of something.

(The generator sputters out and dies. The light bulb slowly fades out. But light still shines through the other way. Mulder and Scully turn around to see that the sun is rising slowly. Mulder and Moore run out to the truck and check the tires.)

You got a patch kit or an extra tube in your truck?

MOORE: Yeah.

MULDER: Maybe we can patch this or at least get it to hold some air. With the spare in your truck, maybe we can limp down the mountain. If not, at least we can get on the radio and warn them what’s out there.

(Mulder, Scully and Moore hike down to the truck. Mulder is rolling the spare tire. They get to the truck and walk towards it.)

MOORE: See it?

MULDER: Yeah.

(They look through the driver’s side window to see what’s left of Humphreys leaning against the door, cocooned. They hear a low humming.)

MOORE: Listen. You hear that? It’s a car!

(They turn to see a jeep barreling down the road.)

MULDER: No, it’s a jeep!

(The jeep swerves to a stop and the three run to it. Spinney opens the door.)

SPINNEY: We gotta move, let’s go! Let’s go!

MOORE: Wait! What about the body... Humphrey’s body?

SPINNEY: Leave it, I’ve radioed for help.

(Scully gets into the passenger side.)

MULDER: What happened to your friends?

SPINNEY: They didn’t make it. We’re not going to make it either unless we haul ass!

(The two get in the car and they drive back the way they came. The headlights go on as a fog envelopes the road and it grows dark. Everything is fine until they hit a row of caltrops.)

Damn it!

(He gets out of the car and looks at the tires.)

I don’t believe it.

MOORE: When you talk about shooting yourself in the foot...

(Moore opens the door and looks out. A familiar buzzing grows. Suddenly, Spinney is attacked by the swarm. Moore watches from outside the car.)

MULDER: Get out of there! Get back in the car!

(Moore gets back in the car and they watch as Spinney helplessly tries to stop the onslaught. Spinney slams his fists down on the hood, moaning and screaming, until he runs off. The mites begin to seep into the car. The three try to brush the mites away as they moan and groan. Their yelling grows louder and longer as they are overwhelmed. Morning. A helicopter flies in as three trucks pull up to the jeep. Men file out, all wearing containment suits. They open up the door and look in the jeep. It is a mess of cocooning and bodies.)

MAN: We have an emergency evacuation situation. Requesting quarantine facility for two, possibly three victims with undiagnosed infection or exposure to unknown biological vectors. Repeat, that’s an emergency evacuation situation. Two, possibly three victims...

(Scully stirs under the cocooning.)




SCENE 4
HIGH CONTAINMENT FACILITY; WINTHROP, WASHINGTON
(A small door slides up and a man in a containment suit takes out a canister.)

ANNOUNCER: Attention, all personnel. High level bio-clearance required on third floor.

(He carrys it into a room with many other containment suited men walking around. One man walks over to Moore, who is on a gurney with machines hooked up. He presses a few buttons on a machine, then does the same for Scully. Mulder walks in, severly burned, dressed in white, wheeling an oxygen tank that is hooked up through his nose.)

MAN: How are you feeling?

MULDER: Better. How did the tests come back?

(The man walks over to a desk and picks up a chart.)

MAN: Your respiratory charts were good. We’re more concerned with the extent of damage due to inhalation. There were large concentrations of the chemical determined as Luciferene.

MULDER: Which is what?

MAN: The same enzymes we find in fireflies and other bioluminescent insects. Our entomologists are still trying to determine the specific epithet of the insects you encountered.

(Mulder and the man walk over to Scully.)

MULDER: Scully?

(She is unconscious with severe burns as well.)

How is she doing?

MAN: She’s still not out of the woods, so to speak. She lost a lot of fluids. Two or three more hours of exposure, she might not have made it.

MULDER: I told her it was going to be a nice trip to the forest.

(The man starts to walk away.)

How you going to contain it to the forest.

(He turns back.)

What if the swarm migrates?

MAN: The government has initiated eradication procedures. They’re quite certain that by using a combination of controlled burns and pesticides, they will be successful.

MULDER: And if they’re not?

MAN: That is not an option, Mr. Mulder.

(He walks out, leaving Mulder to his thoughts.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
DRUID HILL SANITARIUM; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(Barbed wire surroundes a tall reddish-building. Going down a hallway, we can hear screaming, moaning and indiscernible babbling. On various doors, we see name plates like "Walter L, Robbie" and "Schalin, Scott." Under each of the name plates is a small door through which food is passed through. We stop at a door where the name plate reads: "Tooms, Eugene Victor." A face appears through the small door, with evil yellowish eyes. He peers down the hallway then sticks his hand through the slot. He reaches up towards the latch, growling. As he sticks his arm further through, we hear a dull pop as his shoulder dislocates. He smiles and lets out a dull sigh. His breathing becomes slow and heavy, his hand and arm stretching out beyond normal human proportions. His fingers actually grow until they are almost at the lock. The main door in the hallway opens, flooding the dark hallway with light. A man, Dr. Aaron Monte, and a security guard walk down to Tooms' door. Monte knocks on the door.)
AARON MONTE: Eugene?
(He knocks again.)
Eugene, it's Dr. Monte.
(Hearing no answer, he signals to the security guard. The guard unlatches the door and Monte walks inside.)
Eugene, are you asleep?
(Tooms sits up on his bed.)
EUGENE TOOMS: No.
AARON MONTE: I was on my way out and wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.
EUGENE TOOMS: Fine.
(Monte sits down.)
AARON MONTE: Good. You nervous about tomorrow? Don't be. I know you think they won't let you out so I snuck a peek at the reports of the doctors that will testify at your review tomorrow and they concur with my opinion that you're ready to be released from here...
EUGENE TOOMS: Hmmm...
AARON MONTE: And rejoin the community. So...
(He stands.)
Why don't we get some sleep and relax and I'll see you tomorrow at the review, okay?
(He goes over and picks up his coat.)
Let's just keep our fingers crossed.
(He walks out and the security guard closes and latches the door. Tooms looks up from the floor, the same evil yellowish glow as before. Slowly, he crosses his fingers.)




SCENE 2
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WALTER SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Skinner is sitting at his desk, Scully sitting at the opposite side. The Cigarette-Smoking Man is standing behind Skinner next to the window, smoking.)
SKINNER: Agent Scully, we have reviewed your reports and frankly we are quite displeased. Irregular procedure, untenable evidence, anonymous witnesses, inconclusive findings aggravated by vague opinion.
SCULLY: But sir, the very nature of the X-Files cases often precludes orthodox investigation.
SKINNER: Are you suggesting that the bureau adopt separate standards for you and Agent Mulder?
SCULLY: No, sir.
SKINNER: Are you suggesting that Agent Mulder obstructs you from proper procedure?
SCULLY: No, sir. If anything, I'm suggesting that these cases be reviewed with... an open mind.
SKINNER: Maybe your mind has become too open.
SCULLY: On X-Files cases investigated by Agent Mulder and myself to date, we have a conviction or case solution of seventy-five percent. That's well above the current bureau standard.
SKINNER: And that is your only saving grace.
SCULLY: May I ask, sir, what more you require?
(Skinner looks away towards the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who looks out the window. Scully looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man as well. Skinner looks back at Scully.)
SKINNER: What I require is increased frequency of reports. Conventional investigation. In short, Agent Scully, it is your responsibility to see that these cases are by-the-book.
SCULLY: I understand, however... conventional investigation of these cases may decrease the rate of success.
(Scully watches as the Cigarette-Smoking Man puts out his cigarette. We hear a gavel pounding.)



SCENE 3
COURT HEARING OF EUGENE VICTOR TOOMS; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
JUDGE KANN: By order of the state of Maryland, the court shall review the psychological status of Eugene Victor Tooms. We'll begin with the court-appointed expert witnesses. The court calls Dr. Pamela Karetzky.
(Eugene Tooms is sitting at a table with a female, obviously his attorney. A board of three judges are seated at a table at the front of the room. Dr. Karetzky gets up and we see Mulder is sitting behind her. He looks at his watch.)
DR. KARETZKY: I performed several diagnostic procedures on Mr. Tooms in order to determine any organic physiological dysfunction - an electroencephalogram, chromosomal analysis, a computerized axial tomograph. All of these were negative.
(Cut to an overlapping picture of another doctor sitting in the chair talking. He is reading off a paper.)
DR. COLLINS: "Mr. Tooms had recently lost his job," Parenthesis: "Baltimore Animal Regulation" slash "Dog Catcher," close parenthesis. "Aggravated by a false arrest incident with the FBI, his assault on Agent Scully was," quote, "frustration directed at the wrong person," end quote.
(Cut to another overlapping picture, this one of Dr. Aaron Monte in the same seat.)
AARON MONTE: I'm reading from a recent interview I did with Mr. Tooms at the Druid Hill Sanitarium. "Question: If you were released, what is the first thing you would do? Answer: I'd like my old job back. Question: Why? Answer: The animal shelter made me feel I was helping everyone, people and animals."
(Mulder leans back in his chair, disgusted. Monte taps his pen in time with the emphasized words.)
So you see, what is occuring here is that Mr. Tooms is learning to articulate his feelings and invest his emotional energy towards creative and constructive activity...
(Tooms looks at Dr. Monte with the yellowish eyes. From Tooms' point of view, the audio fades away and everything becomes black-and-white except for Monte. Monte looks back at Tooms, who looks down. The audio and visual status return to normal.)
...strategem neurotic build-up in himself.
(Tooms looks up, his eyes back to normal.)
It is my opinion that Mr. Tooms has had a very excellent response to the months of treatment and therapy and I would see no reason why he would be considered of any danger to himself or any member of society.
(Mulder takes the stand. He is being sworn in.)
WOMAN: Do you swear that the testimony you are about to deliver is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
MULDER: I do.
(He is seated. The prosecution attorney stands up and walks towards Mulder.)
PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: Mr. Mulder, as an expert witness for the state of Maryland, can you list your qualifications?
MULDER: I'm a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I worked for three years at the F.B.I.'s behavioral science unit profiling serial killers.
DEFENSE COUNSEL NELSON: Your honor, I know where he's going this. May I remind the court that Mr. Tooms was placed in psychiatric care solely for the previous assault on Agent Scully. He has never been charged, nor has any evidence linked him to another crime.
JUDGE KANN: You may proceed... with caution.
(Mulder sees Scully walk in and take a seat in the back.)
PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: Agent Mulder, I understand that you've drawn upon your experience and developed a profile on Mr. Tooms.
MULDER: Yes, I have.
PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: Please.
(He motions for Mulder to show it. Mulder starts a slideshow. The first picture is of a woman, face down.)
MULDER: These murders span nearly a century. Nineteen homicides, five occuring every thirty years since 1903, all in the Baltimore area. In each case, the liver was extracted and presumably eaten.
(The slides cycle through, showing various people lying face down. The judges are disturbed by the pictures. The pictures change to knick-knacks with a tag marked "Evidence" next to them.)
A trophy was taken, many of which were found in the living quarters of Eugene Tooms at 66 Exeter Street. Records show that a Eugene Tooms has resided at that same address since 1903, the same year a man was murdered in that building.
(Scully looks down, knowing the testimony seems incredulous. The judge looks at Mulder warily.)
Besides the liver extraction, the most notable element connecting these cases is the undetermined point of entry. Many of the victims were found with their windows and doors locked from the inside.
(Various fingerprints are shown in the slides.)
These elongated fingerprints found at seven of the nineteen crime sites match Eugene Victor Tooms.
(Mulder motions to Tooms.)
JUDGE KANN: Agent Mulder! Look at his fingers. Look at him! 100 years old?
MULDER: I contend that perhaps through genetic mutation, Eugene Tooms is capable of contorting and elongating his body in order to gain access to victims so that he may extract the livers which provide him with sustenance for the hibernation period of 30 years. He needs one more liver to complete this cycle.
(Everybody finds this testimony incredulous, and slight murmuring can be heard from the back.)
DEFENSE COUNSEL NELSON: Your honor...
MULDER: A preliminary examination done at the time of Tooms' arrest revealed abnormalities in his striated muscles and axial bones. His attorney blocked further study...
PROSECTION COUNSEL MYERS: Thank you, Agent Mulder!
MULDER: I must ask that you place the safety of...
JUDGE KANN: Counsel?
MULDER: ...the people first and foremost...
DEFENSE COUNSEL NELSON: No further questions, your honor.
MULDER: This is a rare and unusual human creature...
JUDGE KANN: Agent Mulder!
MULDER: ...who should not be released, but should be retained for further study.
JUDGE KANN: You may step down!
MULDER: If you release Eugene Tooms, he will kill again. It's in his genetic make-up.
(The judge bangs her gavel. Cut to Mulder, sitting on a bench in the hallway outside the courtroom. Scully walks out and over to Mulder.)
You think they would have taken me more seriously if I wore the grey suit?
(She sits down next to him.)
SCULLY: Mulder, your testimony, you sounded so...
MULDER: I don't care how it sounded as long as it was the truth.
(Scully sighs.)
And where were you? Your testimony was important.
SCULLY: I was called into a meeting by Assistant Director Skinner.
MULDER: What did he want?
SCULLY: Just wanted to reel me in.
(The door opens and Prosecution Council Myers walks out.)
PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: They're ready.
(Back in the courtroom, Tooms and Defense Counsel Nelson are standing. Mulder and Scully sit in the back of the room.)
JUDGE KANN: It is the opinion of this court that Eugene Victor Tooms shall on this daybe released from Druid Hill Sanitarium.
(Tooms smiles. Mulder sighs a heavy breath.)
The court also attaches these conditions. One, that Mr. Tooms remain in counseling under the care of Dr. Aaron Monte; that he retain his job at the Baltimore Regulations Animal Shelter; and last, that he take residence in the house of Mr. and Mrs. Arlan Green...
(Mr. and Mrs. Green stand. Tooms looks back at them.)
... trained in a program to assist patients released from Druid Hill in their transition to society.
(They nod at him.)
Mr. Tooms?
(He looks back at her.)
Do you understand and accept these conditions?
EUGENE TOOMS: Yes, your honor.
(He nods.)
JUDGE KANN: Very well. You're free to go.
(She bangs her gavel again. Mulder and Scully walk out of the courtroom.)
MULDER: I'm not taking my eyes off him.
SCULLY: Mulder, wait...
MULDER: He needs to kill, he'll do it the first chance he can but he won't kill the old couple. He won't be that obvious. Tooms didn't remain a secret for a hundred years by not being careful. Think of him as an animal. He'll only kill out of necessity or self-defense. If he makes an attempt, I'll be there to stop him.
(They stop walking.)
SCULLY: Okay, well then I'll keep surveillance with you.
MULDER: No, I'll watch him. If he can't be tied to the most recent evidence, you'll have to go back to the earlier murders to prove it was him.
SCULLY: That was thirty or sixty years ago.
MULDER: There's no statute of limitation on murder.
SCULLY: Mulder, that's going to entail unorthodox methods of investigation.
MULDER: Look, Scully, if you're resistant because you don't believe, I'll respect that. But if you're resistant because of some bureaucratic pressure, they've not only reeled you in. They've already skinned you.
(Tooms walks out of the courtroom followed by Mr. and Mrs. Green. Tooms slows down a bit as he passes Mulder and Scully and smiles at them. They keep walking, turning the next corner.)
ARLAN GREEN: I hope you'll be comfortable, Eugene. The room in the back is small, but I'm sure you'll be able to squeeze in.
EUGENE TOOMS: I'm sure.



SCENE 4
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(Tooms steps out of his Baltimore Animal Regulation van, walks to the back, takes out a garbage bag, puts on rubber gloves, walks a little down the street, bends over and picks up a rat. He puts the rat in the bag and the bag in the van. He licks the glove where he had touched the rat. He slams the door shut and goes around to the front of the truck again. Before he gets in, he looks over at a woman buying a cappucino at a stand. His breathing becomes heavy and the audio goes out. His eyes turn yellowish. As she starts walking down the street towards him, he starts walking towards her. Everything fades to black-and-white again except for the woman. He growls and his point of view is suddenly interrupted. He looks at the man in front of him and sees it is Agent Mulder. He snarls at him.)
MULDER: Excuse me.
(Tooms' eyes go back to normal.)
Could you help me find my dog?
(Tooms walks back to the car and opens the door.)
He's a Norweigan Elkhound. His name is Heinrich. I use him to hunt moose.
(Tooms gets in and drives away. Mulder watches him drive by.)



SCENE 5
LYNNE ACRES RETIREMENT HOME; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(Detective Frank Briggs looks at a newspaper clipping with the headline "Suspect Caught in Serial Killings." Under the title is a picture of Tooms. Briggs crumples up the paper and throws it down. He rubs his forehead and sighs. Scully is standing.)
FRANK BRIGGS: If Tooms gets away now then the next time he takes a life, you'll be nearly my age.
SCULLY: Detective Briggs, you've helped us so much before. Now we have to prove that Tooms was involved in the killings you investigated thirty years ago. You've lived with this case half your life.
(She walks towards him and sits down.)
There must be something. Maybe a connection between the victims. Now, I know that we've seen all the evidence, but is there anything, anything at all amongst the evidence that doesn't fit?
FRANK BRIGGS: There was something that never did sit quite right with me. All of the victims that I investigated in '63 were found at the crime scene, liver extracted. All five.
SCULLY: As were the four most recent murders.
(Briggs wheels himself over to the bed with a box on it.)
FRANK BRIGGS: When I was a sherrif during the Powhatan Mill killings of 1933, only four of the victims were found at the crime scene. However, there was a fifth person who was missing and never found.
(Scully walks over to him. He takes out a piece of liver in a jar marked "Evidence.")
But this, this was discovered at the Ruxton Chemical Plant when it was under construction.
(He hands the jar to her. She sits down.)
But it doesn't belong to the other victims.
SCULLY: That doesn't prove that it belongs to a person murdered by Tooms.
FRANK BRIGGS: I'm positive that Tooms hid this one victim because there was something about the body that could prove he was the killer.
SCULLY: And what makes you positive?
FRANK BRIGGS: A hunch. A good old-fashioned hunch. You've got to trust your instincts.
SCULLY: And what does your instincts say about where Tooms buried the body?
FRANK BRIGGS: In the cement where they poured the foundation of the chemical plant.



SCENE 6
RUXTON CHEMICAL PLANT; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(A man with some sort of scanner moves the machine along the foundation as a read-out is being printed from the machine. The rock inside the foundation is shown on a screen. Scully and Briggs are behind a man who is watching the screen and making notes on the print-out.)
SCULLY: Ground-penetrating radar. It bounces signals off of objects or cavities.
FRANK BRIGGS: Tells you where the body is.
SCULLY: Well, it signals if something inordinate is present. An experienced operator attempts to differentiate if the signal is a body or is stone or a hole in the ground.
FRANK BRIGGS: Differentiate?
SCULLY: Mm-hmmm.
FRANK BRIGGS: You mean he guesses?
SCULLY: Well, it's an educated guess.
FRANK BRIGGS: Mm-hmmm.
(Scully walks over to the man at the machine.)
SCULLY: How are we doing?
OPERATOR: Well, it's really hard to tell. There are some possibilities... very few places...
(The sound of the man's voice trails off as Briggs wheels around some pipes and columns. He stops at a piece of the ground.)
FRANK BRIGGS: It's here. Here!
(He points at the ground as Scully and a few men run around the corner.)
MAN: What is it?
FRANK BRIGGS: It's here. It's right here!



SCENE 7
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(Tooms puts an unidentifyable roadkill of some sort into another garbage bag. As he stands up, a man in a blue trenchcoat walks by. Tooms turns to look at him. He gets in the back of the van and watches the man get in his car. His eyes turn yellow and the noises of the crowd fade away. Everything fades to black-and-white but the man. Tooms slams the door shut and watches him through the glass.)



SCENE 8
RUXTON CHEMICAL PLANT; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(A man with a jackhammer digs through the foundation at the part Briggs pointed out. Scully, Briggs, and various men watch. They all have protective earpieces and safety goggles. He stops and another man bends down with an air hose, blowing away the loose dirt.)
AIR HOSE MAN: Agent Scully? Look at this.
(Scully takes off her earpieces and goes over to the spot. Scully bends down and pushes away the dirt with a brush. Briggs goes over as well. Looking closely, Scully sees that there are three bone fingers, one with a silver ring on it.)



SCENE 9
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(The man in the blue trenchcoat pulls up in his car at a house. Tooms pulls up in his van, followed by Mulder in his car. Inside the house, the man, Frank Ranford, is in a sweatshirt looking at data charts on his computer. His wife, Christine, is standing next to him.)
CHRISTINE RANFORD: Robotoddler's finally asleep. I'm going to go to bed.
FRANK RANFORD: Okay.
(She walks out of the room. Outside, we hear a dog barking. Mulder is sleeping, but a passing car wakes him up. He looks at his watch and gets out of the car. He goes to the Baltimore Animal Regulation van and shines his flashlight in the front seat. He goes to the back of the van, opens the door, and shines his flashlight in. He looks out and runs off to the house. Under the van, we see the manhole cover close. Inside the bathroom, Christine Ranford fixes her hair. She blows her nose and goes over to the toilet. Looking in, she sees the water is green and bubbling. Mulder skulks around outside. In the bathroom, Christine tries to unclog the toilet. The toilet flushes and the baby starts crying.)
CHRISTINE RANFORD: I'm coming, honey. Mommy's right here. Shh, shh.
(She goes out of the bathroom. The wire on the tool she was using starts being pulled down the toilet drain. Frank is still typing on his keyboard. Christine comes in wearing gloves.)
Screw it.
(She goes to pull out the wire but it is pulled back in. She yanks it again, pulling it out this time. She starts to walk out, but turns around, puts the lid down and latches the child-proof lock. We see Mulder searching outside and Frank writing something down. Tooms skulks around to the side of the house. His fingers slide under the small hole between the window and the windowledge. He pulls open the window. As Frank continues typing, Tooms, covered with sludge, puts his foot through the iron bars on the window and steps on the desk. He struggles to pull himself through. He gets through, growls, and moves off towards his prey. Frank pulls a paper out of a desk drawer as yellow eyes watch him. The area around Frank grows black-and-white, and all we can hear is heavy breathing. Frank sits down at his computer. Mulder spots marks, hand prints, on the windowsill. He hurries off towards the house and knocks on the door. Christine calls to her husband.)
Would you go down and get that?
(Frank sighs and closes the door behind him. He goes down and moves the curtain away, looking through the door. Mulder is standing there, holding his badge.)
MULDER: F.B.I.
(Frank opens the door.)
I suspect an intruder in your house.
FRANK RANFORD: What?
(Mulder walks into the room, followed by Christine and Frank. Frank points at the open window.)
Someone opened my window.
(Mulder walks over to the window and shines his flashlight outside. He looks down at the windowsill and sees the same handprints as before, this time from the inside. He rushes out the front door and sees that the van has gone, the manhole that was under it releasing steam.)



SCENE 10
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE; FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY LAB
(Doctor Collins and Scully walk in and over to the block of cement containing the skeleton, which was apparently dug up.)
DR. PLITH: I suspect the year of death to be in the mid-1930’s. The anterior surface of the right femur was green indicating a long-term exposure to copper. So we concentrated on the area and we found several pennies.
(They walk over to his desk, where he picks up a few pennies and shows them to Scully.)
1933, ’31, 1933...
SCULLY: Can you determine the cause of death? My instinct says that burial in cement is murder.
DR. PLITH: Ah, no. At the moment, I have found no definite proof of murder. There are gnawing marks near the ribs, however, I suspect that’s the result of rodent activity prior to the body being set in cement. We’ll need to see much more of the remains to determine cause of death. As you know, it’s a slow but necessary process. Uh, I did try a little something. It’s a little premature if we’re going to go by-the-book.
SCULLY: Well, we’ll keep it off the record.
DR. PLITH: Good, thank you.
(He walks over to a computer. Scully follows.)
The old man, Briggs, he gave me a photograph of the missing person in 1933 suspected of being a murder victim. I ran a computer-assisted photographic superimposition on what we have of the skull.
(He holds up a picture of a man with glasses.)
Now, this is not official... but that skeleton was that person.
(He holds up a picture, half of which is the skull, half of which is the man. The basic structures seem to match.)



SCENE 11
MULDER’S CAR
(Mulder is looking at the picture. He is in the driver’s seat, Scully’s in the passenger seat.)
MULDER: It’s not enough. It doesn’t tie it to Tooms.
SCULLY: Well, it’s a start.
(Mulder nods. Scully looks at the various take-out food trays.)
Mulder, it’s getting a bit ripe in here, don’t you think?
(Mulder reaches over into the glove compartment, pulls out an air freshener, and tears off the wrapper. He holds it up.)
MULDER: Pine-scented.
(He smells it, then puts it in front of Scully’s nose.)
SCULLY: Ooh!
(He hangs it on the rear-view mirror. He sniffs the air.)
MULDER: Better?
(He exhales. Scully looks at him, a slight smile.)
Tooms hasn’t come out of the house all day. I sat through a Phillies game, an Orioles game, and four hours of Ba-Ba-Booey. When it got dark, I took a walk around the block. Do you have that sandwich that I asked you to bring?
(Scully digs through a paper bag and pulls out a sandwich.)
SCULLY: It’s liverwurst.
MULDER: Ha-ha.
(He opens up the wrapper.)
SCULLY: Mulder, you know that proper surveillance requires two pairs of agents, one pair relieving the other after twelve hours.
MULDER: Article 30, paragraph 8.7?
SCULLY: This isn’t about doing it by the book. This is about you not having slept for three days. Mulder, you’re going to get sloppy and you’re going to get hurt. It’s inevitable at this point.
MULDER: A request for other agents to stake-out Tooms would be denied. Then we have no grounds.
SCULLY: Well, then I’ll stay here. You go home.
(Mulder sighs.)
MULDER: They’re out to put an end to the X-Files, Scully. I don’t know why, but any excuse will do. Now, I don’t really care about my record, but you’d be in trouble just for sitting in this car and I’d hate to see you to carry an official reprimand in your file because of me.
(Scully sighs.)
SCULLY: Fox...
(Mulder laughs. Scully looks at him.)
MULDER: And I... I even made my parents call me Mulder. So... Mulder.
SCULLY: Mulder, I wouldn’t put myself on the line for anybody but you.
(They look at each other.)
MULDER: If there’s an ice tea in that bag, could be love.
(She takes out the drink.)
SCULLY: Must be fate, Mulder. Root beer.
(Mulder kiddingly sighs.)
You’re delirious. Go home and get some sleep.
(Mulder hands her the sandwich.)
MULDER: Here. Take my sandwich, I only had one bite. You’re gonna want it later, believe me. And you’ll call me if anything happens, immediately. I’ll be here.
(She starts to get out of the car.)
Oh, and 11:30, station 790, Pete Rose Late Night Sports Talk Radio Show.
(He nods grinning. Scully, grinning in a half-doubting-his-sanity sort of way, gets out of the car and walks away. We hear a dog barking.)
SCULLY: Wouldn’t miss it for the world.
(Mulder starts the car. We see the trunk latch shut before he drives away. Scully gets in the car and looks at the sandwich.)



SCENE 12
MULDER’S APARTMENT
(Mulder is asleep on the couch. The original movie version of "The Fly" is on the TV. In it, David Hedison's character Andre Delambre walks out of his chamber with a black cloth over his head.)
NURSE ON TV: It has worked, hasn’t it? You’ll be all right now. I know it worked!
(She pulls the black hood off Delambre’s head to reveal a fly’s head. She screams as dramatic music plays. Mulder sleeps soundly through it all. A screw on the air vent loosens, squeaking.)
No! No! Nooo!!!!
(The screw falls to the floor. The next one starts turning and squeaking. Mulder wakes up and the screw stops turning. He goes back to sleep and the screw falls out. Tooms steps in and looks at Mulder, yellow eyes blazing. He puts his finger to his face and pushes in. Blood pours down his face. He drags the blood down his cheek with his finger. He groans.)



SCENE 13
HOSPITAL; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(Tooms is sitting on an examination table. Detective Talbot takes down notes as Doctor Richmond looks at him.)
DETECTIVE TALBOT: Yeah, they found him out cold in the street.
DR. RICHMOND: He’s been beaten up pretty badly. Contusions, multiple lacerations. Shoulder’s been pulled right out of joint. Let’s get him prepped for some blood work and X-rays.
MALE NURSE: Yes, doctor.
(She looks at his face. We see Tooms’ face now, bloodied in various places. A shoeprint is on his face.)
DR. RICHMOND: He’s been kicked in the jaw and it may be fractured. Look, there’s a partial shoeprint.
DETECTIVE TALBOT: I want to get a photo of that, we might be able to find the shoe that matches it later.
DR. RICHMOND: Do you know who did this to you?
(Tooms mouths some words. The doctor leans in and Tooms is barely audible, so much that he cannot be understood.)
We’ll be right back, Mr. Tooms.
(She goes to the back room with Talbot.)
Says it’s an F.B.I. agent named Mulder.
DETECTIVE TALBOT: So would you say he’s delusional or just schizophrenic?
DR. RICHMOND: Well, it’s just a cursory exam, but there’s nothing to indicate that.
(Tooms snaps his shoulder back into place with a resounding pop. He smiles slightly.)



SCENE 14
MULDER’S APARTMENT
(Mulder is awakened by a knock on the door. He gets up and opens it. Talbot shows him his badge.)
DETECTIVE TALBOT: Agent Mulder?
MULDER: Yeah.
(Talbot comes in followed by a police officer. Talbot motions for the officer to check out the back room where the couch is.)
What’s going on?
(Mulder follows the officer and sees him kneel over and pick up a pair of Mulder’s sneakers.)
What’s this about?
DETECTIVE TALBOT: Agent Mulder, get your things. You’re in some trouble.
(The officer and Talbot start out the door. Mulder starts to follow when he steps on something metallic, hearing a click. He bends down and picks up the screw from the air vent. He looks at the vent and sees it is missing a screw.)



SCENE 15
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Skinner walks from the door to his desk, around Mulder and Scully, both are seated. The Cigarette-Smoking Man is seated off to the side.)
SKINNER: These are serious allegations, Agent Mulder, the evidence is incriminating.
MULDER: A good forensic scientist would know that there is not only a shoe print but also an impact point from inside the shoe. An indepth analysis of Tooms’ injury would show that my foot was not inside the shoe at the time of impact.
SKINNER: Mulder, are you suggesting that Tooms is framing you?
MULDER: Of course.
SKINNER: If indeed you were engaged in an unauthorized round-the-clock surviellance of Tooms, how could he possibly gain access to your shoe without you seeing him?
(Mulder goes to speak, but Scully cuts him off.)
SCULLY: Sir? I was engaged in the unauthorized surveillance as well and Agent Mulder was orienting me on the situation at the time Tooms was admitted into the hospital. Agent Mulder could not have done it because he was with me.
SKINNER: Agent Scully, you wouldn’t be lying in me, would you?
SCULLY: Sir, I would expect you to place the same trust in me as I do in you.
SKINNER: Agent Scully, may I have a word with Agent Mulder, please?
(Scully looks at Mulder, sighs, and leaves. The Cigarette-Smoking Man lights a cigarette. Skinner gets up, takes off his glasses and walks around to Mulder.)
Fox, you are one of the finest, most unique agents in the nearly sixty-year history of this institution.
(He sits down where Scully was sitting.)
I mean, we were talking about you when you were in the academy. Now, most of us, including the director, feel that your talents are wasted on the X-Files but we respect that you’re deeply invested in those areas. But if these areas are creating such stress as to not only cause you to act inappropriately but those agents close to you as well then may I advise you to step away... for a while. Clear your head, take an extended vacation.
MULDER: That’s a good idea. Thanks for your concern.
(Skinner looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who takes a drag. He gets up, sighs, goes back around his desk and puts on his glasses.)
SKINNER: You’re forbidden to go near Eugene Tooms.
(Mulder gets up and goes to the door.)
Mulder...
(Mulder stops. The Cigarette-Smoking Man crosses to Skinner.)
This was close. Any closer and a thousand friends at the capitol won’t be able to help you.



SCENE 16
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE; FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY LAB
(Mulder is looking at an x-ray of Tooms’ dental x-rays.)
SCULLY: These are Eugene Tooms’ dental x-rays obtained from the Druid Hill Sanitarium. Your sandwich the other night gave me an idea. Dr. Plith had mentioned that he found gnawing on the rib cage near the location of the liver.
(They walk over to the skeleton in cement.)
Further excavation revealed more pronounced bite marks, human teeth marks.
MULDER: Tooms will never voluntarily submit to a dental cast.
(Scully walks over to Dr. Plith, who is seated at the computer, and sits down. Mulder follows.)
SCULLY: This software can create an exact three-dimensional model of Tooms’ mouth from the dental radiograph.
(A three-dimensional image appears of Tooms’ mouth on the computer, followed by a 3-D image of the bitten rib.)
DR. PLITH: We’ve also mapped out the bite marks on the skeleton’s rib... there.
(He points out the bite marks on the image. He presses a few buttons and the jaws appear above and below the bone. The areas around the bites and teeth blink green.)
They match.



SCENE 17
THE GREEN HOUSE; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(Tooms is tearing up newspaper at his desk to make his nest when there is a knocking at the door. Arlan Green comes in followed by Dr. Monte.)
ARLAN GREEN: Eugene, Doctor Monte.
AARON MONTE: Hi, Eugene. I just wanted to stop by and see how everything was going.
ARLAN GREEN: Susan and I are going out for the evening. See you later.
(He shakes Monte’s hand.)
AARON MONTE: Thanks.
(Green leaves.)
Great place. Wonderful place. How are you feeling?
(Tooms’ breathing becomes erratic. The color fades out of the room and Monte is no longer audible. Monte sits on the bed. Suddenly, it all goes back to normal.)
Why the newspaper strips, Eugene? Are you making some paper-mache?
EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.
AARON MONTE: That’s terrific. Wonderful, I had no idea you were interested in art.
(Tooms stands.)
EUGENE TOOMS: I like art.
AARON MONTE: I do too and I’m very proud of you.
(Tooms goes to the door and his eyes turn yellow.)
You know, art can provide a window to your thoughts and your feelings...what are you doing, Eugene?
(Tooms closes the door.)
Eugene? Are you alright?
(We hear a short scream, a bang, and a long scream. Obviously, Monte is the one screaming. Mulder and Scully pull up to the house. They get out and Mulder knocks on the door. Mulder opens the door and they go inside. They go into Tooms’ room. Mulder tries the light switch, but it does not work. He takes out his flashlight. We see a bloody hand laying across the top of a chair.)
MULDER: That makes five.
(He walks over to the desk and picks up a piece of bloody newspaper.)
He’s building his nest. Thirty year hibernation.
SCULLY: Where would he go?
MULDER: Where he’s gone for the last ninty years, 66 Exeter Street.
SCULLY: No, I already checked on that. They tore down that apartment building he lived in.
MULDER: What’s there now?



SCENE 18
66 EXETER STREET; BALTIMORE
(A giant shopping mall with the words "City Square" is in place of the run-down apartment building. A security guard unlocks the door for Mulder and Scully.)
MULDER: Thanks.
(They walk through, both carrying flashlights.)
He’s got to be here.
SCULLY: If he is drawn to this location for some reason, maybe this nest is in the approximate location of his previous nest.
(They stop.)
This is the area. There’s a storage facility on the second floor.
(Mulder starts up the escalator but stops and turns around, shining the light at Scully.)
What?
(Mulder shines the light down at the door leading to under the escalator for utility purposes. They open up the door.)
There’s only room for one.
(Scully starts to take off her trenchcoat, but Mulder stops her.)
MULDER: You can get the next mutant.
(Mulder takes off his coat and tie, unbuttons the top of his shirt, puts his gun in the holster and, flashlight in hand, climbs down into the crawlspace. He shines the flashlight down on the floor and sees some traces of bile. He takes out his gun and starts crawling through the passage. He shakes off a grate and continues on his way. Down the passageway, we can barely make out the same kind of nest that he previously had: a yellowish paper construct.)
SCULLY: (off in distance) Mulder?
(Scully shines her flashlight down into the hole, trying to see Mulder. Mulder shuffles through left-over newspaper and comes right up to the nest. Mulder inspects the nest closer and sees a tiny hole with bile dripping off of it. Suddenly, a hand bursts through and grabs Mulder’s shoulder. Mulder drops the gun as he starts to be pushed into the nest. He breaks free and Tooms tears through the rest of the hole, naked, covered in bile, yellow eyes, growling.)
(off in distance) Mulder!
(He charges at Mulder but is smashed in the face by the flashlight. A quick backhand with the flashlight sends Tooms down. Mulder shimmies down the vent, closely followed by Tooms. Mulder comes to the opening and Scully offers her hand to pull him up.)
Mulder! Mulder, here! Quick, grab my hand! Come on! Just a little...
(Before he can do so, Tooms, growling, grabs his ankle and pulls him back into the hole. Mulder struggles to not get pulled in. He kicks Tooms in the face and grabs Scully’s hand. Scully pulls him up as Tooms struggles to get out. Mulder jumps forward and presses a button, turning the elevator on. Tooms screams and is dragged under. Blood rolls up on the stairs. Mulder and Scully watch as they recover from their ordeal.)



SCENE 19
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Skinner looks at the file for Tooms. A picture and fingerprints are on a paper. He closes the file, which reads on the cover:
"Federal Bureau
Of
Investigation
Bureau file number: X 129202
Eugene Victor Tooms - Closed")
SKINNER: You read this report?
(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks towards the window. Skinner looks at him.)
Do you believe them?
CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Of course I do.



SCENE 20
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
(Mulder is looking at a caterpillar cocoon hanging off a branch. Scully walks up next to him.)
SCULLY: Okay, let’s go.
MULDER: It’s amazing how things change, isn’t it?
(Scully looks at the cocoon.)
SCULLY: The caterpillar?
MULDER: No, a change for us. It’s coming.
SCULLY: How do you know?
MULDER: A hunch.
(He walks away. Scully looks at the caterpillar, turns and follows.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
14TH PRECINCT HOUSE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK
(A car pulls up in front of the precinct house, and two detectives enter the building. One of them, Detective Rudy Barbala, greets Detective Sharon Lazard, who is at her desk.)

DET. BARBALA: What ho.

DET. LAZARD: What ho.

DET. BARBALA: Hey, Lazard. Now why do the night guys get a piece like you when we're stuck with old eel breath?

DET. LAZARD: It's fate, Detective, conspiring to keep us apart. All right, I'm outta here. (to Barbala) See ya. (to another co-worker) Tomorrow.

(She leaves the building and walks down the street. In an alley, she sees a little girl sitting alone near some trash bags. She enters the alley and walks toward the little girl.)

DET. LAZARD: You all right? You lost?

(The little girl doesn't respond at first, then nods.)

(Lazard and Barbala are walking through the station house.)

DET. LAZARD: Anyway, I got her in the holding room. She's not talking, she won't say a word ... at least not to me.

DET. BARBALA: (smiling) And you're asking me because you know how good I am with kids, right?

DET. LAZARD: (also smiling) Yeah, a regular Mr. Greenjeans.

(They enter the holding room, where the little girl, Michelle Bishop, is sitting at a table facing the window.)

DET. LAZARD: Hi. This is Detective Barbala. He's gonna help you find your parents.

DET. BARBALA: Hi ya sweetheart. What's your name?

MICHELLE: Michelle.

DET. LAZARD: Everything's gonna be all right. OK? Don't be scared now.

(Lazard leaves the room, closing the door behind her. Barbala moves around the table and sits facing Michelle, his back to the window.)

DET. BARBALA: Michelle what? (she stares at him but doesn't respond at first) Well, you said your first name was Michelle, now what's your last name?

MICHELLE: Bishop.

DET. BARBALA: (writing on his note pad) Bishop. Michelle Bishop. And where do you live, Michelle? Here in Buffalo?

(She stares at him again. Moments later, we see something crashing through the window. A loud crash is heard in the precinct house.)

VARIOUS IN PRECINCT HOUSE: What was that? Did you hear that?

(Lazard runs back to the holding room and enters. She sees the broken window and approaches it.)

MAN FROM STREET BELOW: Somebody call an ambulance!

(She looks out the window and sees a body lying on the roof of a car below. She turns to look at the little girl, who stares back at her.)





SCENE 2
(Outside the station house, news crews and police cars surround the scene. Inside, Lazard talks with Mulder and Scully.)

MULDER: How'd you hear about us?

DET. LAZARD: My brother. My, uh, my brother's a cop. Baltimore. He told me about your work on the Tooms case, said you gotta good feel for things out of the ordinary. (Mulder and Scully exchange a brief glance) Look, the truth is Barbala never won any popularity contests here at the one-four, but he's, he's still a cop, you know. I guess that's why I can't just let this rest.

SCULLY: You said there was one witness, a little girl. What did she say happened?

DET. LAZARD: She said there was another man in the room.

SCULLY: Well, it stands to reason that somebody ...

DET. LAZARD: I was right outside. I'm telling you, there was nobody else there except for Barbala and the kid.

(They start walking through the station house.)

MULDER: So you didn't get a description of who the kid saw?

DET. LAZARD: I'm telling you, there was no one else. Listen. The department is treating this as a suicide, but I gotta tell you. I knew this guy. There's no way he did himself.

SCULLY: Was he depressed or under psychiatric care of any kind?

DET. LAZARD: No. Only time he ever looked at himself was in the mirror. And he always liked what he saw.

(They've reached the holding room. Mulder walks toward the window.)

MULDER: Plus jumpers tend to open the window before they jump. Where's the kid now?

DET. LAZARD: She was released about an hour ago. Her mother came to pick her up.

SCULLY: You don't really think the girl had anything to do with it, do you?

DET. LAZARD: I don't know what to believe any more. You know, eight years I've been on this force, I've seen a lot of strange things. But I'm telling you ... this kid ... something's just not right about her.

(At the Bishop residence, Michelle is sitting next to Harry Linhart, an FBI technician. He is developing a sketch on a computer based on her description. Mulder stands behind them.)

LINHART: Did he have long hair or short hair?

MICHELLE: Short.

(Linhart hits a key, and the face on the computer fills in short hair.)

MULDER: Like that? (she nods) Was his hair dark like mine or lighter like yours?

MICHELLE: Like mine.

(Linhart types some more and the hair color lightens.)

LINHART: What about a beard or a moustache?

MICHELLE: Moustache.

(Mulder whispers something in Linhart's ear and he nods.)

LINHART: Like this? (a very long, pointed moustache appears on the screen; Michelle smiles) Or this?

(The moustache curls at the ends into a handlebar moustache. Michelle laughs. Suddenly the computer monitor flashes and the screen shows a man with a normal mustache.)

LINHART: Whoa! What happened? Weird. I didn't even hit a key. Must be a glitch in the new software.

MULDER: Michelle? Was his mustache like that? (she nods)

(Meanwhile, Scully and Mrs. Bishop are talking in the living room.)

SCULLY: Do you have any idea how your daughter might have gotten there? Buffalo's half an hour away by train and the station is a five minute car ride.

MRS. BISHOP: When I came home, Mrs. Dougherty was locked in the wine cellar. I called the police immediately.

SCULLY: And Mrs. Dougherty is?

MRS. BISHOP: Michelle's nanny. The latest, that is. She's already gone through four this year, and it's only April.

SCULLY: What seems to be the problem?

MRS. BISHOP: Michelle is the problem.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

MRS. BISHOP: As hard as it is for a mother to admit ... Michelle is a disturbed child. Oh, I know this sounds terrible to say, but the truth is that sometimes she frightens me.

SCULLY: Frightens you how?

MRS. BISHOP: She's not like other girls, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Tell me.

MRS. BISHOP: She just isn't. She doesn't have any friends. She hardly ever smiles. It breaks my heart that I can't comfort her. She says she sees things that I can't see. She hears people yelling in her head.

(They've stepped outside and are walking next to a covered swimming pool.)

MRS. BISHOP: Last summer we had to cover our pool. Jim was trying to teach her how to swim, but every time that Michelle would get close to the water, she would just start to scream - scream like you've never heard in all your life.

SCULLY: Your husband? Where is he now?

MRS. BISHOP: We're divorced.

(Mulder comes out of the house carrying the finished sketch.)

MULDER: Mrs. Bishop?

MRS. BISHOP: Um-hmm.

MULDER: (showing her the sketch) This is the man Michelle says she saw at the police station. Do you recognize him?

MRS. BISHOP: No, I'm sorry.

MULDER: She also mentioned a friend ... someone named Sheila. Do you know who that is?

MRS. BISHOP: That would be Dr. Braun. She's the developmental psychologist over at Brylin Hospital. Michelle sees her twice a week.

(Mulder looks up to see Michelle looking at them from an upstairs window. She tosses something out and it flutters to the ground next to them. Mulder picks it up - blue paper folded in the shape of a bird.)

MULDER: Look at that? Looks like a hawk or a falcon.

SCULLY: It's beautiful.

MRS. BISHOP: It's called origami.

MULDER: Japanese paper folding. Where'd she learn how to do that?

MRS. BISHOP: I have no idea.

(Out front, Linhart has his computer equipment in the back of a car. He feeds the sketch into a fax machine as Mulder and Scully approach.)

MULDER: So Harry, you'll put that face into the system?

LINHART: As we speak.

MULDER: Can you give Scully a ride back into the city?

SCULLY: Wait a minute. We have an autopsy at 7.

MULDER: That's your department. I'm gonna go over to Brylin Hospital, see if I can have a little chat with Michelle's shrink.

(He starts away but stops and turns back to her.)

MULDER: Oh, oh, and check for burns or lesions on Barbala's body.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: Psychokinesis is usually associated with an electrical charge.

SCULLY: Are you saying Michelle possesses the ability to psychically project her own will?

MULDER: How else could a 60-pound kid throw a 200-pound detective out the window?




SCENE 3
BRYLIN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL,
BUFFALO, NEW YORK
(Mulder talks to Dr. Sheila Braun in her office.)

DR. BRAUN: (handing the sketch back to him) Nope. I don't recognize him. I have no idea who this man is.

MULDER: Could Michelle have fabricated him?

DR. BRAUN: Quite possibly. As with many dissociative disorders, the intensity of the patient's emotions is often too much for one personality to process. So in defense, part of the personality splits itself off.

MULDER: As in schizophrenia?

DR. BRAUN: I'm afraid Michelle's diagnosis is not quite that simple. You see, my primary challenge has been to discover the source of her extreme rage. In most cases, it's a traumatic event in the patient's past.

MULDER: And in Michelle's case?

DR. BRAUN: (sighs and steps to a cabinet next to her desk) Occasionally, I would leave Michelle alone for part of our session - with this doll. (opens the cabinet, which has several identical dolls on a shelf) Each time a new doll, anatomically intact. (she hands one to Mulder) And each time, she dismembers and disfigures it in exactly the same way. (the doll is missing an arm and an eye) First I thought she was being abused, but after a number of sessions with her parents, I became convinced that there was something else behind Michelle's anxiety. Something much deeper, much more elusive.

MULDER: Any theories?

DR. BRAUN: Frankly, no. I'm at a loss.

MULDER: Have you tried deep regression hypnosis?

DR. BRAUN: I've found hypnosis an unreliable approach at best.

MULDER: OK. Well, in the meantime, how have you been treating Michelle?

DR. BRAUN: Well, the thorazine has been quite effective in regulating her more bizarre behavior.

MULDER: I'm sure. Have you observed any unexplained phenomena in Michelle's presence?

DR. BRAUN: Unexplained phenomena?

MULDER: Inordinate physical strength, psychic ability, telekinesis...

DR. BRAUN: You're joking, of course.

(He shakes his head. She looks at her watch.)

DR. BRAUN: I have a patient waiting, Agent Mulder. If you'll excuse me.

(Scully is performing an autopsy on Barbala. A photographer works with her.)

SCULLY: Note postmortem examination is being conducted 11 hours and 45 minutes after subject was pronounced. (she sees a large red area on the body's lower chest) Note raised lesion approximately 7 centimeters below sternum. Deep necrosis inconsistent with cause of death as pronounced by Dr. Gilder, and suggests localized electrocution ... but a further tissue analysis will be necessary.

(Lazard sticks her head through the door, looking none too eager to come any further into the room.)

DET. LAZARD: Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a second?

SCULLY: I just started the autopsy.

DET. LAZARD: Yeah. Um, I don't think he's going anywhere.

SCULLY: (to photographer) Will you, uh, take a couple for scale, please. Thank you. I'll be right back.

(She steps out to speak with Lazard, who hands her the sketch along with a photograph of a man.)

DET. LAZARD: So what do you think?

SCULLY: Looks like a match.

DET. LAZARD: Yeah. Name's Charlie Morris. Officer Charlie Morris. Used to work narcotics out at the two-seven.

SCULLY: Do you know him?

DET. LAZARD: No. Before my time.

SCULLY: Where is he now? Has he been transferred?

DET. LAZARD: You could say that. Agent Scully, this guy's been dead for nine years. Which means that little girl saw ... a ghost.




SCENE 4
14TH PRECINCT HOUSE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK
(Scully enters with a case file and walks toward Mulder, who is looking at Charlie Morris' photograph.)

SCULLY: He was killed in Chinatown - gangland style, allegedly by the Triads, although no arrests were ever made. Now Mulder, if you're gonna tell me that you think Michelle Bishop saw a poltergeist ...

MULDER: Hey, you're the one that found a lesion on Barbala's body. You said it could have been caused by an intense concentration of electrothermal energy.

SCULLY: "Could have been" being the operative phrase. Now, I'm not going to know for sure until the lab results are in, and even then ...

MULDER: Why is it still so hard for you to believe, even when all the evidence suggests extraordinary phenomena?

SCULLY: Because sometimes ...

(She starts walking across the room. Mulder follows.)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: ... looking for extreme possibilities makes you blind to the probable explanation right in front of you.

(She has walked to a trophy case along the wall near the holding room. In it is a plaque with Charlie Morris' picture on it.)

SCULLY: This is the face that Michelle Bishop saw. She walked right by here and she saw the face of Charlie Morris ... which means that there weren't any ghosts flying around the precinct.

MULDER: You have the police report describing Morris' death?

SCULLY: Yeah, I have what's been declassified. Why?

MULDER: Does it describe how he was murdered?

SCULLY: Yes, I told you. It was a signature hit.

MULDER: Give me the grisly details.

SCULLY: His arm was severed just below the shoulder, presumably by a chainsaw, and his right eye was gouged out.

(Mulder walks to his briefcase and pulls out the doll that Dr. Braun showed him.)

MULDER: This is what Michelle did to a dozen dolls in her shrink's office. Hell of a coincidence, wouldn't you say? Now before we discount anything, I think we should find out more about Charlie Morris. I got the address of his partner on the force. Hopefully, he can tell us something.




SCENE 5
FIORE RESIDENCE, KENMORE, NEW YORK
(Mulder and Scully drive up, then knock on the front door. A man answers.)

MULDER: Detective Fiore? We're with the FBI. Can we talk to you for a minute? Do you know this man?

(The man closes the door, unlatches the chain, and comes out onto the porch, closing the door behind him.)

DET. FIORE: You mind if we do this out here? Uh, I don't want to wake my wife.

SCULLY: Yeah, this won't take long.

DET. FIORE: Yeah, sure I know him. That's, uh, Charlie. Charlie Morris.

MULDER: You two were partners?

DET. FIORE: Yeah, we rode together his first nine months out of the academy.

MULDER: What can you tell us about the circumstances surrounding his death?

(Fiore looks back toward the house, then moves farther from the door, toward the end of the porch.)

DET. FIORE: That matter is still under investigation and so I can't comment on it.

SCULLY: Detective, we're under the direct authority of Captain Gershom at the 14th precinct.

DET. FIORE: 14th precinct? I never worked out of the one-four. What's all this about?

MULDER: Well, we believe that the death of Detective Rudy Barbala yesterday can be linked to the death of Officer Morris nine years ago.

DET. FIORE: Linked how? I thought this Barbala flipped his wig and jumped out of a window.

SCULLY: Did you know the detective?

DET. FIORE: By reputation. Look, what's all this got to do with Charlie?

MULDER: Well, that's what we need your help with. The police report said that Officer Morris was killed off-duty.

DET. FIORE: That's right. Best we can figure, it was some kind of payback.

MULDER: For what?

DET. FIORE: Well, around that time, the organized crime division was doing a major sweep in Chinatown.

MULDER: The Triads.

DET. FIORE: Yeah. Some very heavy busts went down against the Woo Shing Woo. A lot of smack never made it to the street. You can bet there were some pretty pissed off people playing Mah-Jongg that week.

MULDER: So you think that Charlie Morris was killed as a warning to back off?

DET. FIORE: I think they picked a cop - any cop - and they whacked him.

MRS. FIORE: (stepping out the front door) Who is it, Tony?

DET. FIORE: Oh, it's nothing to worry about, honey. Just some people from the FBI asking about a case I'm working.

SCULLY: Sir, would you mind ...

DET. FIORE: Hey, it's the weekend. You guys mind? You can get me at the squad, first thing Monday morning, OK?

SCULLY: Sure.

DET. FIORE: Good luck.

(He closes the door. Mulder and Scully walk down the steps and sidewalk toward their car.)

MULDER: Is it me or did we just get the brush-off?

SCULLY: Did you notice her hands?

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: He said she was sleeping, but her hands were dusted with baking flour.




SCENE 6
BUFFALO MUTUAL LIFE, MAIN OFFICE,
BUFFALO, NEW YORK
(Detective Fiore is pacing the floor, talking nervously with another man, Felder.)

FELDER: Not a big deal, all right? Don't jerk yourself around Tony. You're acting like a little bug.

DET. FIORE: They were FBI.

FELDER: So what?

DET. FIORE: They start sniffing around too much, they're gonna turn something up.

FELDER: Relax. They're just people like us, going through the motions.

DET. FIORE: Oh, yeah? Then how are they connecting Charlie to Barbala?

FELDER: And what do they know? Huh? Nothing.

DET. FIORE: Come on. We're going to Citibank right now.

FELDER: For what?

DET. FIORE: The safety box.

FELDER: And what should we do, Tony? Huh? Make a donation to the Little Sisters for the Poor?

DET. FIORE: Dump it somewhere.

FELDER: Tony. There's only two of us left now. That's over a million each.

DET. FIORE: Take it all, I don't care! Do your dream on the beach in Costa Rica or wherever the hell it is you want to do it.

FELDER: You think I like this? Selling disability insurance to morons? "Well sir, uh, excuse me, but what if you should break your neck on the shore on lose your leg in a car crash?" You listen to me, Tony. We agreed to wait ten years, and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

DET. FIORE: I listened to you once before and look what happened.

FELDER: Nobody - not me, not Barbala - wanted to see Charlie wind up like that. We were just trying to scare a little sense into him. It was an accident. End of story. And you better pull yourself together, Tony.

(That evening, Felder walks along a city street. An old woman comes out of an alley.)

OLD WOMAN: Excuse me, sir.

(He ignores her. He gets onto a bus. Later, the bus comes to another stop and he gets off at the door at the rear of the bus. He throws his scarf over his shoulder. The end of the scarf mysteriously rises and extends back into the bus, wrapping itself around the railing. When the bus door closes, Felder feels the tug around his neck.)

FELDER: Hey, what? Hey! Hey, open the door! Hey!

(The bus starts to pull away. Felder pounds the door and runs along with the bus.)

FELDER: Hey, open the door! Hey! Open the door! Hey! Open the door! Open the door! Hey! Open the door!

(The driver hears him shouting and sees him in his side rearview mirror. He hits the break, but the accelerator mysteriously floors itself. The bus picks up speed and Felder is now running at full speed.)

FELDER: Hey! Hey! Open the door! For God's sake! Help me!

(Felder can't keep up and falls, now being dragged by the bus. The driver still sees him and pumps the brake but the bus doesn't slow down and Felder screams. Finally the accelerator releases and the bus comes to a halt. The driver runs back to Felder. As he approaches, we see that Michelle Bishop is sitting on the bus just behind the door.)




SCENE 7
(Mulder, Scully and Mrs. Bishop are in the precinct house.)

MULDER: A patrol unit picked her up a few blocks away from the bus stop.

MRS. BISHOP: (crying) What's going on?

SCULLY: We don't know. All we know is that your daughter has witnessed two deaths in the past two days.

MRS. BISHOP: She's only eight years old. She couldn't have possibly done anything.

MULDER: Mrs. Bishop, no one is accusing Michelle of anything.

MRS. BISHOP: She's just a little girl.

SCULLY: Is there anything that you haven't told us? Is there anything at all that you can think of that might shed some light on what happened tonight?

MRS. BISHOP: No.

SCULLY: Well, this police station has a designated room at the Sheraton. An officer will take you and Michelle over there.

MRS. BISHOP: Why is this happening to us. Why?

(Scully puts a hand on her shoulder. Detective Lazard approaches and motions Mulder aside.)

MULDER: I'm sorry, excuse me.

(They step a short distance away.)

DET. LAZARD: Listen to this. You know that guy that bought it tonight - Leon Felder? Before he started peddling life insurance, he was a cop out of the one-four. Guess who his partner used to be? Rudy Barbala.

(Mulder and Scully are in a room at the precinct reviewing the case files. Mulder has written on a blackboard. Under "Precinct 27" he has Morris' and Fiore's names. Under "Precinct 14" are Felder's and Barbala's names.)

SCULLY: Four cops.

MULDER: Three of whom are now dead.

(He crosses through the names of Morris, Felder and Barbala and circles Fiore's.)

SCULLY: Their only connection being a drug bust in Chinatown almost nine years ago.

MULDER: And a little girl from Orchard Park.

(He looks at a photo of a half dozen officers surrounding a cache of money from a bust and points out individual officers.)

MULDER: Morris, Fiore, Barbala and Felder. What's wrong with this picture?

SCULLY: Well, for one thing Fiore said he only knew Barbala by reputation.

MULDER: Right. Why would he say that?

SCULLY: I don't know.

(Scully pages through the file, looking puzzled.)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: There's a page gone from Morris' homicide file. Wonder where it could be?

MULDER: Is there a log sheet?

SCULLY: Should be. Yeah. (she reads from the log sheet on the file folder) Tony Fiore - checked out this afternoon.

(Scully and Mulder are back at Detective Fiore's residence. She knocks and Mrs. Fiore answers.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Fiore, we're sorry for the early hour, but is your husband home?

MRS. FIORE: No, he's not. He never came home last night.

MULDER: May we come in?

(Mulder looks around in the living room. He sees a salt-water aquarium with a "diver" giving off bubbles at the bottom. He also sees a cabinet with a number of origami figures of animals. There is a painting of animals on the wall behind it.)

MULDER: Scully. Look familiar?

(Mrs. Fiore enters with coffee.)

MRS. FIORE: He said he was working a double shift, but when I called the precinct, he wasn't scheduled. It's just not like him not to call.

SCULLY: Does your husband have any family or close friends in the area that he might go to if he were in trouble?

MRS. FIORE: I've been on the phone all night. Is he in any trouble?

SCULLY: Mrs. Fiore, did your husband ever mention a detective by the name of Rudy Barbala or an ex-police officer named Leon Felder?

MRS. FIORE: I don't think so.

MULDER: Someone you might have had dinner with once, a friend of Tony's from work? A name you can't remember, anything?

MRS. FIORE: We don't normally socialize with other cops.

MULDER: Mrs. Fiore, I couldn't help noticing your origami collection. Did you do all these yourself?

MRS. FIORE: Oh, no, not me. No, that was Charlie's hobby.

MULDER: Charlie?

MRS. FIORE: My first husband. He was born in Japan, his father was stationed there.

SCULLY: Not Charlie Morris, Tony's ex-partner?

MRS. FIORE: Yeah. (Mulder and Scully exchange a glance) I was waiting for him to come home too, nine years ago. Just like this. He was working on a whole set, you know, from the painting. The only animal he never got to was the giraffe - see, right there behind the zebra.

(Mulder and Scully leave the Fiore house and walk down the street.)

MULDER: Michelle is eight years old, that means that she was conceived at roughly the same time that Officer Morris was killed.

SCULLY: Do me a favor, Mulder. Let me say it. Reincarnation.

MULDER: Metempsychosis, transmigration, reimbodiment, call it what you will.

SCULLY: All based on the coincidence that Michelle Bishop and Officer Morris both practice the obscure art of paper folding?

MULDER: Well, what about the composite drawing and the dolls and the fact that Michelle was witness to two deaths that can be tied to Charlie Morris?

SCULLY: So what, you think he's back like Peter Proud to avenge his murder?

MULDER: It's not so far-fetched, Scully. Reincarnation is a basic tenet of many major religions.

SCULLY: That still doesn't explain how an eight-year-old girl can kill two grown men.

MULDER: Well, individuals with strong past-life memories often exhibit enhanced psychic abilities - ESP, telekinesis.

SCULLY: So where does that leave us?

MULDER: One short step away from proving the pre-existence of the human soul.

(Michelle Bishop is being hypnotized by a Dr. Spitz. The session is being videotaped, and Dr. Braun is in the room with the two of them. Mulder, Scully and Mrs. Bishop are watching through a window from the next room.)

DR. SPITZ: On a count of five, tell me where you are now ... one ... two ... three ... four ... five. Do you know where you are?

MICHELLE: Yes.

DR. SPITZ: Where? Tell me where you are.

MICHELLE: At home.

DR. SPITZ: What time of day is it?

MICHELLE: Night time.

DR. SPITZ: And how old are you?

MICHELLE: Twenty-four. (she suddenly becomes agitated) No! We can't! We can't do this! It's wrong!

DR. SPITZ: What's wrong? What can't you do? (she doesn't respond but breathes rapidly) It's all right, you can trust me.

MICHELLE: No! I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't!

(Dr. Braun has come out of the room and angrily confronts Mulder.)

DR. BRAUN: This is dangerous and irresponsible!

MULDER: Dr. Spitz has conducted hundreds of these sessions and ...

DR. BRAUN: (to Mrs. Bishop) If you allow this to continue, you could push Michelle deeper into withdrawal, maybe permanently.

MULDER: Is it any more dangerous than pumping her full of thorazine?

MICHELLE: (from the other room) They're killing me! They're killing me!

(Mrs. Bishop heads for her daughter.)

MRS. BISHOP: That's enough!

MICHELLE: No! No! No!

MRS. BISHOP: (hugging Michelle) It's OK. It's over. It's over. It's over.

(Later, Scully comes out of the office, finding Mulder in the hall.)

SCULLY: They just left.

MULDER: We almost had it, Scully. We were right there.

SCULLY: I know.

MULDER: We'll have to try it again.

SCULLY: Mrs. Bishop won't go for that, not in this lifetime anyway.

MULDER: Well, we have to change her mind.

SCULLY: How? And to what end? I mean, what exactly do you hope to discover by all this?

MULDER: The truth. What really happened to Charlie Morris nine years ago.

SCULLY: We'll find the truth when we find Fiore.

MULDER: If we find Fiore. And if he's still alive. Scully, you saw what happened in there.

SCULLY: What I saw was some traumatized little girl who for no apparent reason has some connection to Charlie Morris.

MULDER: All evidence suggests that Michelle Bishop IS Charlie Morris.

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: Short of her growing a moustache, how much more apparent does it have to become for you to accept it?

SCULLY: OK. Let's just say that, by some small miracle, you manage to convince Michelle's mother, and the next hypno-regression provides you with everything you could possible hope for. No grand jury is gonna listen to that kind of testimony. We still will not have an actionable case.

(Both are annoyed. Scully walks away.)

(Mulder is writing in his case journal. The video of Michelle's hypnosis session is playing on a monitor.)

MULDER: (voice-over) The inconclusive results of Michelle's past life regression do not shake my basic belief in hypnosis as a tool for psychological healing. Whether or not it offers us definitive proof of previous lifetimes is another matter. However, in this particular case, all other explanations seem to be even more wanting.

(He glances up at the monitor.)

ON VIDEO: And how old are you? Twenty-four. No, we can't! We can't do this! It's wrong! What's wrong? What can't you do?

(Mulder has noticed a burst of static just as Michelle become agitated. He rewinds and looks again.)

ON VIDEO: And how old are you? Twenty-four. No we can't!

(He sees the static again, just before Michelle says "no we can't". He rewinds.)

ON VIDEO: Twenty-four.

(He advances the tape frame-by-frame, isolating the static-filled image.)

(At the Fiore residence, Mrs. Fiore is on the phone.)

MRS. FIORE: (to phone) No, no, I, I, I want to be here. In case he shows up. Thanks again. I'll, uh, I'll call you the minute I hear anything. OK, yeah, OK, bye-bye.

(She hangs up, turns off the light and heads upstairs for the night. As she nears the top, she hears a knock on the door and hurries to it.)

MRS. FIORE: Tony! (she opens the door) Tony? Tony?

(No one is there. She looks down and finds an origami figure of a giraffe on the porch.)




SCENE 8
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS, BUFFALO, NEW YORK
(Linhart is working in front of a series of video monitors. Scully and Mulder are behind him.)

LINHART: I checked the windup profiles. They're up to speed.

SCULLY: Which means?

LINHART: Whatever this image is, was recorded in the room with that girl.

SCULLY: How is that possible?

MULDER: There was a documented case in the early seventies of a man from Porlock, Ohio, who could influence undeveloped film. He could create shapes on the negative from his mind.

LINHART: I don't know how much of this noise I can clean up. It depends on the strength of the latent image.

(Lazard enters.)

DET. LAZARD: I tracked him down. He's retired in Palm Beach. You were right, Agent Scully. He backed up all his records on disk.

SCULLY: Pathologists are paranoid by nature.

DET. LAZARD: Well, he faxed me the missing page from the autopsy report.

SCULLY: Great. (reads it) Apparently, Charlie Morris did not die as a result of his wounds. Says here there's a frothing of fluid in the respiratory tract. That indicates death by drowning.

MULDER: So you're saying he was drowned first and then mutilated to make it look like a signature execution?

DET. LAZARD: Dr. Yamaguchi said on the phone that there were no signs of submersion such as goose skin or wrinkled flesh except for around the face and head.

SCULLY: Um-hmm. That's right. Suggesting that he was killed in either a bathtub or a toilet. Except ...

MULDER: Except for what?

SCULLY: The marked bradycardia. That indicates a raised plasma sodium level. He was killed in sea water.

(A car screeches to a halt in front of the Fiore residence. Detective Fiore emerges carrying a tote bag. He runs into the house.)

DET. FIORE: Anita! Anita!

MRS. FIORE: (rushing downstairs and hugging him) Tony! Tony! What's going on? Where've you been? I know something's going on.

DET. FIORE: I need you to listen to me right now. I need you to go upstairs and pack a bag.

MRS. FIORE: Why? What kind of trouble are you in?

DET. FIORE: I think someone's trying to kill me.

MRS. FIORE: Who?

DET. FIORE: I don't know.

MRS. FIORE: Why would anybody want to kill you? Tell me what's going on.

DET. FIORE: (angrily) Will you please just do what I'm asking you? (calms down) Please, I'm your husband and I love you and I need you to trust me on this, OK?

(He goes upstairs. Through the window we can see Michelle Bishop on the front porch.)

(Linhart is still working on the image from the video.)

LINHART: Almost there. (Mulder and Scully walk toward him) What I've done is to map the frequencies of the interference. Coefficients for sine on this monitor, cosine on that one. Now using an algorithm program, I can remove the frequencies, like this. Presto! What the hell?

(The image clears up, showing a diver in a pressure suit with helmet. Mulder recognizes it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what is it?

MULDER: You said salt water, right?

SCULLY: Right. So?

MULDER: So Charlie Morris was drowned in his own tropical fish tank, and that's the last thing he saw before he died. We better hope Michelle Bishop is at home, tucked in bed.

(At the Fiore residence, Detective Fiore is packing some clothes, and we see that the tote bag is full of money. Mrs. Fiore enters the room and he quickly zips up the bag.)

MRS. FIORE: Tony? Tony, somebody, somebody left this on our doorstep tonight. (shows him the origami giraffe) Do you know who? (he doesn't reply) Answer me, Tony!

(The lights go off. Fiore draws his gun.)

DET. FIORE: Right, you stay here and keep the door closed.

(He closes the door. The key in the lock mysteriously turns, locking the door.)

(He comes downstairs slowly, gun raised. As he steps across the living room, an electrical cord unplugs itself from the wall and quickly wraps around his legs, tripping him to the floor. He drops his gun onto the floor in front of him. Mrs. Fiore hears the commotion.)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) Tony, are you all right? Tony, answer me!

(Fiore reaches for the gun, but it slides farther away from him, out of reach. He looks up and sees Michelle standing in front of him.)

(Mulder and Scully pull up in front. They hear a crash from inside the house and run up to the porch. Mulder tries the door but it slams and locks in his face. They hear Mrs. Fiore.)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) Tony! Tony, please! Who's there? What's happening?

(Mulder walks across the porch to the window but the shutters slam closed in his face.)

(Inside, Michelle looks around the room and glass shatters and other items go crashing to the floor.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Scully has called Mulder to the side of the house, where there is a door to the basement with a glass window. They shield their eyes, and Mulder breaks the glass with his elbow, reaches in and unlocks the door.)

(Back in the living room, Detective Fiore has gotten to his knees in front of Michelle.)

DET. FIORE: (emotionally) They said they were just gonna talk to you. Talk some sense into you. What was I supposed to do, huh? All you had to do was take the money, man! Why didn't you just take the money?

(Michelle looks aside, and a fireplace poker hurtles across the room, catching Fiore a glancing blow. He falls over and moans in pain. Several vases fly across the room and break across his head as well.)

(Mulder and Scully have climbed the stairs from the basement to the main floor.)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) What's going on, Tony? Let me out!

MULDER: (to Scully) Go check out upstairs. (she heads up the stairs)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) Please open the door! I'm scared! Tony!

(More objects are flying off cabinets in the living room as Mulder enters. He sees Michelle with Fiore on the floor.)

MULDER: Michelle! This won't make right what happened.

MRS. FIORE: (from the upstairs bedroom) Please, I can't get out! Who's there? I can't get out!

(Scully unlocks the bedroom door, and they both then run down to the living room. Mrs. Fiore rushes to her husband and sees Michelle. She kneels on the floor behind him.)

MRS. FIORE: Tony! Tony! Tony ...

(Fiore starts to look back at her, then just looks downward at the floor.)

DET. FIORE: (to Mrs. Fiore) I'm sorry! I knew what they did to Charlie. I was a part of it and I never said anything. I couldn't.

MRS. FIORE: No.

DET. FIORE: (now looking back at her) I just wanted to take care of you. Who else would have taken care of you?

(The room is filled with a bluish light and the aquarium shakes. Glass in the room shatters and plaster flies off.)

DET. FIORE: Oh, God. No. No more.

MRS. FIORE: (to Michelle, pleadingly) Please, please don't hurt him any more.

(Michelle looks quickly at the aquarium, and its walls shatter, sending water to the floor. The lights come back on. Scully walks across and picks up Fiore's gun. The diver ornament from the aquarium is on the floor nearby.)

(Some time later, Mulder and Mrs. Bishop walk alongside her pool. Michelle is laughing and playing in the pool with a friend and an instructor. Mrs. Bishop smiles as she watches the scene, and Mulder has traces of a smile as well.)

MULDER: (voice-over) Closing entry, file number X-40271. Detective Anthony Fiore pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court to charges of first-degree murder after the fact, grand larceny and obstruction of justice. The deaths of Detective Rudy Barbala and former police officer Leon Felder are being ruled as accidental, although their complicity in the murder of Officer Charlie Morris has been definitively established. No charges were brought against Michelle Bishop, who today took her first swimming lesson. She claims no memory of the preceding events and both her mother and Dr. Braun have denied my request for a second past-life regression. End of field journal, April 19, 1994.

Agents of record: Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.
Status: Unexplained.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
MAHAN PROPULSION LABORATORY,
WASHINGTON INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, COLSON, WASHINGON
(A janitor, Roland Fuller, is cleaning the floor in a hallway. He swipes his badge through a reader and then enters a code on the keypad, but the door doesn't open. Another man, Dr. Keats, approaches as Roland tries it again, unsuccessfully. Impatiently, the man grabs the badge from Roland.)

DR. KEATS: Here, let me do it. Put your number in, then your card. What's your number, Roland?

ROLAND: 315.

(Keats punches in the code and then swipes the card through the reader. The door opens.)

DR. KEATS: See how easy it is?

(As Keats enters, a jet engine is running in a wind tunnel. Drs. Nollette and Surnow are in front of the controls.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Engine efficiency?

DR. SURNOW: 94%.

(The mach indicator climbs above 13.0.)

DR. NOLLETTE: We need more. How's the backpressure holding?

DR. SURNOW: What do you think? It's climbing.

DR. NOLLETTE: Increase the blade inclination. I said, increase the blade inclination!

DR. SURNOW: The inclination of the blade is pi over 9. We've reached maximum velocity.

(Surnow reaches for a switch on the controls but Nollette grabs his hand.)

DR. NOLLETTE: No. Let it go! It will work!

DR. SURNOW: The engine's going to destroy itself! I'm not going to do that!

(Surnow hits a key on the keyboard. The engine starts to wind down.)

DR. NOLLETTE: It's not going to destroy itself. Come on, we're almost there!

DR. SURNOW: There's something wrong with our equation.

(The engine continues to wind down as Keats approaches from behind.)

DR. KEATS: What happened?

DR. NOLLETTE: Nothing. Because Surnow pulled the plug.

DR. SURNOW: I'm just protecting the baby ... and four years of work, Frank!

DR. NOLLETTE: Four years of work that's going to add up to zilch, because unless we show some progress, they're going to pull the plug on us, Ron.

(Nollette leaves.)

DR. KEATS: He's right, you know. We should have continued with the test.

DR. SURNOW: Somebody's going to crack Mach 15, and I want that someone to be us. I'm not going to jeopardize everything just because you two guys can't wait to see your name in print!

DR. KEATS: It's the print that gets the money, Ron.

DR. SURNOW: If you want to go down in flames together, fine. You go ahead. I'm gonna do the math.

(Keats leaves.)

ROLAND: Good night, Dr. Keats.

(Surnow is writing an equation on a whiteboard while Roland cleans the floor. Surnow then hits a key and the door to the wind tunnel opens. He steps in and opens an interior panel to get at the controls. Roland goes to the keyboard and hits a key. The door to the wind tunnel closes with Surnow still inside.)

DR. SURNOW: What the hell?

(He looks through a window and sees Roland at the keyboard.)

DR. SURNOW: Roland, open the door. Open the door. Roland, I want you to listen to me very carefully. We have to open this door, Roland. Stop typing, Roland!

(Roland has continued typing at the keyboard, and the inlet vanes for the wind tunnel open. Then the engine starts and the wind velocity begins to climb.)

DR. SURNOW: Roland, open the door! What are you doing? Open the door!

(The mach indicator approaches 1.0, and Surnow's clipboard is carried into the engine by the wind.)

DR. SURNOW: Roland! Are you listening?

(Roland stops typing and moves to the whiteboard, as Surnow struggles against the wind to the inlet end of the tunnel. Roland erases the equation that Surnow had written. Surnow hooks his fingers on the metal grating at the end of the tunnel as the wind lifts his feet. Surnow screams as the mach indicator passes 3.0. Roland starts writing his own equation on the whiteboard. The mach indicator passes 4.0, and Surnow is now horizontal, hanging onto the screen and screaming. Roland finishes writing the equation, and the mach indicator approaches 7.0. As Roland walks back to the keyboard, through the window Surnow is seen flying down the tunnel toward the jet engine. There is a squishing noise. Roland resumes cleaning the floor.)





SCENE 2
(Mulder and Scully walk down the hallway leading to the wind tunnel control room.)

MULDER: How was the wedding?

SCULLY: You mean the part where the groom passed out or the dog bit the drummer?

MULDER: Did you catch the bouquet?

SCULLY: May-be. (looking at a folder in Mulder's hand) So is that what you couldn't talk to me about over the phone?

MULDER: (handing her the folder) The project that everyone says doesn't exist, does exist.

SCULLY: (reading the label on it) The Icarus project?

MULDER: The next generation in jet engine design, capable of doubling current supersonic speeds using half the fuel. At least in theory.

SCULLY: And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist who worked on it here at the university.

MULDER: Yes.

SCULLY: How close are they?

MULDER: I'm not sure, but Surnow is the second scientist on the team to die in the last six months.

SCULLY: OK, but how is this an X-file? Mulder, you don't think this has anything to do with UFO technology?

MULDER: There's something unexplainable here, Scully, but it's certainly not unidentifiable.

(They enter the control room.)

MULDER: (to a man inside the door) Keats?

MAN: (pointing at Keats) There.

MULDER: Dr. Keats? We're with the FBI. I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. (Mulder flashes his badge and they shake hands) We understand you discovered Dr. Surnow this morning.

DR. KEATS: What was left of him.

(They walk into the wind tunnel, where several other scientists, including Nollette, are inspecting the engine.)

SCULLY: How do you suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel?

DR. KEATS: Someone must have shut him in. The door can only be opened or locked from in there.

SCULLY: By computer?

DR. KEATS: We've already been through this with the police. How many times do we have to rehash it?

SCULLY: Another member of your team died a short time ago. Isn't that correct?

DR. NOLLETTE: (walking over to them) Yes. Arthur Grable. He was killed in an automobile accident in November. I'm Frank Nollette. I'm also on the project.

(He shakes hands with Mulder and Scully.)

SCULLY: Are you certain it was an accident?

DR. KEATS: What are you driving at?

(Mulder exits the wind tunnel.)

SCULLY: Your work seems to be a perfect target for industrial espionage.

(Keats and Nollette exchange glances. Mulder is in the control room, looking at the whiteboard, which has several equations written on it.)

MULDER: (pointing at the bottom line) Who wrote this?

(The other three join Mulder in the control room.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Ron was working on it when I left.

MULDER: You see, the handwriting here doesn't seem to match any of the other handwriting on the board.

DR. KEATS: It isn't mine.

MULDER: (checking the folder) What about Roland Fuller?

DR. NOLLETTE: Uh, Roland's the, uh, janitor.

MULDER: Well, according to the police report, he was the only other person here last night.

DR. KEATS: Roland didn't do that.

SCULLY: How do you know?

DR. KEATS: Let's just say Roland isn't exactly a rocket scientist.




SCENE 3
HERITAGE HALFWAY HOUSE, COLSON, WASHINGTON
(Roland is licking and applying adhesive stars to a poster that has "Tracy" written on it. He pushes it across the table to Tracy.)

ROLAND: Here.

TRACY: "Tracy."

ROLAND: With stars.

MRS. STODIE: (walking in with Mulder and Scully) Roland? There are some people here would like to talk with you.

ROLAND: Uh-oh. I went off the paper. Sorry.

MRS. STODIE: That's all right, Roland. Tracy, would you like to come help me in the TV room?

TRACY: OK.

(Mrs. Stodie and Tracy exit.)

MULDER: Hi, Roland. Do you mind if we sit down?

ROLAND: OK.

MULDER: Thanks. You mind if we ask you a couple of questions? Do you remember working last night?

ROLAND: Uh-huh.

SCULLY: Do you remember seeing anything unusual? Seeing any strangers? (Roland shakes his head.) Did, um, did Dr. Surnow or Dr. Keats or Dr. Nollette do anything unusual?

ROLAND: Nope.

SCULLY: You must like stars.

ROLAND: One hundred and forty-seven.

SCULLY: Sorry?

ROLAND: (pointing at Scully's blouse) Stars.

(Scully looks down at her blouse, which has stars on it.)

MULDER: You like numbers, too.

(Roland has a sudden vision in which Dr. Keats' head is frozen. He reacts violently, pushing the container of stars off the table. He runs around and starts to gather them. Scully comes around to help.)

SCULLY: Roland, let me help you.

ROLAND: (as he picks up the stars) One, two, three, four, five ...

(Mulder looks down at a piece of paper that Roland was working on. It has the number 15626 written on it in several places.)

ROLAND: ... six ...

MRS. STODIE: (entering the room) Roland.

ROLAND: ... seven ...

MRS. STODIE: Is everything ok?

ROLAND: ... eight, nine ...

(Mulder folds and pockets the piece of paper.)

MRS. STODIE: Roland, are you all right?

ROLAND: ... ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen ...

MRS. STODIE: What happened?

ROLAND: ... fourteen ...

MRS. STODIE: What did you say to upset him so?

ROLAND: ... fifteen, sixteen, seventeen ...




SCENE 4
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
(Mulder and Scully are consulting with a handwriting analyst, who has the whiteboard writing displayed on the wall with an overhead projector.)

ANALYST: It's definitely the work of a fourth and distinct individual. Dr. Surnow's, Dr. Keats', and Dr. Nollette's cursive standards don't match what you found on the whiteboard.

MULDER: Would you do me a favor and try this?

(He hands the analyst the paper that he took from Roland.)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: It's something Roland was doodling at the home.

SCULLY: You don't really think that Roland ...

MULDER: Besides Nollette and Keats, he's the only person we can prove was in the lab that night.

SCULLY: Yes, but we're talking about a sophisticated fluid dynamics equation. Roland Fuller barely has an IQ of 70.

MULDER: Well, you saw his facility with mathematics. Don't some autistic individuals display unusual abilities?

SCULLY: Yes, but even savants behave only as human calculators. I mean, they can perform certain functions but they can't tell you the value of anything or even the meaning of a number.

ANALYST: I hate to take sides, guys, but the bottom line is no. The terminal stroke on the 6, the roof on the 5 - I'm sorry. He didn't write it.

(Roland is tossing and turning in his sleep. He sees a fleeting vision of Dr. Keats struggling with someone. He awakens.)




SCENE 5
MAHAN PROPULSON LABORATORY, BUILDING 214
(Keats is working in the laboratory. He is listening to music through headphones as he sits at a terminal. The door to the lab opens and Roland enters. He sneaks up on Keats from behind and smashes his coffee cup over his head. He then drags the unconscious Keats over to a large container of liquid nitrogen and takes off the lid.

Wearing cryogenic gloves, he grabs Keats and tries to put his head down into the liquid nitrogen. Keats revives and struggles, but Roland grabs his hair and forces his head down into it. Seconds later, he lifts his frozen head out of the container and throws his body to the side. There is a shattering noise. As Roland walks away, there are pieces of Keats' head on the floor. Roland steps on what looks like an ear. There is the sound of typing on a keyboard.)




SCENE 6
(Scully and Mulder are at the scene of Keats' murder. On the floor is the usual outline of the body, except there is no head. There are a couple dozen "X" marks around the body as well as the outlines of several larger pieces. A policeman, detective and police photographer are also there.)

SCULLY: An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees will become frozen, exhibiting great tensile strength, but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact. Now, I've seen this demonstrated on a fish before ...

MULDER: I don't think they'll be performing this experiment on Beakman's World. (he walks over to the detective and points at the computer) Has this been dusted?

DETECTIVE: Treat yourself.

(Mulder sits at the terminal and pulls up a file directory. The directory shows the last two entries are KMAN.DOC and ARTHUR.DOC. Below is a password prompt.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully! Look at these files. KMAN, must be Keats. His file was turned off at 12:31 last night.

SCULLY: But look, someone else entered a file under the name Arthur after 12:31.

MULDER: And worked on it for nearly 5 hours.

SCULLY: Well, it couldn't have been Keats. Judging from the rigor of the body, he was dead around 12:30.

MULDER: So you're saying someone came in here, killed Keats, and then just did some work on an old Dr. Arthur Grable file?

(Scully tries to look at the file but gets an "access denied" message.)

SCULLY: Well, I can't access the ARTHUR file. We're gonna need the password.

MULDER: Try 15626.

(Scully looks puzzled but tries it. A graph of turbine entry temperature appears on the screen.)

SCULLY: How did you know that that ...

MULDER: This is Arthur Grable's work on the same fluid dynamics equation the others were working on. (he pages through other graphs) Look at all those entries. Someone has been continuing his work in the six months since he died.

SCULLY: How did you know what the password was?

(He shows her Roland's page of doodling that has 15626 written on it.)

(Roland is dreaming.)

[A small child stands on a porch in front of a woman who says "Wave bye. Wave goodbye." Another child, a twin of the first, is crying as a woman puts him into the back seat of a car. The woman's voice continues to say "Wave goodbye."]

(Roland awakens. He is in bed but wearing his work clothes. Mrs. Stodie enters.)

MRS. STODIE: Roland? Why did you sleep in your clothes last night? Well, let's get you dressed. You have visitors.

(Mulder and Scully walk in behind her.)

ROLAND: (to Mrs. Stodie) I'm not supposed to talk to them.

MRS. STODIE: Who told you that? Remember that talk we had about being shy. These are nice people, Roland.

(Mulder has ducked into Roland's closet.)

MULDER: Hey, Roland, you've got more shirts than I do. (holds up a navy blue shirt with white patterns on it) I think this one would look stylin' today. What do you think?

ROLAND: The green one.

MULDER: The green one?

ROLAND: Please.

SCULLY: Mrs. Stodie, can I talk to you a second? See you later, Roland.

(Scully and Mrs. Stodie leave the room.)

MULDER: (pulls out the green shirt) This one? Here you go. So you like your job at the college, Roland?

ROLAND: (putting on the shirt) Yes.

MULDER: I hear you're very good at it. You remember how you got your job?

ROLAND: A man talked to Mrs. Stodie.

MULDER: What man?

ROLAND: Dr. Grable.

MULDER: Was Dr. Grable nice to you?

ROLAND: Yes.

MULDER: When was the last time you spoke to him? Last week, the day before?

ROLAND: Dr. Grable died.

MULDER: I'm sorry.

ROLAND: Yeah. People die. They go away ... and they're not supposed to come back.

(Scully and Mrs. Stodie talk in another room. Lisa is cleaning the floor nearby.)

SCULLY: Has Roland ever mentioned the name Arthur?

MRS. STODIE: That was Dr. Grable's first name. But we only called him Dr. Grable. I doubt Roland even knew his first name was Arthur.

(Lisa has stopped cleaning and is eavesdropping.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Stodie, can I get a copy of Roland's file and past history?

MRS. STODIE: Our patients' histories are confidential.

SCULLY: I understand, but I have grounds to obtain them, and the less time we have to spend in court, the more time we have to help Roland.

(Mulder and Scully are sitting at a table in a library.)

MULDER: Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable. He went to the halfway house specifically to find a mentally challenged person.

SCULLY: Are you suggesting that Arthur Grable hired Roland in order to use him? (Mulder arches his eyebrows) And are you suggesting that Arthur Grable is not dead?

MULDER: Well, if he had intentions of killing Nollette, Keats and Surnow, why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect?

SCULLY: Yeah, but by the look of this, (she holds up a photo of Grable's accident scene) he's hamburger.

MULDER: Maybe he staged it. That would explain why his work is continuing on, six months after his "death".

SCULLY: (reading from Grable's file) This obituary says that Arthur Grable was born in Seattle. His father was a big banker, his mother was active in a number of charities. Only child. Summa cum laude in physics. Doctoral and post-doctoral in aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd. Brilliant future, tragically cut short.

MULDER: (reading from Roland's file) Roland's also from Seattle. He spent most of his life at the Heritage Halfway House. The identity of his parents has been sealed by the courts. There's very little information on Roland before the age of three. That's when he was put in the Heritage program.

SCULLY: Does it say when he was born?

MULDER: (flipping through some pages) July 15, 1952.

SCULLY: (also flipping through pages) That's also Arthur's birthdate.

(Tracy and Roland are at the halfway house, drawing. Roland is drawing an airplane.)

ROLAND: Don't you wish you could fly?

TRACY: I can ... when I dream. (walks over to him) People can do anything in a dream, you know. Once, one time I had a dream we were married and lived in a house. Do you have dreams, Roland?

(He looks agitated. Tracy kneels next to him.)

TRACY: You can tell me. Roland? Who's Arthur?

(Roland turns to her suddenly. He has a vision of pushing Tracy to the floor and choking her. He screams, pushes her aside and runs out of the room.)

TRACY: (crying) I'm sorry, Roland. I'm sorry!

(Roland has run upstairs and locked himself in the bathroom. He sits on the floor.)

TRACY: (knocking on the door) Roland! Roland.

ROLAND: (shouting) Go away!

(He has another vision of him choking Tracy.)

TRACY: Roland, what's the matter?

ROLAND: Go away! I don't want to hurt you. Go away! (Tracy is crying at the door) Go away.




SCENE 7
(Mulder and Scully are with Nollette in his office. Mulder points at a photo showing some "hippie" students in an office. There is a Volkswagen behind them.)

MULDER: Is that you?

DR. NOLLETTE: Yes.

MULDER: Cool 'do. What's the story here?

DR. NOLLETTE: (sighs) Um, a quantum physics professor of mine at Harvey Mudd flunked me. He challenged the tenets of one of my theories - a theory I later published in 'Nature'. Anyway, uh, to get back him, (laughs) one afternoon we decided to take his car apart and put it back together again in his office and left it running.

MULDER: (to Scully) Hmmm, an egghead classic.

DR. NOLLETTE: It was Arthur Grable's idea.

SCULLY: Is that Arthur Grable there, sitting on the chair?

(She's referring to a bearded man sitting in the foreground.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Yeah.

SCULLY: Was he a practical joker?

DR. NOLLETTE: On top of all his brilliance, he had a genius for executing elaborate schemes.

MULDER: Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 IQ is gaining access to and, uh, operating his old computer files?

DR. NOLLETTE: Arthur would still have to be alive.

SCULLY: Could he have faked his own death?

DR. NOLLETTE: No.

MULDER: The police report on the auto accident that killed Arthur Grable is woefully incomplete. The dry road surface, no mechanical problems found. The body was never admitted to the county morgue and there was no funeral.

DR. NOLLETTE: (standing) If, uh, you are trying to suggest that Arthur Grable killed Surnow and Keats and is after me next, you're way off. Art could not have done the murders.

SCULLY: How can you be so certain?




SCENE 8
AVALON FOUNDATION,
WASHINGTON INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, COLSON, WASHINGTON
(Mulder and Scully are talking to a Dr. Barrington. They are looking at a stainless steel tank, numbered '18', that has a temperature indicator on it that reads -320F.)

BARRINGTON: This is Arthur Grable. Uh, because of the massive internal damage to his body caused by the car accident, we could only preserve the head.

SCULLY: Wouldn't your client find it somewhat inconvenient to be thawed out in the future, only to discover he had no functional mobility?

BARRINGTON: We believe that by the time science figures a way to revive our clients ...

MULDER: ... you'll also know how to clone new bodies for them.

BARRINGTON: Exactly. This technology is progressing faster than anyone thought possible. Ask anyone here at the university. So, while for us the passing of each second brings our bodies closer to death, for our clients it brings them closer to life.

(Mulder notices that the temperature indicator is fluctuating between -319 and -320.)

MULDER: These fluctuations in temperature - do they happen often?

BARRINGTON: No, we've had some problems with Dr. Grable's capsule, and the technicians have checked it for possible malfunctions but they found nothing.

MULDER: Is it possible the brain is causing the fluctuation?

BARRINGTON: No, but we are looking for the explanation. The patient's in no danger. He remains perfectly preserved as long as there's liquid nitrogen in the capsule.

SCULLY: May we take a look at Arthur Grable's records? (he hands her a file) Thank you. Dr. Barrington, in your conception of future medical science, what requirements will exist to be an organ or tissue donor?

BARRINGTON: Same requirements as there are today, compatible genetic make-up. It's best if the donor's related.

(The temperature indicator fluctuates again and beeps. Barrington walks over to investigate. Scully calls Mulder over to her.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Arthur Grable put down only one donor.

(The form lists Roland Fuller.)

MULDER: Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable had the same birthday. I think they're twins.

(Mulder and Scully are working with a technician in front of a computer. They are altering a photo of Arthur Grable.)

TECHNICIAN: Older or younger?

MULDER: Same age, just less hairy and with better eyesight.

TECHNICIAN: Gotcha. And the moustache?

SCULLY: No, lose the whole beard.

(As the technician types, Arthur Grable's glasses disappear as well as his beard and moustache.)

TECHNICIAN: Next?

MULDER: Close cropped hair, with a slightly receding widow's peak. Lose the glasses.

(The face on the screen looks exactly like Roland.)

SCULLY: That's Roland.

MULDER: Give or take a few pounds.

(Mulder is talking to Roland at the halfway house.)

ROLAND: Tell me about your dreams, Roland. (he doesn't respond) It's all right, I won't tell anybody. (still no response) You know, I had a dream last night. I dreamt I was, uh, swimming in this pool. And I could see my father underwater, but when I dove down, the water stung my eyes. Then there was another man at the pool, watching me. He upset me. He was asking me questions I didn't want to answer. And I had to leave. I couldn't find my father.

ROLAND: I can't tell you my dreams.

MULDER: Why not?

ROLAND: Bad.

MULDER: (putting his hand on Roland's shoulder) Your dreams are bad, Roland. Not you. You're a good person.

ROLAND: I hit Tracy.

(Nearby, Tracy looks over at Roland.)

MULDER: Your dreams make you hit Tracy?

(He nods. Mulder sees a remote control spaceship toy on the shelf. He picks it up.)

MULDER: You know how to work this toy, Roland?

ROLAND: Yeah.

(Mulder puts the toy on the floor and gives the remote control to Roland. He operates the control and the ship scoots across the floor.)

MULDER: Now, you see the way you work that toy is like what's happening to you. You're the spaceship, Roland, and your dreams are the controls.

ROLAND: But who ... who runs the controls?

MULDER: (showing him a photo of Arthur Grable) Have you seen this man recently?

(Roland looks at the photo and reacts strongly. He sees visions of two small boys, twins, running out on a porch. One, crying, is loaded into a car, while the other stays on the porch. A voice says "wave bye-bye to Roland." He then sees the coffee cup being broken over Keats' head, Surnow flying toward the jet engine, Keats' frozen head and Tracy being choked. Roland screams and thrashes about in his chair.)

MULDER: (trying to calm him) Roland! Roland! Roland, stop!

(He runs out of the room, screaming. Tracy follows him.)

TRACY: Roland!

(Scully and Mrs. Stodie have heard the commotion and come out to see Tracy following Roland up the stairs. Roland locks himself in the bathroom again.)

TRACY: Roland! Roland!

MULDER: (heading upstairs with Scully and Mrs. Stodie) We need to arrange to keep Roland under observation.

TRACY: (at the bathroom door) Roland! Roland!

(Roland sees a vision of the bathroom window broken. Moments later, there is a crashing sound.)

MULDER: He's trying to get away.

TRACY: Roland! Roland!

(Mulder runs downstairs and out the door, looking for Roland.)

MULDER: Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland!

(He doesn't find him. Upstairs, Scully looks out the broken window.)




SCENE 9
MAHAN PROPULSION LABORATORY
(It is late evening. Mulder and Scully are in a hallway. He has just gotten off the phone.)

MULDER: Nollette's gone. We should arrange a security guard to find him.

SCULLY: Mulder, no one's gonna provide you with anything once you explain your theory on how Roland Fuller is capable of these murders.

MULDER: You've got a brother, don't you Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah. I've got an older one and a younger one.

MULDER: Well, have you ever thought about calling one of them all day long and then all of a sudden the phone rings and it's one of them calling you?

SCULLY: Does this pitch somehow end with a way for me to lower my long distance charges?

MULDER: I believe in psychic connections, and evidence suggests that it's stronger between family members, strongest of all between twin siblings that shared the same womb.

SCULLY: OK, maybe. But in this case, one sibling has closer ties to a frozen fudgesicle than he does to his own brother.

MULDER: Arthur Grable is not dead. He's in a state of consciousness that no human has ever returned from. And what if that state allows one to develop psychic ability to a potential that the conscious mind is too preoccupied to explore or believe in? He could use that ability to control his brother to kill those scientists.

SCULLY: But why? He's been working with these colleagues for years.

MULDER: Well, that's a question that only Dr. Nollette can answer.

SCULLY: OK. Let's go. I have to call my brother.

(As they walk away, Nollette is watching them on a security TV monitor. He has heard their conversation. The monitor shows them walking down the hall.)

MULDER: We've got to find Nollette.

SCULLY: Let's talk to campus security.

MULDER: We go this way? (pointing straight ahead)

SCULLY: No, we go left.

(Mulder follows Scully.)

(Later, Nollette is at the Avalon Foundation.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Well, wherever you are, Arthur, I'm sure you'll appreciate this.

(Nollette wraps aluminum foil over a badge and swipes it through a reader. The door opens and he walks to Arthur Grable's tank. Using a pen, he punches buttons on the control panel. The temperature display begins to rise, up to -312 as Nollette leaves.)

(Back at the Mahan Propulsion Laboratory, Roland is writing, with both hands, on either side of a notebook. The temperature in Grable's tank reaches -307 and Roland reacts, looking slightly ill. He continues to write equations in the notebook.)




SCENE 10
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
(Scully and Mulder are reviewing the case. Scully reads from a file.)

SCULLY: Arthur and Roland Grable, born at Puget Presbyterian to Mr. and Mrs. Louis Grable on July 15, 1952. Arthur was four minutes older than Roland.

(She puts the file in front of him.)

MULDER: Identical twins.

SCULLY: Which means that they're the result of a single egg fertilized by a single sperm.

MULDER: I've read studies which suggest that in some cases the identical twin arises very early in the embryonic stage when a mutation in one cell is rejected by the other cells as foreign.

SCULLY: So that maybe Roland's condition is the result of a damaged chromosome rejected by one of Arthur's cells?

MULDER: In a way, that would explain Arthur's genius and Roland's strange mathematical gift.

SCULLY: In a way. (the phone rings) (to phone) Agent Scully.

BARRINGTON: (on phone) This is Larry Barrington at the Avalon Foundation. We've, uh, got a situation here.

(Barrington is talking on a cell phone. He is near Arthur Grable's tank, which now reads -168.

SCULLY: Uh-huh.

BARRINGTON: Last night we had a break-in at the facility. That's right. Yeah, it's Arthur Grable's storage unit. His internal thermostat's been compromised.

SCULLY: Was there any tissue damage?

BARRINGTON: We're trying to assess that now. The temperature's still rising. Something's blocking our access to the cooling program.

SCULLY: (hangs up) (to Mulder) Someone tampered with Arthur Grable's capsule. They're attempting to stabilize it now.

MULDER: Nollette?

(At the laboratory, Roland is operating the wind tunnel, typing rapidly on the keyboard. Roland is sweating. The temperature on Arthur Grable's tank continues to rise. The mach indicator hovers at 13.8 as Roland looks ill. He types some more on the keyboard and groans.)

ROLAND: What? What is it?

(He concentrates, and the temperature on Arthur Grable's tank goes from -158 to -161. He types again and the engine speeds up and the mach reading rises, to a high of 15.13. A bell sounds, and Nollette appears behind Roland.)

DR. NOLLETTE: "If I've seen further than other men, it's because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."

ROLAND: No. This isn't yours!

DR. NOLLETTE: It's amazing. There's this body, sitting there in front of me, talking. But you're controlling it, Arthur.

ROLAND: You ... took my work!

DR. NOLLETTE: What good was your work going to do you? You died before you could finish it, before you could publish it.

ROLAND: It was mine!

DR. NOLLETTE: And a brilliant piece of work, too. When I saw the writing on the whiteboard, I knew someone had found the key. Mach 15 was within our reach. Our futures were guaranteed. Ironic, isn't it? You did all the work, and I get all the glory.

ROLAND: (screaming) No!

(Nollette produces a gun from his pocket.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Yes. Yes, Arthur. I was here, working on the intake problem, moments away from a solution when you attacked me. (he backs Roland away and sits at the controls) Fortunately, I was carrying a gun. After the murder of my colleagues, who could blame me?

(Roland sees a vision of Nollette flying toward the jet engine.)

ROLAND: No!

(Nollette is looking at Roland's work on the computer screen and typing.)

DR. NOLLETTE: That's, that's interesting. (laughs) I've got it. That's it. I've got it.

(Roland picks up a nearby keyboard and hits Nollette with it, knocking him to the floor.)

(Mulder and Scully arrive outside the laboratory. They pound on the door and flash their badges, and a guard lets them in.)

(The wind tunnel door closes with Nollette inside. At the controls, Roland struggles, then types. Nollette revives in the wind tunnel just as the engine starts. He goes to the window and pounds on it, looking at Roland.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Arthur! Arthur, open the door! Arthur!

(Mulder and Scully are running through the halls. Nollette moves back toward the tunnel inlet as the Mach indicator reaches 1.0. Scully swipes a badge through the door and they enter as Nollette grabs the metal grating in the tunnel. Mulder goes to the controls but doesn't know how to operate them. The wind speed is over mach 3.0, and Nollette is now hanging horizontally to the grate.)

MULDER: (to Roland) Arthur, how do you stop this? Tell me how! Arthur!

(Scully moves between Roland and Mulder.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder) Wait. (to Roland) Roland, we need you to help us. Please, we need you to help us to stop the machine.

(Roland is having flashbacks to the separation of the twins. A woman is saying "Bye-bye, Roland. Arthur, say goodbye to your brother.")

SCULLY: Try to remember how. Roland, you've got to help him or he's going to die.

(The tunnel is at mach 4.0. Nollette is barely hanging on. Roland has a flashback of the car carrying him away while the woman's voice says "Wave good-bye, Arthur." As the tunnel reaches mach 7.0, Roland goes to the keyboard but seems uncertain.)

MULDER: Come on, Roland.

ROLAND: I can't remember.

(He finally enters a command and the engine starts to slow just as Nollette loses his grip. He flies down the tunnel but lands several feet in front of the engine. Scully puts her hand on Roland's shoulder and gives him a reassuring nod.)

(The temperature of Arthur Grable's tank reaches -150 and an alarm goes off.)

(A Colson police car is in front of the halfway house.)

SCULLY: He'll be held in psychiatric custody for evaluation.

MRS. STODIE: Is he being charged with a crime?

SCULLY: The D.A. hasn't made that determination yet.

MULDER: But we've recommended that he be remanded to your custody as soon as the court deems it appropriate.

MRS. STODIE: How could this happen? Roland never exhibited any violent tendencies.

MULDER: It's my belief that he wasn't acting under his own volition.

(Scully gives Mulder a stare.)

MRS. STODIE: What do you mean?

(Mulder opens a notebook and shows it to her.)

MULDER: This is the work of Arthur Grable, Roland's brother. It's a new theory of jet propulsion, unfinished at the time of his death. In the last two weeks, Roland has completed the calculations.

MRS. STODIE: How?

(Mulder is about to answer but Scully interrupts.)

SCULLY: We're not sure, Mrs. Stodie. All we know is that Roland was somehow able to finish his brother's research.

(Roland is folding a shirt and putting it into a suitcase. Tracy enters the room.)

TRACY: Roland? Where are you going? Roland, don't go.

ROLAND: I have to.

TRACY: OK. Fine.

(Hurt, she walks toward the door. Roland calls her back.)

ROLAND: Tracy. Wait.

(He picks up his jar of stars and hands it to her.)

ROLAND: Keep my stars.

(She starts to cry as he walks past her.)

TRACY: I love you.

ROLAND: Me too.

(He passes Mulder and Scully in the hall, giving them a gesture of good-bye. He stops in front of a mirror to bursh his hair and stares into the mirror before walking away.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
SHIPWORKS; ARLIS, MARYLAND
(A car speeds down a small hill in the road, followed by a police car with sirens blaring. The car goes up a short hill and catches a few feet of air before hitting the ground. The police car does the same. The car does a sharp left turn as it passes a train. The train honks its horn as the police car follows pattern. The man in the car looks in his rear-view mirror.)

WOMAN ON APB WIRE: About your request for assistance, Fifty, what is your present location? Unit Fifty, go ahead.

(The man in the passenger's side talks into the transmitter. The cars race through a gate into a shipworks.)

OFFICER #1: Suspect is now westbound. Has entered the shade of the shipworks off April Street. Unit Fifty still in pursuit, over.

WOMAN ON APB WIRE: A roger, Unit Fifty, I copy. Be advised when you are...

(A truck backs up and the man swerves around it. The officer looks to his partner, a heavy-set man, who slams on the brakes and swerves to a halt. They drive around the truck. The man drives into a pier area with a dead end. He smashes into some boxes, seeing the police behind him. The skinnier officer gets on the bullhorn.)

OFFICER #1: This is the police! Pull your vehicle over and step out! Stop your vehicle. Put your hands on the roof and freeze!

(He turns around and sees the car coming towards him. He gets out. Nearly stumbling over a box, he runs to the fence behind him and jumps up. The heavier officer hits him in the back of the knee with the nightstick, sending him falling.)

Hold it!

(The suspect tries to get up but is met with more nightstick shots to the back.)

OFFICER #2: Get down there!

OFFICER #1: On the ground! Do it!

(The fatter one continues to prod him with it.)

OFFICER #2: Did you hear me?

OFFICER #1: Face down! Do it!

OFFICER #2: Stay there! Get down!

(A second police car pulls up. The suspect shrugs off the last shot to the head and grabs the first officer's nightstick. He swings it into his kneecap, nearly shattering it. The officer goes down in pain. A third officer gets out as the man drives the nightstick into the fat officer's gut, then smashes him in the face with it. The cop flies back into some boxes. The third officer runs to their aid, only to be greeted with a blow to the chest. A fourth officer, a young man, gets out and aims his taser at the man, who looks on his shock. The two conductors fly out and hit the man on his chest. He simply looks at them and pulls them out, then runs up a flight of stairs for boats. Two more cars pull up.)

OFFICER #4: Stop! Armed officer!

(The fourth officer takes out his gun and shoots the man in the side. He flinches. The officer shoots at him again as the man jumps off the stairs and into the water an incredible distance. The fourth officer and another one run up and look at the rippling water.)

I hit him. I know I hit him. Where the hell did he go? He'd be bleeding bad.

(The fourth officer notices some strange green spots on the last step. They look at each other, confused.)





SCENE 2
SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1994
(Mulder is asleep on his couch. The TV is playing. Two scientists are talking in the show.)

MAN #1: ...off the coast of Italy.

MAN #2: But, but theirs is a very light larvae.

MAN #1: That's exactly what stumped me. Because inside there must be something, the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.

MAN #2: But, professor, that... that would be Icelandic peridotite.

MAN #1: Precisely.

MAN #2: There's a piece chipped off.

MAN #1: By me.

MAN #2: Well, what, what's the rock inside?

MAN #1: Icelandic peridotite, naturally.

(The phone rings. Mulder wakes up.)

When I saw this, I stopped chipping.

MAN #2: In a rock from Iceland?

(Mulder picks up the phone.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Deep Throat, at an unknown dark location.)

DEEP THROAT: Are you watching channel eight?

(Deep Throat hangs up. Mulder hangs up the phone and sits up.)

MAN #2: ...across the world.

MAN #1: What's your conclusion?

MAN #2: Science does not jump to conclusions. Science is not a guessing game...

(Mulder changes the channel to channel eight, where the news is on. They are at the pier where the man jumped in.)

FEMALE REPORTER: ...Shipworks, where a sixty-mile high speed car chase ended early this evening. The suspect eluded capture by leaping into the harbor but not before reportedly injuring several Ardis officers.

(Mulder takes a video tape and puts into the VCR, then presses record.)

We have Captain Roy Lacerio standing by. Captain? How was the man able to escape and how seriously injured were the officers involved?

LACERIO: Those details are still unclear, I'll be talking with several of the off...

(A man comes over.)

MAN: We need you, Captain.

LACERIO: I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.

FEMALE REPORTER: Captain Roy Lacerio here being pulled away during an intense manhunt.

(Lacerio walks past a number of people, a few of which are not police officers and are wearing trenchcoats. Mulder rewinds the tape.)

Captain Roy Lacerio here being pulled away during an intense...




SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(He pauses the tape.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you've been through this tape a hundred times. What exactly are you hoping to find?

MULDER: I don't know.

(He presses a button on a machine and a picture prints out of the current shot. It is of the various men in trenchcoats as Lacerio walks by. He looks at the picture. A man in the front is very evident.)

SCULLY: And all he told you to was to watch channel eight?

MULDER: Yeah, that's all he said.

SCULLY: Do we even know why the suspect was being chased?

MULDER: As far as I can tell, he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation.

SCULLY: Well, that ought to put him in the Ten Most Wanted list.

MULDER: There's got to be something here. Some detail. Something we're not seeing.

(He prints out a picture of the silver Ciera the suspect was driving. Scully looks at it.)

SCULLY: How do you know he's not just yanking your chain, this Deep Throat character?

MULDER: Why would he do that?

SCULLY: Well, he has lied to you by his own admission.

MULDER: I don't think he'd call if there wasn't something here... something I was supposed to see. Something he wants me to see.

SCULLY: Then what are you missing?




SCENE 4
SHIPWORKS; ARLIS, MARYLAND
(Lacerio looks at the picture of the various people as Mulder and Scully look at him. Various people talk to each other in the background. Lacerio gives the picture back.)

LACERIO: Well, I don't know if you were aware but there were three different law enforcement agencies out here last night.

MULDER: Hunting a man on a moving violation?

LACERIO: I know it's not "Silence of the Lambs," but it's what we do.

MULDER: The man in the photograph doesn't appear to be wearing a badge or a uniform. He's not one of yours?

LACERIO: No, sir. But like I said, it was a zoo out here.

MULDER: You say the suspect was shot.

(They look at a scuba diver falling backwards off of a boat, searching the water.)

Any explanation why the body hasn't been recovered?

LACERIO: Well, has you can see, we've got our search ongoing. Divers' down there in shifts. We're quite certain he'll be found.

MULDER: It's been almost eighteen hours, Captain. Where could the body be?

LACERIO: Well, there are cables and debris all over the bottom. It's a painstaking business. Can I ask what the F.B.I.'s interest in this case would be?

(Scully looks at Mulder.)

MULDER: The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive.

LACERIO: Really? How's that? No description of the suspect has been released.

(Mulder looks away, slightly embarrassed.)

MULDER: If you don't mind, can we take a look at the car, please?

LACERIO: It's been taken to impound.




SCENE 5
IMPOUND
(Scully looks at a folder as Mulder is sitting in the front seat of the car.)

SCULLY: The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency in Gaithersburg. They had no idea that the car was even missing. You know, Mulder, I think that we're wasting our time here.

(Mulder gets out.)

MULDER: I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to find.

(He picks up the pictures, which he accidentally dropped, and moves to the front of the car.)

You can't make out the license plate in this photo.

(He leans up against the red van in back of him. He looks at the picture again, then at Scully, who is reaching through the car window.)

Hey, Scully, look at this.

SCULLY: What?

(She walks around to him.)

MULDER: Look at the car in this photo. Look at the windshield.

(She looks at the photo and sees there is a sticker on the windshield. The car in front of them does not have it.)

SCULLY: It's not the same car.

(Mulder shakes his head.)




SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Scully looks at the picture of the windshield and the sticker under a magnifying glass.)

SCULLY: It's called a caduceus. It's sort of the adopted symbol of the medical profession.

MULDER: So, probably, only a doctor would have that on his car.

SCULLY: Mm-hmmm. (in agreement.)

(Mulder fast-forwards the tape frame-by-frame. The quality looks to be better.)

MULDER: I had the picture enhanced and the plate is different. "3-A-Y-F."

SCULLY: Fast-forward.

MULDER: That's all you can make out. The rest is obscured.

(Scully advances the tape frame-by-frame as Mulder picks up the phone and dials someone's number.)

Hey, Danny, it's Mulder. I need you to run a Maryland plate for me. All I got is a partial. Registered to a doctor. Or used to be. Yeah, I'll hold.

(He looks at Scully, who notices something on the tape.)

They switched cars on us, Scully, and they lied about it.

SCULLY: Why would they do that?

MULDER: Maybe the, uh, real owner of the car has got something to hide.




SCENE 7
EMGEN CORPORATION; GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND
(Doctor Berube pours some reddish liquid into a container from an Erlenmeyer flask and closes the lid. His hands are in side a glass case with gloves on. Monkeys squeal in the back. Mulder and Scully walk in.)

MULDER: Doctor Berube?

BERUBE: Yes?

(Mulder walks over to him and shows him his badge.)

MULDER: We're with the F.B.I., can we have a minute of your time?

BERUBE: I'm actually very busy.

MULDER: I'm sorry. Are you aware that a car registered to you was involved in a high-speed chase in Arlis yesterday?

BERUBE: Excuse me?

MULDER: A silver Ciera, doctor. Do you own a silver Ciera?

BERUBE: Yes. It was used for what?

MULDER: A crime. Were you aware that it was even missing?

BERUBE: Not until you mentioned it. I have a housekeeper and she often uses the car.

(Scully looks at a monkey in a cage next to her.)

It's a second car...

(Scully taps the cage bars and the monkey lunges at her fingers. Scully pulls her hand away as Berube and Mulder look at her. Other monkeys start making noises again.)

Please! They should not be excited. Nothing should be touched.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, I thought they were friendly.

BERUBE: They're part of an experiment.

MULDER: What kind of experiment?

BERUBE: Am I under some kind of suspicion?

MULDER: No.

BERUBE: Then I think I've answered all your questions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more work than time.

MULDER: Thank you.

(He and Scully walk out. They stop outside the door.)

Did he bite you?

SCULLY: No, but he tried to.

(Mulder looks at his watch.)

MULDER: Well, IT'S ALMOST 5:00. We should check with the doctor's housekeeper about the car while we're out here.

(He starts off.)

SCULLY: No.

(Mulder stops and looks back at her.)

MULDER: "No?" What do you mean, "no?"

SCULLY: I mean, this has reached the point of absurdity, Mulder. We're out here on half a hunch off of a cryptic phone call chasing down a, a clue that's based on nothing but speculation.

MULDER: Well, that's all we've got.

SCULLY: That's all he's given us. Who is this Deep Throat character? I mean, we don't know anything about him. What his name is, what he does...

MULDER: He's in a delicate position. He has access to information and indiscretion could expose him.

SCULLY: You don't know that this isn't just a game with him. He's toying with you. Rationing out the facts.

MULDER: You think he does it because he gets off on it?

SCULLY: No. I think he does it because you do.

(She walks into the ladies' room, stopping and looking back at him for a moment.)




SCENE 8
MULDER'S APARTMENT
(Mulder gets out of his car and starts walking to his building. Deep Throat walks up behind him.)

DEEP THROAT: Calling it a night, Mister Mulder?

MULDER: My mother usually likes me home before the street lights come on.

(Deep Throat walks up to him and they start walking.)

DEEP THROAT: I'm surprised at you.

MULDER: Why?

DEEP THROAT: Your level of commitment seems to have diminished.

MULDER: My level of commitment?

DEEP THROAT: I should have expected that you'd be working through the night trying to put the pieces together.

MULDER: Well, maybe if you'd given me something more to work with.

DEEP THROAT: Under the circumstances, I've given you all I can.

MULDER: A news report?

DEEP THROAT: And where has it led you?

MULDER: Not very far.

(Deep Throat chuckles a little.)

DEEP THROAT: It may be further than you realized.

(Mulder stops in front of him.)

MULDER: You know, from day one, this has always been on your terms. I've gone along. Been the dutiful son. But maybe this time, we can just cut out the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap and you can save me the trouble.

DEEP THROAT: I fear you've become to dependent on me.

MULDER: Let me tell you something. I've got plenty to do without chasing down your vague leads or trying to decode your circular logic. Maybe it's you who's become too dependent on me... on my willingness to play your games.

(Mulder starts off.)

DEEP THROAT: Mister Mulder?

(Mulder turns back.)

MULDER: What?

(Deep Throat walks up to him.)

DEEP THROAT: Don't give up on this one. Trust me. You've never been closer.

MULDER: Closer to what?

(Deep Throat sighs and walks away. Mulder sighs.)




SCENE 9
EMGEN CORPORATION; GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND
(Berube sits at his desk, looking through a microscope. A monkey rolls around in his cage and squeaks. Berube looks at him for a second, then goes back to his work. The door unlocks and a man walks in, remaining in the shadows.)

BERUBE: Hello? Hello? Who's there?

CREW-CUT MAN: Working late tonight, doctor?

(Berube stands.)

BERUBE: What do you want here?

(The man steps partially into the light. He is the Crew-Cut Man, and he is the man in Mulder's picture.)

CREW-CUT MAN: He's alive, isn't he? Has he contacted you?

BERUBE: Please. You're going to have to leave.

(The Crew-Cut Man bangs on the cages, sending the monkeys screaming. Berube runs over to him.)

If you're from the F.B.I., I've already answered all your questions!

(The Crew-Cut Man walks over to Berube's desk.)

CREW-CUT MAN: What questions?

BERUBE: I had nothing to say to them. I have nothing to say to you.

CREW-CUT MAN: Where's Doctor Secare?

BERUBE: I don't know what you're talking about.

(The Crew-Cut Man chuckles to himself slightly. Berube walks over to him.)

Please. My work is very important. I must get on with my work.

CREW-CUT MAN: I'm afraid...

(He turns and faces Berube.)

Your work is done.

(Sounds of equipment breaking, glass falling and Berube groaning as the monkeys run around their cages, screaming.




SCENE 10
SHIPWORKS; ARLIS, MARYLAND
(The men on the boat talk.)

MAN #1: Anybody see anything?

MAN #2: No.

(The scuba diver pops out of the water. Lacerio and a few other people watch on the shore.)

SCUBA DIVER: Nothing!

LACERIO: That's it. I'm calling it off. Get those guys out of the water.

(He walks off. Another man takes out his walkie-talkie.)

OFFICER: Yes, sir. Shore to R.C. One, bring it in.

(The men on the boat pull the scuba diver out of the water. )

MAN #1: Visibility...

(They talk as the boat starts moving.)

MAN #2: ...been down there for two days. Forget it.

(As they drive by, they do not notice Doctor Secare sticking his head out of the water and looking around.)




SCENE 11
EMGEN CORPORATION; GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND
(Scully is reading the folder and Mulder stands next to her. In the photos, there are pictures of Berube lying face down, a roll of medical gauze around his neck. The next one is from a different angle, and the next is somebody's hand holding the medical gauze that is tied around his neck with another man pointing to a knot near is neck. Berube's shirt is open. The fourth picture is an even further close-up of the third. The final picture is of broken flasks covering the floor. Various policemen, agents and men in suits are in the background. The room is in shambles.)

SCULLY: The county sheriff's office is conducting the investigation. On the preliminary reports, it's being listed as a suicide.

MULDER: Suicide?

SCULLY: Yeah, they think that for whatever reason, he trashed his lab and then killed himself.

MULDER: How?

(He walks over to a desk with some glass containers on it. Scully follows.)

SCULLY: Well, it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze around his neck and the other end to this gas outlet.

(She puts her hand on a gas outlet that has medical gauze tied around it.)

Then he jumped.

MULDER: I don't suppose there were any witnesses?

SCULLY: Nope.

MULDER: The man we met yesterday kept this place like he was waiting for the people from Good Housekeeping to show up. I would have never pegged him as someone to do all this... or a Greg Louganis out the window.

(He looks out the broken window next to him.)

SCULLY: I know, that gauze is troubling.

MULDER: It's a bit too calculated, huh?

(He holds the gauze.)

Almost as if someone wanted to make doubly sure he'd break his neck before he hit the ground.

(He throws the gauze away and starts walking. Scully follows.)

What else do we know about Doctor Berube?

SCULLY: Ummm... "Terrence Allen Berube. Harvard Med., 1974." He was working on the Human Genome Project. Are you familiar with that?

MULDER: Yeah. The mapping of all human genes. Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor in the history of mankind.

(He walks past her.)

SCULLY: Right, but there's nothing extraordinary about that. I mean, there were thousands of scientists working on that project.

(Mulder looks at a glass, then puts it down.)

MULDER: Yeah, but only one who owned a silver Ciera and went bungie-jumping with medical gauze wrapped around his neck.

(Mulder opens up a metal case.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder. I'm seeing the pieces but I'm not seeing the connection.

(He takes out the Erlenmeyer flask containing the red liquid. It has a label on the bottom that reads "Purity Control.")

MULDER: Well, maybe that's just it. Maybe we're not seeing it because it can't be seen, not in any obvious way. What do you think this is?

SCULLY: I don't know.

MULDER: Well, can you find out for me?

(Scully sighs and takes the vial.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: I'll see what else I can find out about Doctor Terrance Allen Berube.

SCULLY: Okay, Mulder, but I'm warning you... if this is monkey pee, you're on your own.




SCENE 12
6:30 P.M.
(Mulder pulls up to Berube's house. He gets out of the car and rings The doorbell twice. He takes a piece of mail that reads:

"Dr. T.A. Berube
2650 W. 1st
Ardis Maryland
149376"

He goes back to the door, then walks around the side of the house. He sees that a window to the cellar is open and he climbs inside.)




SCENE 13
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY; MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT
(Dr. Carpenter, a woman who works there, feeds a sample of the bacteria into a machine with a microscope. Scully stands next to the computer.)

CARPENTER: My first impression is it's some kind of bacteria sample. Can I ask you where you got it?

SCULLY: It was recovered at a crime scene.

CARPENTER: Well, we've come a long way from Colonel Mustard in the den with the rope, haven't we?

(Scully laughs as Carpenter types.)

SCULLY: No, I'm expecting it to turn out to be nothing.

(Carpenter looks at the computer screen.)

CARPENTER: No... no, you've definitely got something here.

(There are a few white balls on the screen which have little holes, looking like some sort of bacteria. She zooms in.)

Wow... look at this.

(It zooms in slowly.)

SCULLY: What are they?

CARPENTER: Well, they're the size of bacteria but no bacteria I've ever seen.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

CARPENTER: Well, most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth. These are... I don't know.
It's strange.

SCULLY: You have no way of identifying them?

CARPENTER: Well, we could do a freeze fracture. Take a thin slice off and see what's going on inside these babies. If you don't mind waiting.

SCULLY: No, no, I'll wait.




SCENE 14
7:45 P.M.
(Mulder turns on Berube's desk lamp and sits down in his chair. He opens up a drawer and looks through the files. Stopping at a telephone bill, he takes it out and sees that there are many calls to the same number: "(301) 555-2804." He picks up the phone and starts dialing.)

MULDER: Hi, Danny. Yeah, it's Mulder again. Look, I got a number this time. 555-2804. Area code 301. I need an address, a name if you can get it for me. All right, I'm at... same prefix... fifteen-seventeen. All right, thanks, Danny.

(He hangs up and puts the telephone bill away. A white van pulls up outside the house. Mulder opens up the top drawer and pulls out a set of keys. He pockets them and the phone rings. Outside, the Crew-Cut Man sits in the front seat, headphones on, a satellite dish in hand to pick up the phone call. Mulder picks up the phone.)

That was fast.

SECARE: Terry? Is that you?

(Mulder pauses.)

MULDER: Yeah. Who's this?

(Cut to Secare, standing at a phone booth.)

SECARE: They shot me, Terry. Oh, God.

(Cut to the Crew-Cut Man, who listens intently.)

I've been in the water for three days. I'm hurt.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Where are you now?

(Cut to Secare.)

SECARE: I'm at a pay phone.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I'm going to pick you up. Where are you?

(Cut to Secare, who grabs his bulletwound in pain. A man in a leather jacket walks by.)

SECARE: Terry...

(He slumps down against the glass. The man stops.)

MULDER: Hello?

MAN: Are you okay?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Are you there? Hello?

(Cut to the man, who takes the phone.)

MAN: Hello? This man's been hurt here. I, I think he needs medical attention.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

He's in pretty bad shape...

MULDER: What's the street? What's the street?

(Cut to the man.)

MAN: I'm gonna call an ambulance.

MULDER: Sir?

(The man hangs up. Cut to Mulder, who slams the phone down in anger. He stands and the phone rings. He picks up and sits down.)

Don't hang up.

DANNY: I got it.

MULDER: Hi, Danny.

(The Crew-Cut Man takes off his headphones.)

Let me get the address...

DANNY: All right, you ready?

(Mulder reaches over and takes some paper. As he does, he sees the white van.)

Mulder?

MULDER: I'm just writing it down now, go ahead.

(The van speeds off.)

DANNY: All right, the number belongs to a company called Zeus Storage.

MULDER: Yeah...

DANNY: Sixteen-sixteen...

MULDER: Sixteen...

(Mulder writes this down.)

DANNY: Pandora Street.

MULDER: Sixteen... Pandora Street.

DANNY: That's it.

MULDER: All right, thanks.

(Danny hangs up. Mulder does right after.)




SCENE 15
MARYLAND
(An ambulance speeds down a road carrying Secare, who does not have a shirt on.. A man is pumping an oxygen mask over his mouth while another is talking to headphones.)

MAN: All right, we've got a white male, forty, weak vitals and signs of severe dysnea and hypertension. He also has what appears to be a green fluid coming from a wound in his right upper quadrant.

(The other man takes off the oxygen pump and starts taping the wound.)

MAN AT HOSPITAL: I don't know what the hell that is. Is he responding to ventilation?

MAN: No and we're noticing those rope veins at the neck and a hypersonant sounding chest. He's going real blue on us now.

MAN AT HOSPITAL: Okay, you've got a tension to a thorax. I want you to perform a thorachotomy and release the pressure in his chest.

(The man turns to the other man.)

MAN: Okay, we're going to need a cannula. We're going to do a needle decompression.

(The second paramedic hands the first one a needle and a cannula. Secare's head lifts up as the paramedic pushes the needle in. He looks at the two as air rushes out and they cringe, holding their eyes. The second man coughs. The ambulance swerves off the road.)

MAN AT HOSPITAL: Mobile van, what's going on?

(The driver falls out of the car. Secare plucks the needle out.)

Mobile van, can you hear me?

(Secare opens the doors and runs out.)

Mobile van, answer me! Mobile van, what is the problem? Mobile van, come in please!




SCENE 16
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY; MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT
(Scully is calling Mulder. It's ringing.)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: It's me.

(Cut to Mulder, who is driving.)

MULDER: He's alive, Scully.

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: The fugitive, the driver of the silver Ciera. He called the doctor's house while I was there.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Where is he now?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I don't know. Where are you?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department.

(She sighs.)

I've got something for you.

MULDER: Is it smaller than a silver Ciera?

(She walks over to Carpenter, who is sitting at a computer.)

SCULLY: Much. And it's not silver, it's green.

MULDER: What is it?

(On the computer, there is a picture of the freeze fracture. It is green with little blue spots.)

SCULLY: Some kind of bacteria, each containing virus and it looks as if Berube may have been cloning them.

(Cut to Mulder.)

They also contain something that looks like chloroplasts...

(Cut to Scully.)

Plant cells. But they, they've never seen anything like it here.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Any idea what he could have been doing with them?

SCULLY: Well, the only reason why you clone a virus inside a bacteria...

(Cut to Scully.)

...is in order to inject it into something living. It's called gene therapy and it's still highly experimental.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, maybe that's what he was doing with those monkeys. Can they tell you anything else there?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, they're just about to run some primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence.

(She walks away from Carpenter.)

Now, I may be understating the strangeness of this, Mulder. Bacteria like this... it may have existed, but not for millions of years, not since before our ancestors first crawled out of the sea.

(Cut to Mulder, who pulls up at Zeus Storage.)

Are you there, Mulder?

(Mulder does not answer.)

Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, Scully. Keep up the good work.

(Cut to Scully. She exhales sharply, feeling cast away.)




SCENE 17
ZEUS STORAGE
(Mulder walks in and down a flight of stairs. He sees a number of doors. He looks through the keys and sees one marked "1056." Walking to the door with the same number, he unlocks it and slides the door open. Inside, he sees five glass cases, like aquariums, each hooked up to various computers. Inside each case is a naked man, perfectly still. As he walks past them, he looks at them in disbelief. Suddenly, one of them moves. Mulder realizes that they are all alive and breathing underwater.)




SCENE 18
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY; MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT; 11:45 P.M.
(Scully is sleeping on a couch in the employee's lounge. Dr. Carpenter walks in and closes the door. She nudges Scully on the shoulder.)

CARPENTER: Agent Scully?

(Scully wakes up.)

SCULLY: Oh, Doctor Carpenter. I fell asleep.

(Dr. Carpenter sits down next to Scully. She holds out a piece of paper that has a pattern of dashes up and down the paper until a point where they become sparser.)

CARPENTER: I've done some work. These are the DNA sequences from the bacteria sample you brought in. You seem to know something about molecular biology. Do you know what you're looking at?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think those are genes.

CARPENTER: Right. They're called base pairs. Each pair is made up of something called a nucleotide. Only four nucleotides exist in DNA. Four. And through some miracle of design that we have yet to fathom, every living thing is created out of these four basic building blocks. What you're
looking at is a sequence of genes from the bacteria sample. Normally, we'd find no gaps in the sequence. But with these bacteria, we do.

SCULLY: Why is that?

CARPENTER: I don't know why. But I tell you, under any other circumstances, my first call would have been to the government.

SCULLY: What exactly did you find?

CARPENTER: A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide. A new base pair. Agent Scully, what are you looking at... it exists nowhere in nature. IT would have to be, by definition... extraterrestrial.




SCENE 19
ZEUS STORAGE
(Mulder walks out of the building and sees a white van pull up. Two men get out. He starts walking the other way and sees that they are following him. A third man comes running at him. He runs down an alley and jumps the fence. He runs down that side of the alley as fast as he can until he turns a corner, stops and draws his gun. Seeing no one, he runs the other way.)




SCENE 20
MULDER'S APARTMENT
(It is morning. Mulder walks in and sees his phone is ringing.)

MULDER: Hello.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Where on God's earth have you been? I've been trying to call you all night.

MULDER: I had a situation. I left my phone in the car.

SCULLY: Mulder... that bacteria I had analyzed... they're saying that it doesn't exist in nature.

(Cut to Mulder, who sits down.)

They're saying that it could be extraterrestrial.

MULDER: Scully...

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: How soon can you be here? There's something I got to show you.




SCENE 21
7:30 A.M.
(Mulder and Scully pull up. A car is parked out front. Mulder walks to the building and Scully follows.)

SCULLY: Wait a second... Mulder?

(He stops.)

I, I just want to say that I was wrong.

MULDER: It's all right, don't worry about it.

SCULLY: No, um... if you'd had listened to me, we wouldn't be here right now. I should know by now to trust your instincts.

MULDER: Why? Nobody else does.

(She smiles.)

SCULLY: You know, I've always held science as sacred. I've, I've always put my trust in the accepted facts. And what I saw last night... for the first time in my life, I don't know what to believe.

MULDER: Well, whatever it is you do believe, Scully... when you walk into that room? Nothing sacred will hold.

(He looks at her and walks in. She follows. Downstairs, he unlocks the sliding door and walks in, flicking on the switch. The room is completely barren except for a table. He walks to the middle of the room and she follows.)

There were tanks here and five bodies suspended in solution. There were computers monitoring them. They were alive, Scully, underwater.

SCULLY: What happened to them?

DEEP THROAT: God only knows.

(They turn to see Deep Throat standing in the doorway, carrying an envelope. He walks over to them.)

Most likely, they've been destroyed.

(He looks at Scully and nods to her.)

Miss Scully. I believe we met ever so briefly.

MULDER: Destroyed by whom?

DEEP THROAT: I don't know.

MULDER: I don't believe you.

DEEP THROAT: There are limits to my knowledge, Mister Mulder. Inside the intelligence community, there are so-called "black organizations." Groups within groups conducting covert activities, unknown at the highest levels of power.

MULDER: There were three men last night, I was chased.

DEEP THROAT: Hmmm. If you were chased, you would have been killed. Those men are trained for that sort of business and they are trained well.

SCULLY: Were those the same men who killed Doctor Berube?

DEEP THROAT: Presumably.

SCULLY: Why?

DEEP THROAT: "Why?" Good lord, you've worked so hard and you still don't see it.

MULDER: Doctor Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial viruses.

DEEP THROAT: Yes, but that's been going on for years. We've had the tissue since 1947 but not the technology.

MULDER: Roswell?

DEEP THROAT: Roswell was a smoke screen, we've had a half-a-dozen better salvage operations. Doctor Berube was killed because his work was too successful. You're standing in the room where the first DNA transplant took, the first human-alien hybrid was created.

(He puts the envelope down on the table and opens it up, spreading pictures over the table.)

Six volunteer patients, all terminally ill.

(He holds up a picture of Secare.)

One, Doctor William Secare, an old friend of Doctor Berube's, was dying of melanoma cancer. And as a result of the E.T. gene therapy, all six patients treated in this room began to recover from their illnesses. Doctor Secare was able to live a more or less normal life. As normal as possible for a man who has developed inhuman strength and the ability to breathe underwater.

(Mulder starts to walk around.)

MULDER: That's how he was able to elude capture.

DEEP THROAT: Hmmm. (in agreement.)

SCULLY: What was he running from?

DEEP THROAT: Doctor Secare was never supposed to have survived. Doctor Berube's research was part of a top secret government project being run out of Los Alamos. All they were interested in was the technology, the science. To have a hybrid living out in the real world? Too great a liability. What if he should need emergency medical procedure? The man has a blood chemistry that is alien and very likely toxic. That story should hit the press.

MULDER: It was just easier to kill Doctor Secare.

DEEP THROAT: Of course, there was only one problem. He was Doctor Berube's old friend and he was able to warn him.

SCULLY: There's just one thing I don't understand. Why you gave us so little to go on in the beginning and why are you giving us so much now?

DEEP THROAT: I didn't anticipate the speed and precision of their clean-up operation. They're systematically destroying all the evidence... Doctor Berube, the bodies here. Without the evidence, you two have no case. Who would believe the story I just told you? You must put together everything that you have found and you must find Doctor Secare before they do. I'll have no further contact with you on this matter.

(He walks out. Mulder and Scully look at each other. After, they walk out.)

SCULLY: I'm going to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work.

MULDER: I'm going to find Doctor Secare.

SCULLY: Where?

MULDER: I don't know. I'm going to trust my instincts.




SCENE 22
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY
(Scully walks into the employee's lounge and sees various female doctor lounging around, drinking coffee, eating lunch and reading.)

SCULLY: Excuse me? I'm looking for Doctor Ann Carpenter. I've been unable to reach her by phone and she's not in her office.

WOMAN: She was in a terrible car accident, her whole family. And Doctor Carpenter is, um... dead.




SCENE 23
BERUBE RESIDENCE; ARDIS, MARYLAND
(Mulder unlocks the front door and goes inside. He looks around and hears a thump from upstairs. He draws his gun and slowly walks up the stairs, waiting before turning each corner. Another thump comes from the attic door above him. He goes up and looks around the dark room.)

MULDER: Doctor Secare?

(He starts walking to the back of the attic when Secare jumps out from behind him and tackles him into the wall, knocking the gun out of his hand.)

Wait!

(Secare punches him, literally sending him flying across the room into a pile of boxes. Secare picks him up by his trenchcoat.)

I'll protect you.

(Secare looks at him strangely. A gunshot sounds and Secare's head jerks back. He falls to the floor, letting Mulder see the Crew-Cut Man standing up through the doorway, gun in hand and gas mask on. Mulder looks down at Secare and sees that he has been shot in the back of the neck, green ooze fizzing out. He gasps in pain and starts holding his eyes, coughing. He falls to his knees. Later, Mulder lies on the floor, hands and feet tied. His phone is ringing. Two men in the back carry the doctor's body down the stairs, both wearing gas masks. The Crew-Cut Man walks over, kneels next to Mulder, and takes off his gas mask. Mulder's eyelids, nose and mouth are inflamed.)

CREW-CUT MAN: Your cellular phone's been ringing off the hook.

MULDER: I'm a popular guy. Why don't you answer it for me?

CREW-CUT MAN: Oh, I don't like talking on the phone. I have this thing about unsecured lines. When you feel like talking, let me know, though.




SCENE 24
MULDER'S APARTMENT; 6:10 A.M.
(Scully pulls up and gets out of the car. She walks over to the door and presses the button to the buzzer in Mulder's apartment. Deep Throat walks around the column and looks at her.)

DEEP THROAT: He's not home.

(She looks at him.)

SCULLY: Where is he? He's been gone all night.

DEEP THROAT: I wish I knew.

SCULLY: Something's happened to him.

DEEP THROAT: They won't kill him.

SCULLY: How do you know that?

DEEP THROAT: He's become too high-profile and you've got evidence that could expose them.

SCULLY: I don't have any evidence. They took the evidence and they may have killed in order to get it.

DEEP THROAT: Listen to me. Evidence still exists.

SCULLY: Where?

DEEP THROAT: It might be difficult to obtain but with your medical background, I might be able to get you inside.

SCULLY: Inside where?

DEEP THROAT: The high containment facility at Fort Marlene, Maryland.

SCULLY: What do they have there?

DEEP THROAT: The wellspring, Miss Scully. The original tissue. If they've got Agent Mulder, they might be willing to make a deal. It could save his life.




SCENE 25
FORT MARLENE; HIGH CONTAINMENT FACILITY
(Scully walks in carrying a briefcase, an I.D. attached to her trenchcoat. Two doctors walk up to a guard in front of a door. The guard checks one of their credentials and pushes a button, opening the door. The first doctor walks out. Scully looks up at the video camera positioned above the door.
The second doctor leaves and Scully walks up to the guard. She shows him her I.D. which reads:

"6D
Dana Scully, MD
26-38-90 Class A
Bio-Medical Division"

There is a picture of her next to the writing.)

GUARD: Clear.

(He pushes the button and the door opens. She walks through and turns right. A man closes a filing cabinet and walks past her. He looks back at her for a second, then keeps walking. Scully looks back at the man and puts the briefcase in the other hand. She walks past a few more doctors until she reaches the elevator. The board next to it reads:

"Level 7 Cryology
Level 6 Virology
Level 5 Oncology
Level 4 Radiology
Level 3 Immunology
Level 2 Toxicology
Level 1 Admin
Level G Security"

She plucks the I.D. off her trenchcoat and runs it through the keycard sensor. The machine beeps and the doors slide opens. She walks in and pushes a button. The doors close. On the seventh floor, she walks out of the elevator and to a door with a sign that says "Cryology." She slides her I.D. through the keycard sensor, which beeps. She opens the door and closes it behind her. She slides her I.D. through the next keycard sensor, which beeps a different way and does not switch from a green light to a red light. There is a speaker above the sensor. A guard speaks through it.)

GUARD: Name?

(She looks at the speaker, then walks over to the glass pane. She sees the guard sitting there.)

SCULLY: Dana Scully.

GUARD: Company or institution?

SCULLY: Federal government.

GUARD: Project password?

(He takes a pen and prepares to write something down. Her face goes blank, she looks at the alarm bell, then at the video camera. The guard looks at her and presses the intercom button again.)

Project password?

(She thinks back.)

SCULLY: Purity control.

(He writes it down, then starts tapping number out on a keypad. The door unlocks. She opens it and walks over to the guard.)

GUARD: Log in, please?

(He holds up a clipboard, which she signs. She walks through an open door down a hallway past a number of canisters. Wearing rubber gloves now, she opens a door marked "Purity Control." She slides out the nitrogen canister and takes off the lid. Reaching in, she pulls out a metal container with glass all around it. It contains a small alien fetus-like creature.)




SCENE 26
BRIDGE
(Scully sits in her car on the bridge, waiting. Another car drives up behind her. She gets out of the car, carrying a box that presumably contains the evidence. Walking over to the door, Deep Throat rolls down the window.)

SCULLY: You're late.

DEEP THROAT: Do you have it?

SCULLY: Yes.

DEEP THROAT: Good. They're willing to make the exchange.

SCULLY: You spoke to them?

DEEP THROAT: Yes.

(He reaches out his window.)

I'll take the parcel.

SCULLY: No, sir. I'll make the exchange.

(He pulls his hand back in.)

DEEP THROAT: I made the deal, Scully, they're expecting me.

SCULLY: I don't trust you.

DEEP THROAT: You've got no one else to trust.

SCULLY: I don't know who you are. I know nothing about you.

DEEP THROAT: Oh, for God's sake, don't screw this up! Let me tell you something you should know. In 1987, a group of children from a southern state were given what their parents thought was a routine inoculation. What they were injected with was a clone DNA from the contents of that package you're holding as a test. That's the kind of people you're dealing with!

SCULLY: So why give it back to them?

DEEP THROAT: To save Mulder's life.

SCULLY: At the risk of so many other lives?

DEEP THROAT: Oh, it's the tip of the iceberg. You and Mulder are the only ones who can bring it to light.

(He reaches out again.)

Now, give me the parcel.

(She stares at him, not knowing what to do. A white van pulls up in front of Scully's car.)

Give me the parcel, Scully.

(She hands him the package and runs back to her car. As the car passes her, she looks at the man driving the car. He is the Crew-Cut Man. He looks at her as he drives by. She gets in the car. The van pulls up next to Deep Throat's car. The two men step out of their cars as Scully breathes deeply, watching in her rear-view mirrors. Deep Throat hands the Crew-Cut Man the package. Scully turns around and watches through her back window. The Crew-Cut Man walks over to his open door, puts the package, turns around to face Deep Throat, and shoots him.)

SCULLY: No!

(Deep Throat falls to the ground. The back doors to the van open and a man pushes Mulder out onto the concrete. Scully runs towards the van with her gun in hand. She goes to Mulder as the van drives away.)

Mulder. Mulder!

(He groans. She checks his pulse and runs over to Deep Throat. She feels her neck and opens up his jacket, revealing the gunshot wound.)

DEEP THROAT: Trust...

(She lifts his head up so he can speak.)

Trust... no one.

(He exhales sharply. And with that, Deep Throat dies in Scully's arms.)




SCENE 27
WASHINGTON, D.C.; THIRTEEN DAYS LATER
(Scully is asleep on her bed. She wakes with a startle. Looking at the clock, which reads 11:21, she takes deep breaths. The phone rings and she picks it up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

MULDER: Hey, Scully. It's me.

SCULLY: Where are you?

(Cut to Mulder, sitting in his apartment with the lights off.)

They're shutting us down, Scully.

(Cut to Scully, who sits up.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: They called me in tonight...

(Cut to Mulder.)

...and they said they're going to reassign us to other sections.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Who said that?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Skinner.

(He spits out the word.)

He said word came down from the top...

(Cut to Scully.)

...of the executive branch.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Cut to Mulder, who still seems amazingly placid.)

MULDER: It's over, Scully.

(Cut back to Scully, who is in disbelief.)

SCULLY: Well, you have to lodge a protest. They can't...

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yes, they can.

(He nods to himself. Cut to Scully, who sits in silence for a few seconds.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: I'm... not going to give up. I can't give up. Not as long as the truth is out there.

(Cut to Scully, who hears a click. She lowers the phone from her ear.)




SCENE 28
HIDDEN ROOM; PENTAGON
(The Cigarette-Smoking Man turns a corner and walks through a narrow row of shelves in the same room that he hid the communications device taken out of Billy Miles so long ago. He walks over to a box that is labeled "Evidence, 16604." He holds up a jar that contains the alien fetus in it. He looks at it, then puts it in the box, which contains many others like it. He pushes the box back onto the shelf and walks all the way down the hallway. He walks out and closes the door, then runs his keycard through it's sensor. The sign on the door reads:

"In Case Of Fire Or Emergency
Know Your Exits
PENTAGON
Evacuation Procedure"

There is a map of the Pentagon next to it. The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks away.)

[THE END]
