INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but –

YOUNG WOMAN
– but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
– yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: "We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl – the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
"Empty out the register," and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
"Garcon" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?

"PULP FICTION"

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
– Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause – get a load of
this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King.  But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

CUT TO:

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem.  What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good.  And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his
place.  They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses – nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
– no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages – I'm the foot fuckin'
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage –
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed – this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

JULES
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be –

JULES
– I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that.  Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about "best
intentions."

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
"What" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in "What?"

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

JULES
Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"
again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say "What" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black –

JULES
– go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald –

JULES
– does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find – when all
this shit is over and done – I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine.  Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over.  In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his
cup of "Plain ol' American."

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril.  One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a
"Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce – those are friend
prices – but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went.  Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No.  You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman.  If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days – five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP – BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

CUT TO:

EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

CLOSEUP – NOTE

The Note reads:

"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside
and make yourself a drink.  Mia"

MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink.

FADE TO WHITE

Music in.

FADE TO:

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

VINCENT
Hello?

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in
the background. Dusty Springfield is singing "SON OF A
PREACHER MAN".

Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent turns.

MIA
(over intercom)
Vincent. I'm on the intercom.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

It's on the wall by the two African
fellas.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent walks.

MIA
...warm. Warmer. Disco.

Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.

VINCENT
Hello.

Push the button if you want to talk.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Hello.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
The bar's by the fireplace.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Okay.
(licks lips)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty
Springfield song continues.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video
camera in Marcellus' living room.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle,
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
the wall

("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
you please me."

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him –

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it –

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

VINCENT
What?

MIA
"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show "Baton Rouge," she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me.  We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist – when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: "Yes."

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding
– then never again.  The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle.

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN

Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest.

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face.

MIA
(like you would say
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
fat line.

CLOSEUP – MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening," go home, and
jack off.  And that's all you're
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
a number.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late.

BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin'  Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here!  I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it –
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up.

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone –

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
"Come on," endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room –

VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The
Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it
like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
in her chest – SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE
FIVE" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER."  Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together.  Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH
COOLIDGE".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,
empty locker room.

TITLE CARD:

"THE GOLD WATCH"

We hear over the black and white title:

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
– Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
brutal fight this city has ever seen.

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table –
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio – you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man –

BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star," it's not
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: "no."

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back!  Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese –

BUTCH
– where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
–

BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay?  Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. "Bedside table – on the
kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't
forget my father's watch."

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.

CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY – DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA – DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.

INT. HONDA – DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch.  They keep underestimatin'
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
gather around the body.

GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
–

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught
me –

MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business –

MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what
now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask – two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone.  You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says,
Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good –

BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk –
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men..."

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
"...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you."

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind?  Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that!  Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –

JULES
– I said don't do that –

VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
I just accidentally shot Marvin in
the throat.

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time –

VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight –

VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –

JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation –
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna
hear from your ass is: "you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly."

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100%.

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive?  Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe
down the upholstery – now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up.  But the
windows are a different story.  Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie –
lead the way, boys – get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A "please" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a "please" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say "please."I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin' –

THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore –

THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE – MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS
OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me.  Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless –

THE WOLF
– unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
I'd be great.  What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
"DEAD ZONE" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast.  Want to have breakfast
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ –

VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no
doubt about it – but it wasn't water
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here!  Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all –

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: "yes."

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: "yes."

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool.  When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous.  When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I.  It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet
with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you." I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
– wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

FADE OUT

THE END

FADE IN:

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
surround it.

CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
WORLD OF LIQUOR.

TITLE CARD:

BIG SPRING, TEXAS
109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and a
real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is in
full ranger uniform -- button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
off duty for the day.

The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth

INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a stool
behind the counter.

A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim glasses
holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and bare
feet. They look through magazines.

Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the beer
cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
seventeen.

MCGRAW enters the store.

MCGRAW
Hot goddamn day!

PETE
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside
with the air conditioner blastin'
all day long.

MCGRAW
Not even for lunch?

PETE
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
outta the microwave.

McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and joins
Pete by the front counter.

MCGRAW
Jesus Christ man, that microwave
food will kill ya as quick as a
bullet. Those burritos are only fit
for a hippie high on weed. Pull me
down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm
gettin' tanked tonight.

PETE
Whatsamatter?

MCGRAW
(sighs)
Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
Every inch of it hot and miserable.
First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
boy of hers was workin' the grill.
That fuckin' idiot don't know rat
shit from Rice Krispies. I ate
breakfast at nine, was pukin' up
pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by
ten thirty.

PETE
Isn't there a law or something against
retards serving food to the public?

MCGRAW
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
be. Who knows what goes on inside
Mongoloid's mind?

PETE
You could sue the shit out of her,
ya know. That kid belongs under a
circus tent, not flippin' burgers.
You could own that fuckin' place.

MCGRAW
What the hell would I do with that
grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
enough of a cross to bear just taking
care of that potato head. Then all
this Abilene shit happened. You heard
about that bank robbery in Abilene,
didn't ya?

PETE
That's all that's been on the box
all day. They killed some people
didn't they?

MCGRAW
Four Rangers, three cops, and two
civilians. And they took a lady bank
teller as a hostage.

Pete doesn't say anything.

MCGRAW
They'll probably make a run for the
border, which would bring 'em this
way. And if we get our hands on those
shit asses, we're talking payback
time. We'll get 'em all right. I
gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
commode.

PETE
Knock yourself out.

McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and exits
in the bathroom.

The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
We see that the girl is crying.

BLACK SUITED MAN #1
(to Pete)
Do you think I'm fuckin' playing
with you, asshole?
(points to the tearful
prep school girl)
Do you want this little girl to die?
(pointing to the blonde
with the other guy)
Or that little girl? Or your bosom
buddy with the badge? Or yourself? I
don't wanna do it, but I'll turn
this fuckin' store into the Wild
Bunch if I even think you're fuckin'
with me.

The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene bank
robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers." And
the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth is the
one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with the blonde.

Everybody speaks low and fast.

PETE
What do you want from me? I did what
you said.

SETH
Letting him use your toilet? No store
does that.

PETE
He comes in here every day and we
bullshit. He's used my toilet a
thousand times. If I told him no,
he'd know something was up.

SETH
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
here, in his car, and down the road
or you can change the name of this
place to "Benny's World of Blood."

Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
at Pete.

SETH
Were you giving that pig signals?

PETE
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
anything!

Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

SETH
He says you were scratching.

PETE
I wasn't scratching!

SETH
You callin' him a liar?

Pete controls himself.

PETE
I'm not calling him a liar, okay?
I'm simply saying that if I was
scratching, and if I did scratch,
it's not because I was signaling the
cop, it's because I'm fuckin' scared
shitless.

Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
Seth.

RICHARD
The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
I just go in there, blow his head
off and get outta here.

PETE
Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
act natural, and I'm acting as natural --
in fact, under the circumstances, I
think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
Award for how natural I'm acting.
You asked me to get rid of him, I'm
doing my best.

SETH
Yeah, well, your best better get a
helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
worse.

The toilet FLUSHES.

SETH
Everybody be cool.

Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
of the situation.

MCGRAW
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna
sit in front of the box and just
drink booze. How much is the bottle?

PETE
Six-fifty.

Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

McGraw goes down screaming.

Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

Seth charges forward.

SETH
(to Richard)
What the fuck was that about?

RICHARD
(in a low monotone)
He signaled the Ranger.

PETE
(hysterical)
I didn't.
(to Seth)
You gotta believe me, I didn't.

RICHARD
(to Seth)
When they were talkin', he mouthed
the words "Help Us."

PETE
You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

SETH
What the fuck is wrong with you --

RICHARD
Seth, he did it. You were by the
beer cooler with your back turned. I
was by the magazines, I could see
his face.  And I saw him mouth:

Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls out
a gun from it.

Seth releases his brother.

SETH
Start the car.

RICHARD
You believe me don't cha?

SETH
Shut up and start the car.

Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
the hand.

Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

The two girls have run out screaming.

SETH
(yelling)
Richie? You okay?

RICHARD
(yelling)
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely
shot! I told you that bastard said,
"Help us!"

PETE
(yelling)
I never said help us!

SETH
(yelling)
Well that don't matter now, 'cause
you got about two fuckin' seconds to
live! Richie!

RICHARD
(yelling)
Yeah?

SETH
(yelling)
When I count three, shoot out the
bottles behind him!

RICHARD
Gotcha!

SETH
One... Two... Three.

The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
RAIN down on him.

Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

Richard keeps FIRING.

Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

The fireball lands behind the counter.

The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
screams from behind the counter.

Seth smiles to himself and stands.

Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
still holding his weapon and FIRING.

Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
Pastry display.

Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.

EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
flames.

SETH
What did I tell you? What did I tell
you? Buy the road map and leave.

RICHARD
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He
recognized us.

SETH
He didn't recognize shit.

Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

RICHARD
Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
looked at us -- you especially -- I
knew he knew.

They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth starts
it up. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can hear Seth
mumbling under the motor.

SETH
Low profile. Do you know what the
words "low profile" mean?

CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
the street, and speeds off down the road.

We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust behind
it, as the store burns out of control.

OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

CUT TO:

EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY

The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

The rest of the titles play over black as the song continues.

CREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS

CUT TO:

EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
290.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':

FORT STOCKTON
238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER

INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's Vietnamese
adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid who always
wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal garage band
he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three of them are
wolfing down a late lunch.

JACOB
We got about two more hours of day
light left. That'll get us into El
Paso, which is right next to the
border. We'll stop at a motel --

SCOTT
Stop? We're not going to actually
stop at a motel, are we?

Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

SCOTT AND KATE
We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
those over priced roach havens. We're
self contained.

JACOB
Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
overzealous, but give me a break, I
just bought it.

Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

SCOTT
Why, just look at all this. You got
your kitchen --

KATE
-- you got your microwave --

SCOTT
-- you got your sink --

KATE
-- you got your shower --

SCOTT
-- see this, television!

KATE
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

JACOB
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
what say we drop this?

SCOTT
(to Kate)
The truth hurts.

KATE
(to Scott)
It's the bitterest of pills.

JACOB
You two ought to start a stand-up
act, because you're just wasting
your humor on me.

KATE
Ain't it the truth.

SCOTT
Why do you want to stop?

JACOB
I'm exhausted.

SCOTT
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
into Mexico.

Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
new motor home."

JACOB
I just bet you would. Don't even
think about it. Besides, I want to
have one night's sleep in an honest-
to-goodness bed. The beds in the
home are okay, but they're not like
a real bed.

KATE
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
swim.

SCOTT
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
the bathroom.

Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
restroom.

Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
silence before...

KATE
Dad, when I called the machine to
check our messages there was one
from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin
said he wouldn't permanently replace
you until we came back. He said when
we come home, if you still feel the
same way --

JACOB
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
call him tomorrow and tell him not
to bother waiting.

KATE
I didn't want to talk about this in
front of Scott because he gets upset.
But you don't believe in God anymore?

JACOB
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
know this is hard on you kids. After
Jenny's death, this is probably the
last thing you need. But I can't do
it any longer. My congregation needs
spiritual leadership. Well, they
can't get that from me anymore. My
faith is gone. To answer your
question, yes, I do believe in Jesus.
But do I love them? No. After Jenny
died, I just thought, what's the
point?

KATE
(pushing him)
It's just, all our lives you've been
a pastor. For twenty years you've
preached trust in the lord. And then
one day you wake up and say fuck
him?

JACOB
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
connected anymore.

KATE
That happens, you'll get it back.

JACOB
Kate, give your old man a little
credit. Every person who chooses the
service of God as their life's work
has something in common. I don't
care if you're a preacher, a priest,
a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk.
Many, many times during your life
you'll look at your reflection in
the mirror and ask yourself, am I a
fool? We've all done it. I'm not
going through a lapse. What I've
experienced is closer to awakening.
I'm not trying to shake your faith.
I've just decided not to devote my
life to God anymore.

KATE
What do you think Mom would say?

JACOB
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it. RING.

INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY

Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A standard
issue Texas motel. Richard sits outside in the car. Nobody
responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five times.

TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)
Hold your horses!

An OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter.
He's eating a BBQ rib.

OLD-TIMER
(rough)
Whatcha want?

SETH
Whatcha think I want, ya mean old
bastard? I wanna room.

EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
and drives them to their room.

RICHARD
Do they have cable?

SETH
No.

RICHARD
Do they have an X-rated channel?

SETH
No.

RICHARD
Do they have a waterbed?

SETH
They don't have anything except four
walls and a roof, and that's all we
need.

Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
trunk close to the door.

The two brothers get out of the car.

SETH
(tossing Richie the
motel keys)
Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

Richie opens the door.

Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
empty.

CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
up in the trunk.

She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
scared and looks an absolute mess.

SETH
Don't say a word.

The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
see any, slams the door.

INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY

Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

SETH
You. Plant yourself in that chair.

She sits down in the chair.

HOSTAGE
What are you planning on doing with --

SETH
-- I said plant yourself. Plants
don't talk. You wanna get on my good
side? Just sit still and don't make
a peep.

She shuts up.

Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his wound.

SETH
Let me help you.

He helps him get his jacket off.

SETH
How's it feel?

RICHARD
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of-
a-bitch.

Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
against.

SETH
I got both rooms on either side of
us, so we don't gotta worry about
eavesdropping assholes. How's that
feel? You okay?

RICHARD
Feels good.

SETH
I'm gonna go get the money.

He heads for the door.

EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY

Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.

INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY

Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping stations.
Seth looks at his watch.

SETH
It's about five o'clock.
(to hostage)
What time does it get dark around
here?

HOSTAGE
About seven.

SETH
Good. I'm going towards the border
to check things out while it's still
daylight. Call Carlos and arrange
the rendezvous.

RICHARD
Hey, when you talk to him, see if
you can arrange a better deal than
thirty percent.

SETH
That's their standard deal, brother.
They ain't about to change it for
us.

RICHARD
Did you even to try to negotiate?

SETH
These guys ain't spic firecracker
salesman from Tijuana. They don't
even know the meaning of the word
"barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray?
You give them thirty percent of your
loot. It's scripture. So it is
written, so shall it be done. You
want sanctuary, you pay the price,
and the price is thirty percent.

RICHARD
All I'm saying --

SETH
-- This conversation is over.

Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the hostage,
grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

SETH
Now, we need to have a talk. What's
your name?

HOSTAGE
Gloria.

He shakes her hand.

SETH
Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's
my brother Richie. Let's cut to the
chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
and all I want is a yes or no answer.
Do you want to live through this?

GLORIA
Yes.

SETH
Good. Then let me explain the house
rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
along like a house on fire. Rule
number one: No noise, no question.
You make a noise...
(he holds up his .45)
...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
you absolutely, positively clear
about rule number one?

GLORIA
Yes.

SETH
Rule number two: You do what we say,
when we say it. If you don't, see
rule number one.

Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
hammer.

SETH
Rule number three: Don't you ever
try and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I
got five little friends, and they
all run faster'n you can. Got it?

She nods her head yes.

He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

SETH
Open your eyes.

She does.

SETH
Gloria, you hang in there, follow
the rules, and don't fuck with us,
you'll get out of this alive. I give
you my word. Okay?

She nods her head yes.

Seth rises.

SETH
I'll be back in a bit.

He exits.

Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting across
the room in the chair.

RICHARD
Wanna come up here on the bed and
watch TV with me?

You can tell she doesn't want to.

He pats the empty space next to him.

RICHARD
Come on.

She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
next to him.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the middle
of a conversation with the party on the other end.

SETH
Things are real hot here. Crossing's
gonna be a bitch.
(pause)
Don't worry, we'll get across. But
when we do, where do we go?
(pause)
Can we make it as close to the border
as possible? Texas wants our balls.
The quicker we're in your protection,
the better I'll feel.
(pause)
Okay, where?
(pause)
The Titty Twister?
(he laughs)
I love it already. Okay, Carlos,
I'll see you and your men at the
"Titty Twister" tomorrow morning.
(pause)
Bye, my friend.

Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his Zippo
lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving the frame
empty, a subtitle appears:

INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows,
watching TV, taking on hits from a water bong in the shape
of a wizard.

ON TV

A local newscaster named KELLY HOUGE is reporting a story
about the brothers.

KELLY HOUGE
(talking to camera)
This bloody crime spree started just
a week ago today. The oldest of the
two brothers...

MUG SHOT OF SETH

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
...Seth Gecko was serving time in
Rolling's Kansas State Penitentiary
for his part in the 1988 Scott City
bank robbery in which two law
enforcement officers lost their lives.

BACK TO KELLY

KELLY HOUGE
Having served eight years of his
twenty-two year sentence, Seth Gecko
was brought to Wichita Municipal
court house for his first parole
hearing. It was while at the court
house that this man...

MUG SHOT OF RICHARD GECKO

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
...his younger brother Richard Gecko,
a known armed robber and sex offender,
pulled off a daring daylight escape...

BACK TO KELLY

KELLY HOUGE
...resulting in the death of four
Wichita law enforcement officers,
and this woman...

A red line travels from Wichita to Oklahoma.

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
From there the brothers traveled
from Kansas through Oklahoma...

The red line enters Texas and the camera moves into Texas.

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
...into the great state of Texas,
and then finally...

WE ZOOM in on a red-circled Abilene.

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
...into Abilene.

We hear GUNFIRE and SCREAMS.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE CRIMINAL COURT BUILDING - DAY

Kelly Houge walks down the courthouse steps of the criminal
courts building of Abilene. She talks to the camera. Cops,
lawyers and citizens bustle in the background.

KELLY HOUGE
The list of the dead climbed up three
more notches since our last telecast.

KELLY HOUGE
Heading the case to bring these
fugitives to justice is FBI agent
Stanley Chase. We talked with agent
Chase earlier this afternoon.

CUT TO:

VIDEO INTERVIEW

Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

STANLEY CHASE
For the time being we are very
confident we will apprehend the
fugitives in the next forty-eight
hours. The Bureau, local law
enforcement and the Texas Rangers
have all joined forces in forming a
dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
Gecko.

KELLY HOUGE
Agent Chase, does it appear that
they are heading for Mexico.

STANLEY CHASE
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
alerted the Mexican authorities.
They intend to cooperate every way
possible in bringing these fugitives
to justice.

KELLY HOUGE
Are you optimistic about the safety
of the hostage they took in Abilene,
Gloria Hill?

STANLEY CHASE
We've received no news one way or
the other. We can only hope for the
best.

KELLY HOUGE
What about the report from an
eyewitness at the liquor store who
said one of the brothers was shot?

STANLEY CHASE
This can't be confirmed at this time,
but we do believe it to be true. We
have reason to believe it was the
youngest brother Richard, and he was
shot in the vicinity of his neck and
shoulders by the store's clerk.

KELLY HOUGE
Is it safe to assume that because
the death count involved and the
loss of life of law enforcement
officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers
and the police force are taking this
manhunt personally?

STANLEY CHASE
I would say that's a very safe
assumption.

CUT TO:

Richard smiles.

RICHARD
(Newscaster's voice)
Is it safe to assume since the law
enforcement authorities in the great
state of Texas are homosexuals of a
sick and deviate nature, that they
will be too busy fucking each other
up the ass to actually catch The
Gecko Brothers?
(in an FBI voice)
I would say that's a very safe
assumption.

He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

CASPER
Would you play with me?

A big burly COP turns around.

COP
Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

RICHARD
Shit, I started to get worried. Where
the fuck ya been?

SETH
Sight seein'.

RICHARD
What'd ya see?

SETH
Cops.

RICHARD
Didya look at the border?

Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off the
TV

SETH
Yeah, I saw the border. Through
binoculars from on top of a high
building. That's about as close as I
risked getting. What's the TV say?

RICHARD
They're going to apprehend us in
forty-eight hours.

Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

SETH
(to himself)
I gotta figure a way to get across
that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
around El Paso our lives ain't worth
a shit.

RICHARD
Look, fuck the border. Let's just
dig in and wait for things to cool
down.

SETH
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
worse before it gets any fuckin'
better. We showed our ass in Texas.
We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers.
They ain't gonna stop lookin' till
they find us, and when they find us,
they're gonna kill us. Texans take
it very personal when ya kill their
law enforcement officers. The El
Paso police have already started a
motel and hotel search for us.

RICHARD
How do you know?

SETH
I heard it on the radio. We gotta
get our asses into Mexico tonight.
Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow
morning at a rendezvous on the other
side, then Carlos and his boys will
escort us to El Ray and --

Seth stops talking and looks around.

SETH
Where's the woman?

RICHARD
What?

Seth's out of his chair.

SETH
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
is she, Richard!?

RICHARD
She's in the other room.

SETH
What the fuck is she doin' there?!

He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

RICHARD
Seth, before you open the door, let
me explain what happened.

Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
Then he BURSTS open the door.

The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
room with the dead body.

SETH
(to himself)
Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

Richard rises from the bed.

RICHARD
Now, Seth, before you flip out, let
me just explain what happened.

Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

Richard backs up.

SETH
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
explanation. What's the matter with
you?

RICHARD
(low and calm)
There's nothing wrong with me,
brother. That woman tried to escape
and I did what I had to do.

SETH
No.
(pause)
That woman wouldn't of said shit if
she had a mouthful.

RICHARD
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
became a whole different person.

SETH
(slowly approaching)
Is it me? Is it my fault?

RICHARD
It's not your fault, it's her fault!

Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
holding tightly to his wrist.

SETH
Is this my fault? Do you think this
is what I am?

RICHARD
What?

SETH
This is not me! I am a professional
fucking thief. I steal money. You
try to stop me, god help you. But I
don't kill people I don't have to,
and I don't rape women. What you
doin' ain't how it's done. Do you
understand?

RICHARD
Seth, if you were me --

SETH
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
yes.

RICHARD
Yes.

SETH
Yes, Seth, I understand.

RICHARD
Yes, Seth, I understand.

Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

SETH
(whispers in Richie's
ear)
We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
and rice and beans. None of this
shit's gonna matter.

INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop Inn's
front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from the
Old-Timer.

KATE
I can't believe he's stopping here.
This place looks totally cruddy.

Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
home.

KATE
Dad, why are we stopping here?

He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

JACOB
There's nothing wrong with this place.

KATE
It's a flop house.

JACOB
It's not a flop house. It's basic
and simple. That doesn't make it a
flop house.

KATE
If it doesn't have a pool, we're
looking for a new place.

Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
courtyard.

JACOB
It has a bed. That's all I care about.

KATE
Other places have beds, they also
have cable TV, a gym, room service...

EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
thinking about how he's going to get over the border tonight.
Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the Fuller's
motor home.

Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
THUD... THUD...

KATE
Owww, my head.

Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
window.

JACOB
Watch where you're going!

THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
up at the giant motor home.

JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

SCOTT
What's this guy's problem?

JACOB
I have no idea.

Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

HONK!

JACOB
Anytime, man.

The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
side to let them pass.

Pass they do!

KATE
Creepy guy.

SETH
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from
above Seth's head. He's just solved
a problem that a mere thirty seconds
ago seemed unsolvable. He knows
exactly how he's going to cross the
border. Whistling a happy tune, he
turns and walks back into room #9.

INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
on the bed.

Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

JACOB
(yelling)
What?

From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

VOICE (O.S.)
I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate
to disturb you, but I'd like to ask
a favor.

Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

JACOB
I hope none of this is disturbing
you.

Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
he smiles.

Jacob opens the door and sees...

...Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
nicest guy in the entire world.

RICHARD
Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name
is Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
lady friend need some ice and we
don't seem to have an ice bucket.
Could we possibly borrow yours? I'll
bring it right back.

JACOB
(still partially asleep)
Sure.

We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

JACOB
What is this?

Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

SETH
It's called a punch.

Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
mouth.

RICHARD
Sit down.

Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

RICHARD
Good boy.

Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

SETH
(to Jacob)
What's your name?

JACOB
Jacob.

SETH
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
down on the bed. Make a wrong move
and I'll shoot you in the face.

Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

SETH
(to Richard)
Okay, move the Jap over there.

Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

RICHARD
Upsy daisy.

...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

SETH
(to his hostages)
What's the story with you two? You a
couple of fags?

JACOB
He's my son.

SETH
How does that happen? You don't look
Japanese.

JACOB
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

SETH
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

JACOB
What's this about, money?

SETH
It's about money, all right, but not
yours. You see, me and my brother
here are in a little hot water and
we need your assistance.

The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
Kate walks in.

The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
ready to spit.

SETH
(to Scott and Jacob)
Stop!

Jacob and Scott freeze.

Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

KATE
What's going on?

RICHARD
We're having a wet bikini contest,
and you just won.

JACOB
(to Kate)
It's okay, honey. Everything's going
to be all right.

SETH
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and
don't do nothin' stupid.
(he turns to Jacob
and Scott, who are
still standing)
You two, Simon says sit the fuck
down!

They slowly sit.

Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
for their own reasons.

SETH
(to Jacob)
Where are the keys to the motor home?

JACOB
On the dresser.

SETH
Richie, take the keys. Start that
big bastard up, and drive it up front.

Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

He looks in her face.

CLOSE-UP KATE

She smiles at him.

KATE
Richie, will you do me a favor and
eat my pussy?

CLOSE-UP RICHARD

RICHARD
Sure.

SETH (O.S.)
Richard!

Richard's eyes go to Seth.

Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

SETH
Not when you get around to it, now.

Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the room.

SETH
(pointing at Kate)
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
put on some clothes.

She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
bathroom.

Seth GRABS her wrist.

SETH
You got three minutes. One second
longer, I shoot your father in the
face. Do you understand what I just
said?

KATE
Yes.

SETH
Do you believe me?

KATE
Yes.

SETH
You damn well better. Go.

She goes into the bathroom.

JACOB
Look, if you want the motor home,
just take it and get out.

Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male hostages.

SETH
Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
easy.

We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

SETH
Get ready to move out, we're all
going on a little ride.

Jacob shakes his head "no."

JACOB
Not a chance.

SETH
Come again?

JACOB
If you're taking people, take me.
But my kids aren't going anywhere
with you.

SETH
Sorry, I need everybody.

JACOB
My children are not going with you,
and that's that.

SETH
(angry)
That's not fuckin' that...
(holds up his gun)
this is fuckin' this.
(he calms down and
looks at Scott)
Go sit over there.

Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room, leaving
the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet, conversational
tone.

SETH
I ain't got time to fuck around with
you, so I'll make this simple. Take
your kids and get in the car, or
I'll execute all three of you right
now.
(he cocks the gun and
puts it right in
Jacob's face)
What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

Jacob looks at him.

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
Good.
(to Scott)
Your old man's all right, he just
saved your life.

Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

SETH
Times up, Princess.

The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a T-shirt,
jeans and bare feet.

SETH
Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
the Lone Star night.

INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

KATE
Excuse me.

Richard zeros in on her.

RICHARD
What?

KATE
Where are you taking us?

RICHARD
Mexico.

KATE
What's in Mexico?

RICHARD
Mexicans.

He doesn't smile.

In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him calmly.

SETH
(reading his driver's
license)
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
course it is.
(motioning behind him)
What are their names?

JACOB
Scott and Kate.

Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

SETH
Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

SETH
Who's this?

JACOB
My wife.

SETH
Where is the little lady?

JACOB
In heaven.

SETH
She's dead?

JACOB
Yes, she is.

SETH
How'd she die?

JACOB
Auto wreck.

SETH
Come on, gimme some more details.
How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
kill her?

JACOB
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
on the car weren't great. She had to
stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
she crashed, she died.

SETH
Died instantly?

JACOB
Not quite. She was trapped in the
wreck for about six hours before she
passed on.

SETH
Whewww! Those acts of God really
stick it in and break it off, don't
they?

JACOB
Yes, they do.

Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
license.

SETH
Is this real?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
I've seen one of these before. A
friend of mine had himself declared
a minister of his own religion. Away
to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
doing, or are you the real McCoy?

JACOB
Real McCoy.

SETH
You're a preacher?

JACOB
I was a minister.

SETH
Was? As in not anymore?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
Why'd ya quit?

JACOB
I think I've gotten about as up close
and personal with you as I'm gonna
get. Now if you need me like I think
you need me, you're not gonna kill
me 'cause I won't answer your stupid,
prying questions. So, with all due
respect, mind your own business.

SETH
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep
this friendly. But you're right,
enough with the getting to know you
shit.  Now, there's two ways we can
play this hand. One way is me and
you go round an' round all fuckin'
night. The other way, is we reach
some sort of an understanding. Now,
if we go down that first path at the
end of the day, I'll win. But we go
down the second, we'll both win.
Now, I don't give a rat's ass about
you or your fuckin' family. Y'all
can live forever or die this second
and I don't care which. The only
things I do care about are me that
son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our
money. And right now I need to get
those three things into Mexico. Now,
stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
you don't give a shit about seeing
me and my brother receiving justice,
or the bank getting its money back.
Right now all you care about is the
safety of your daughter, your son
and possibly yourself. Am I correct?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
I thought so. You help us get across
the border without incident, stay
with us the rest of the night without
trying anything funny, and in the
morning we'll let you and your family
go. That way everybody gets what
they want. You and your kids get out
of this alive and we get into Mexico.
Everybody's happy.

JACOB
How do I know you'll keep your word?

SETH
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
this shit.

JACOB
You want me to sit here and be
passive. The only way being passive
in this situation makes sense is if
I believe you'll let us go. I'm not
there yet. You have to convince me
you're telling the truth.

SETH
Look, dickhead, the only thing you
need to be convinced about is that
you're stuck in a situation with a
coupla real mean motor scooters. I
don't wanna hafta worry about you
all fuckin' night. And I don't think
you wanna be worrying about my
brother's intentions toward your
daughter all night. You notice the
way he looked at her, didn't ya?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
Didn't like it, did ya?

JACOB
No, I didn't.

SETH
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
I'm willing to make a deal. You
behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
try to escape. I'll keep my brother
off your daughter and let you all
loose in the morning.

JACOB
You won't let him touch her?

SETH
I can handle Richie, don't worry.

The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
Seth sticks out his hand.

SETH
I give you my word.

Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
word.

SETH
(hand sticks out)
My words, my law. Better you not
take it, and that's just where we
are, then take it and not mean it.

Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

JACOB
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
don't give a fuck how many guns you
have, nothing will stop me from
killing him.

SETH
Fair enough. You break your word,
I'll kill all of you.
(calling to the back)
Kate, honey!

KATE
Yeah.

SETH
You must have a bible in here, don't
cha?

KATE
Yeah, we got a bible.

SETH
Get it and bring it up here, will
ya, please?

Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
front.

SETH
Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
(to Jacob)
Put your hand on it.

Jacob does.

SETH
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
try to escape and you'll get us across
the border.

JACOB
I swear to God I won't try to escape
and I'll do my best to get you into
Mexico.

SETH
You best better get it done, Pops.

Seth places his hand on the Bible.

SETH
I swear to God I'll let you loose in
the morning. And your daughter will
be safe. And I also swear if you do
anything to fuck me up, I'll slit
all your throats.

What you said to me in the room.

KATE
(whispers back)
What did I say?

RICHARD
(whisper)
You asked me if I would --

SETH (O.S.)
Richard!

RICHARD
(to Seth)
What?

Seth and Jacob.

SETH
I told you to watch those kids, I
didn't say talk to 'em. You guys
ain't got nothin' to say to one
another. So cut the chatter.

Richard turns to Kate.

RICHARD
(quiet)
We'll talk later.

Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing are
all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are stopping
all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the Fuller's
mobile home.

INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
up and goes into action.

SETH
Okay everybody, it's show time.
Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the
bathroom,

SETH
Scott, you come up front with your
daddy.

Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

JACOB
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

SETH
As long as you're cool, she'll be
cool. What're ya gonna say?

JACOB
I don't have the slightest idea.

SETH
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
gun next to Kate's temple.

Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
closing the door behind him.

Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
thing began.

SCOTT
What are you gonna do?

JACOB
I'm gonna try and get us across the
border.

SCOTT
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
they're back there.

Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.

INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her mouth,
the other holds a .45 against her head.

Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
should open the door.

Everybody talks low and quiet.

RICHARD
This isn't gonna work.

SETH
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

RICHARD
I just want to go on record as saying
this is a bad idea.

SETH
Duly noted. Now, shut up.

Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

RICHARD
(to himself)
They're gonna search the van.

SETH
(offhand)
As long as you don't act like a
fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

RICHARD
What does that mean?

SETH
(distracted)
What?

Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

RICHARD
You just called me a fuckin' nut.

SETH
No, I didn't.

RICHARD
Yes, you did. You said as long as I
don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
that I've been acting like a fuckin'
nut.

SETH
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
cool.

RICHARD
You meant that, but you meant the
other, too.

Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

SETH
(serious as a heart
attack)
This ain't the time, Richard.

RICHARD
(his voice rising)
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me
a fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
that stops the train on its tracks.

SETH
(real quiet and violent)
Keep your voice down.

RICHARD
(quiet back)
Or what?

BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT

JACOB
Have you forgotten about your sister?

SCOTT
They're gonna kill us. They get us
across the border, they're gonna
take us out in the desert and shoot
us.

JACOB
If they get over the border, they're
gonna let us go.

SCOTT
Dad, I watch those reality shows.
They never let anybody go. Any cop
will tell you, in a situation like
this, you get a chance, you go for
it. This is our chance.

JACOB
What about Kate?

SCOTT
They're gonna kill her anyway. At
least now with all these cops we've
got a fighting chance.

JACOB
Son, I have this situation under
control. I know exactly what I'm
doing. You're going to have to trust
me on this.

SCOTT
If trusting you means trusting those
fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
you don't tell the cops, I will.

Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
to him.

JACOB
Now, you listen to me. You ain't
gonna do a goddamn fucking thing,
you hear me! Nobody cares what you
think, I'm running this show, I make
the decisions.

SCOTT
He's running the show.

JACOB
I'm running the show. I make the
plays, and you back the plays I make.
Stop thinking with your fucking balls.
Kate in a room with a couple of
desperate men with nothing to fucking
lose ain't the time to "go for it."
I need your cover. Cover my ass.

There's a HONK behind them.

They both look out the window. It's their turn with the BORDER
PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

BORDER GUARD
How many with you?

JACOB
Just my son and I.

BORDER GUARD
What is your purpose in Mexico?

JACOB
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
first bullfight.

BACK TO BATHROOM

RICHARD
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
thing I did?

SETH
This ain't the time.

RICHARD
Oh, I know, was it possibly when
your ass was rotting in jail and I
broke it out? Yeah, you're right,
that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not
to mention stupid. But you know what?
I can fix that right now.

SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head. Richard
HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear Richard fall in
the bathroom.

BORDER GUARD
What was that?

JACOB
Oh, that's just my daughter in the
bathroom.

BORDER GUARD
You said it was just you and your
son.

JACOB
I meant me, my son and my daughter.

CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

BORDER GUARD
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

BACK TO BATHROOM

CLOSE-UP KATE

We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

KATE
I'm in the bathroom.

BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

KATE
It's open.

We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
face. She's looking up.

BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
on the toilet.

KATE
Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

BORDER GUARD
Excuse me.

He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
the floor of the shower knocked out.

Seth and Kate meet eyes.

He gives her the O.K. signal.

CUT TO:

BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
getting smaller as we drive away from it.

Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

SCOTT
It's clear.

Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

SETH
Goddamn, that was intense!

Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
farther and farther away. No cars following.

SETH
(to himself)
We did it.
(pause)
We're in Mexico.

Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
along with Scott.

Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
the van.

Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
turns to Kate.

SETH
(loud and happy)
Come here, Kate!

Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
dizzily onto the bed.

SETH
(to Kate)
You were magnificent! You told him
to shut the fucking door. I'm hiding
in the shower, and I'm thinking to
myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear
what I just fuckin' heard? And what
does he do -- he shuts the fucking
door!

Kate kind of half smiles.

SETH
If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
fuckin' marry you!

Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

SETH
I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
raised a fuckin' woman.

Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

JACOB
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
Now it's time for your part, letting
us go.

SETH
Pops, when you're right, you're right,
and you are right.

KATE
(suddenly brightens)
You're gonna let us go?

SETH
In the morning, darlin', in the
morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
through hell, and I know I've been
one rough pecker, but from here on
end you guys are in my cool book.
Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and
lay him down. Jacob, keep going on
this road till you get to a sign
that says, "Digayo." When you get to
Digayo, turn this big bastard left,
go on down for a few miles, then you
see a bar called "The Titty Twister."
From what I hear, you can't miss it.

JACOB
Then?

SETH
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
going.

He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend to
Richard.

CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
his face.

SETH (O.S.)
C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
career out of it.

Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at
the foot of the bed.

SETH
You okay?

RICHARD
(disoriented)
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

SETH
I don't know, you just passed out.

RICHARD
I did?

SETH
Yeah, we were just standing there.
You said something about your shoulder
hurting, then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

RICHARD
Really?

SETH
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
the toilet hard. It scared the shit
outta me. Sure you're okay?

RICHARD
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
fucked up.

SETH
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
clear your head right up. We are
officially Mexicans.

RICHARD
What?

SETH
We are...
(singing)
"South of the border down Mexico
way."

RICHARD
We are?

SETH
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
right now. We get there, we pound
booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
us to El Ray. And then me and you,
brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
like them apples?

Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

RICHARD
Far out.
(pause)
Where are my glasses?

SETH
They broke when you fell.

RICHARD
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

SETH
Don't worry about it, we'll get you
some glasses.

RICHARD
What dya mean, don't worry about it.
Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
I can't fuckin' see.

SETH
When we get to El Ray, I'll take
care of it.

RICHARD
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the-
wall's gonna have my fuckin'
prescription.

SETH
It's not a big deal, unless you make
it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
Richie, stop bringing me down with
bullshit.

Jacob calls to the back.

JACOB
Guys! We're here.

CUT TO:

Neon sign that flashes:

THE TITTY TWISTER

Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn Underneath the joint's
proud name on the sign, and on top of "Biker/Trucker bar,
Dusk till Dawn" is a well-endowed woman, whose breast is
being twisted by a neon hand.

EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
Mexico.

The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of nowheres
ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for miles. A
plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are parked out in
front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD, RAUNCHY MUSIC
within the structure. Signs cover the walls outside reading
things like:

"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN", "THURSDAY
COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT", "DONKEY SHOW
MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO THE DEATH,
FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM", "ATHENA AND
DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY TWISTER
DANCERS."

In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

CHET
Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
go. At the Titty Twister we're
slashing pussy in half! This is a
pussy blow out! Make us an offer on
our vast selection of pussy! We got
white pussy, black pussy, Spanish
pussy, yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold
pussy, wet pussy, tight pussy, big
pussy, bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy
pussy, smelly pussy, velvet pussy,
silk pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
it, you don't want it!

The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking lot
and stops.

INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

SETH
(to the group)
Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
Here's the deal; this place closes
at dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us
here sometime before dawn. Which by
my guesstimate is somewhere between
three or four hours from now. So
we're gonna go in there, take a seat,
have a drink -- have a bunch of
drinks, and wait for Carlos. That
could be an hour, that could be three
hours, I don't know which. But when
he gets here, me and Richie are going
to leave with him. After we split,
you guys are officially out of this
stewpot. Let me just say I'm real
happy about where we're at. We got a
real nice, "I don't fuck with you --
you don't fuck with me" attitude
going on. Now, if everybody just
keeps playin' it cool -- and I'm
talking to you, too, Richie --
everybody's gonna get what they want.
Comprende, amigos?

Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

SETH
Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the Fuller
family step out into the night.

They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister. It
literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

JACOB
Out of the stew pot and into the
fire.

SETH
Shit, I been to bars make this place
look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

RICHARD
I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this.
I been to some fucked up places in
my time, but that place is fucked
up.

Seth can't believe it.

SETH
(in a baby talk voice)
Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
baby too afraid to go into the big
scary bar?

The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
personal.

RICHARD
That's what you think?

SETH
That's how you're lookin', Richie.

RICHARD
I'm lookin' scared?

SETH
That's what you look like.

RICHARD
You know what you look like?

SETH
No, Richie, what do I look like?

RICHARD
You're lookin' green.

That's not what Seth expected to hear.

SETH
How?

RICHARD
Where are you right now?

SETH
What do you mean?

RICHARD
Where are you?

SETH
I'm here with you.

RICHARD
No, you're not. You're sippin'
margaritas in El Ray. But we're not
in El Ray. We're here -- getting
ready to go in there. You're so
pleased with yourself about getting
into Mexico, you think the job's
down. It ain't. Get back on the clock.
That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang
around there for a coupla hours, in
all likelihood, we'll get fucked
with. So get your shit together,
brother.

SETH
My shit is together.

RICHARD
It don't look together.

SETH
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
just not used to seein' me happy,
'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
years since I been happy. But my
shit is forever together.

Richard believes Seth's response.

RICHARD
Okay, just checkin'.

They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
the microphone.

CHET
(yelling into the
microphone)
Take advantage of our penny pussy
sale. Buy any piece of pussy for
regular price, you get another piece
of pussy, of equal or lesser value,
for a penny. Now try and beat pussy
for a penny! If you can find cheaper
pussy anywhere, fuck it!

Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

CHET
(in microphone, towards
Kate)
What's this? A new flavor approaching.
Apple Pie Pussy.

SETH
Step aside, asshole.

Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

CHET
Not so fast, Slick.

Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
the BONE SNAPS in two.

Chet lets out a SCREAM.

Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
NOSE.

Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that SNAPS
Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

Chet is OUT.

The whole altercation took two seconds.

Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
everyone.

SETH
Now, is my shit together, or is my
shit together?

Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

RICHARD
(slappin' Seth five)
Your shit is forever together!

They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,

INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood and
the beer at closing.

In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of bikers
and truckers.

One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in the
saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is ATHENA,
his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the crowd.

Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start
'em, but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
Seth is the first to say something.

SETH
Now this is my kinda place! I could
become a regular.

The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
as they approach.

Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who populate
the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing look across
the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies up to the
bar.

SETH
Whiskey!

RAZOR CHARLIE
(in English)
You can't come in here.

SETH
What dya mean?

RAZOR CHARLIE
This is a private club. You're not
welcome.

SETH
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
to drink here?

RAZOR CHARLIE
This bar is for bikers and truckers
only.
(points his finger to
Seth)
You, get out!

Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places
HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

BIG EMILIO
(to Seth in Spanish)
Walk, Pendajo.

Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

SETH
(low)
Take your hand off me.

BIG EMILIO
(Spanish)
I'm going to count to three.

SETH
No, I'm going to count to three.

BIG EMILIO
Uno...

SETH
Two..

Jacob jumps in the middle.

JACOB
Now wait a minute, there's no reason
to get ugly. There's just a
misunderstanding going on here. You
said this bar is for truckers and
bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

Everybody looks at Jacob.

As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

JACOB
If you look outside your door, parked
in your parking lot, you'll see a
big ass recreational vehicle. That's
mine. In order to drive that legally,
you need a class two driver's license.
That is the same license that the
DMV requires truck drivers to carry
in order to drive a truck.
(he takes the license
out of his wallet
and lays it on the
bar)
That is me, and this is my class two
license. This is a truck driver's
bar, I am a truck driver, and these
are my friends.

Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
everyone in the party and smiles.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(to Jacob)
Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
can I get you?

Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

SETH
Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
But instead he just says,

RAZOR CHARLIE
Coming right up.

Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the party
one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a buddy
punch on the shoulder.

RICHARD
Good job, Pops.

Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

SETH
That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
number one problem with Mexico, it's
not service oriented. I was feelin'
so good, and those fuckin' spics
brought me down.

Richard puts his arm around Seth.

RICHARD
Fuck 'em, shake it off.

Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
at the guy, still pissed.

SETH
You serve food, Jose?

Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
but he just smiles and says,

RAZOR CHARLIE
Best in Mexico.

SETH
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
table, send over a waitress to take
our order.

Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
Charlie's head.

The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested, wild-haired
blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

RICHARD
Anytime you want a lap dance with
that broad, say the word. It's on
me, kiddo.

He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
words about the party in Spanish.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(in Spanish)
They're not the normal road trash we
normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
No one knows they're here.

The five of them find a table and sit down.

Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

SETH
Who else?

JACOB
Pass.

SETH
(picking a fight)
Why not, against your religion?

JACOB
(won't be baited)
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
now.

SETH
Suit yourself, more for me.
(to Scott)
Scotty?

Scott shakes his head no.

SETH
(to Kate)
How 'bout you?
(pointing at Scott
and Kate)
You are safer in here with us than
wandering around a Mexican border
town all night long. Just don't do
nothin' stupid and we'll all get
along fine.
(to Scott)
Scotty, you sure you don't want a
drink?

SCOTT
Okay, I'll have one.

JACOB
No you won't.

Seth pours Scott a shot.

SETH
Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
up, boy.

Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an one-
drinker's tremor.

Seth turns to Kate.

SETH
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
round two?

KATE
Okay.

Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
knocks it back.

RICHARD
(to Seth)
Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
just created a monster.

Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

JACOB
Why are you so agitated?

SETH
I'm still stewing about that ape
laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
too.

JACOB
He backed down.

SETH
He's smilin' at us. But behind his
smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
I hear that loud and clear.

JACOB
What are you going to do?

SETH
(picking up the whiskey
bottle)
I'm gonna just sit here and drain
this bottle. And when I've drunk the
last drop, if I still feel then, the
way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
bottle and break it over his melon
head.

JACOB
Before we stepped in here, you told
all of us to be cool. That means
you, too.

SETH
(tossing it off)
I never said do what I do, I said do
what I say.

JACOB
Are you so much a fucking loser, you
can't tell when you've won?

Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can believe
what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays down his
drinking glass.

SETH
What did you call me?

JACOB
Nothing. I didn't make a statement.
I asked a question. Would you like
me to ask it again? Very well. Are
you such a loser you can't tell when
you've won?
(pause)
The entire state of Texas, along
with the FBI, is looking for you.
Did they find you? No. They couldn't.
They had every entrance to the border
covered. There's no way you could
get across. Did you? Yes, you did.
You've won, Seth, enjoy it.

Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

SETH
Jacob, I want you to have a drink
with me. I insist.

Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

SETH
To your family.

JACOB
To yours.

They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

JACOB
Now, is your shit together?

SETH
Forever together.

Seth turns to Scott.

SETH
In that camper out there I saw a
guitar. I take it that's yours.

SCOTT
Yeah, it's mine.

SETH
Go out and bring it in. I feel a
song coming on.

CUT TO:

Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered around
their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the song.
Everybody applauds.

Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
that he uses to announce dancers.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(announcer voice in
Spanish)
And now for your viewing pleasure.
The Mistress of the Macabre. The
Epitome of Evil. The most sinister
woman to dance on the face of the
earth. Lowly dogs, get on your knees,
bow your heads and worship at the
feet of SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

The crowd hushes up.

And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but the
beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage,
but like she owned the world.

And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
world is proud to be her possession.

All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard,
Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from
the table with the guitar.

When the music builds to its explosive section.

Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
room.

She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
She STANDS OVER him.

While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

SANTANICO
(to Richard in Spanish)
Drink up.

Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The CROWD
GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she surveys.

Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
the beat with his guitar.

Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
Seth and company did to Chet.

Richard continues to suck her toes.

The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
down at the seated Richard.

She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
none louder than Seth.

SETH
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
I call a fuckin' show!

One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
which she puts on.

Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

SETH
(snapping his fingers)
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
your new friend to join us?

RICHARD
Yeah.

SETH
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

RICHARD
(looking up at
Santanico)
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care
to join us?

SANTANICO
(to Richard)
Muy bien, gracias.

Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

SETH
Richie, you lucky bastard!
(to Santanico)
Now, little lady, you could of just
as easily done that to me. Whoa Nelly!
You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
arithmetic.

The table laughs.

SETH
Which reminds me of a joke. Little
Red Riding Hood is walking through
the forest and she comes across Little
Bo Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad
Wolf is walking these woods and if
he finds you he's gonna pull down
your dress and squeeze your titties?"
Then Little Red Riding Hood hitches
up her skirt and taps a .357 Magnum
she has holstered on her thigh and
says: "No he won't."

As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

JACOB
(to himself)
Oh, shit.
(to Seth)
Seth --

Seth waves him away.

SETH
Not now. So finally she comes across
the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
Wolf's laughing and says: "Little
Red Riding Hood, you know better
than to be walking around these woods
alone. You know I'm just gonna have
to pull down your dress and squeeze
your titties." Then Little Red Riding
Hood whips out her .357, cocks it,
sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face
and says: "No you won't. You're gonna
eat me, just like the story says."

Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
anything --

The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(to Chet in Spanish)
Which one?

CHET
(pointing at Seth)
This piece of shit broke my finger
and my nose...
(pointing at Richard)
then this fag kicked me in the ribs
while I was down.

That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

BIG EMILIO
(to The Gecko Brothers)
Up!

RICHARD
Fuck off, ape man!

Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
his wounded shoulder.

Santanico steps back from the table.

Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
and SLASHES Seth across the face.

Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
his laid open cheek.

Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
before he hits the floor.

Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
out of gunfire.

The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
they were doing.

The music continues to play, though the dancers stop dancing.

Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
something.

Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
and puts it to his face.

RICHARD
How are you?

SETH
Scarred for life, that's how I am!

Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

SETH
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards the
crowd.

SETH
Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
as dead as these fucks!

SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
to the floor, splattering.

WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills her
nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
transformation.

Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

KATE
(yelling)
Richie, look out!

Before Richie can turn around.

SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and SINKS
her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

Seth turns to his brother's cry.

He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to a
cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
about, trying to knock her off.

Richard screams to Seth:

RICHARD
Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
can't get a clear shot.

Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
rides him down to the floor.

Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
half way before he stops, saying:

RICHARD
(with his dying breath)
Fucking Bitch!

He tumbles over, a corpse.

SETH
Richie.

Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
their faces.

The patrons scream.

A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
and yells:

WHORE
Dinner is served!

The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
VAMPIRES.

The vamps attack.

What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
necks.

Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
anything.

Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
They hide and watch.

Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
motionless, watching what he can't believe.

Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
eyes POP OPEN.

She RISES in her snake/dance way.

Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

SANTANICO
Let's see if you taste as good as
your brother.

She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the side
of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a pool
cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade
and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the
other.

The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
goes head to head with a stripper.

The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the vamp
bitch blow for blow.

Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
on the wooden leg.

FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
appears, straight razor in hand.

Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor Charlie
SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool cue at
him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie UPSIDE
the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.  Charlie
FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of the cue
in Razor Charlie's heart.

Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
vampire's death scream.

Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He tries
to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his chest,
pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but the
pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed
on his chest.

SANTANICO
I'm not gonna drain you completely.
You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
eat bugs because I order it. Because
I don't think you're worthy of human
blood, you'll feed on the blood of
stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
And at my command, you'll lick the
dog shit from my boot heel. Since
you'll be my dog, your new name will
be "Spot". Welcome to slavery.

SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
end over end.

CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is momentarily
dazed. She looks down at Seth.

Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

BIG EMILIO
Noooooo!

He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
Jacob.

SETH
We may be in trouble.

Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla walks
through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting vamps
and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out Seth
and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack him, with a
QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed aside,
receiving a broken neck for the effort.

Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
Seth and Jacob.

Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
look like a huge walking shark.

Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, you, monkey man!

Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

SEX MACHINE
Anything you gotta say to them, say
to me first.

Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
effortlessly knocks them away.

They both hit the ground.

Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
ahead."

Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
locomotive.

Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
who HITS the floor.

Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the savage
beating.

SEX MACHINE
That's enough.

Jacob and Seth stop.

Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead vamp.

Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He breaks
into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from around his
mouth.

Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

CHET
You know what everybody says about
me? I suck!

Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of his
head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips off her
cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening his mouth.
She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll up back into
his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

GULP.

Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his mouth
and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He jumps up
from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain. He jumps
from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming all the
while.

Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
their faces.

Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

CHET
I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

CHET
Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop
the pain, stop the pain, stop the
pain...

He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being staked,
Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
customers have been butchered or drained.

All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding wooden
stakes.

The four human men group together. The four female vampires
charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four staked
bodies hit the floor.

Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
side.

They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has taken
place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

FROST
Ain't they supposed to burn up or
something?

At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating everyone's
face. The sound of quick burning flames fills the air.
Everybody shields their eyes from the intense light, which
lasts only a split second.

It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All that
remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once
lay.

They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over to
his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

He takes his dead hand.

SETH
Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things
up. You'd really like it in El Ray.
We'd find peace there. I love you
little brother, I'll miss ya bad.

Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD'S EYES
POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

RICHARD
I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
love you, too.

Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

SETH
Touch my brother with that stake,
biker, and vampires won't need to
suck your blood, they'll be able to
lick it up off the floor.

SEX MACHINE
He ain't your brother no more.

SETH
That's a matter of opinion, and I
don't give a fuck about your's.

Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
the ground.

JACOB
Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us
all!

Seth aims his gun at the group.

SETH
Shut up!

Richard's giggling.

RICHARD
Yeah, shut up.

Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

SETH
Hold him down.

The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

SETH
Richie, here's the peace in death I
could never give you in life.

Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate, of
all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at the
bar.

KATE
Are you okay?

SETH
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
world's my oyster, except for the
fact that I just rammed a wooden
stake in my brother's heart because
he turned into a vampire, even though
I don't believe in vampires. Aside
from that unfortunate business,
everything's hunky-dory.

KATE
I'm really sorry.

SETH
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had
half a chance you'd feed us to them!

JACOB
Then why didn't I?

Jacob walks over to Seth.

JACOB
I saved your life. I didn't have to,
but I did. And I'm sorry you lost
your brother. I'm sorry he's dead.
I'm sorry everybody's dead. Now, if
we're gonna get out of this we need
each other. And we need you sober
and thinking, not drunk and...

As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has grown
LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to identify
it.

JACOB
What the hell is that?

FROST
At first I just thought it was birds.

SEX MACHINE
No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
gnaw.

Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

SETH
It's bats.

EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
bats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
inside.

INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to do
next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little claws
poke their way through.

JACOB
Give me a hand!

Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
items to help secure and barricade the door.

As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and the
windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops open
his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious activity.
Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new friend. The
dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's putting a
board into place. He springs to his feet and POUNCES on her,
just as Sex Machine turns from across the room in her
direction.

SEX MACHINE
Watch out, girly!

The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a scream.
The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but she's
moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The others
hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine, Big
Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue. As
the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out of
Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the vamp
in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her and
spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and SWINGS
the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking the bat in
two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the vamp lies on
the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one of the broken
ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's heart. He dies
and bursts into flames.

At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

SEX MACHINE
(mumbling to himself)
Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire Hunter.
He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their feet.
Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into flames.
The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap, SMACKS Sex
Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for a loop.

As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS on
his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a stack
of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate by
the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is lying
in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine raises
his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the vamp's black
heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames, which hits the
whiskey, starting a giant fire.

SEX MACHINE
Fire!

Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

FROST
(to Sex Machine)
We'll put this out. You stake the
rest of these fuckers.

SEX MACHINE
Way ahead of ya.
(to Kate)
What's your name, girly?

KATE
Kate, what's yours?

SEX MACHINE
Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
fuckers.

Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
work STAKING the dead bodies.

Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
whatever else is at hand.

A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands in
front of the window.

SCOTT
(yelling)
We got a problem!

Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
body through the newly formed hole.

Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
his head back through the hole.

Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
when...

WHAM!

The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
LANDING HARD on his back.

Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split RUNS
UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the bat's
neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has its
CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just inches
from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

SETH
Get this bastard off of me!

Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and GRABS
the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
while, then...

BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the bat-
thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a cup
next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's heart.
The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of FLAMES,
followed by a pile of goo.

Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
the bat-thing.

Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
to try and claw their way in.

JACOB
Is everybody okay?

Everyone mutters "yeah."

JACOB
Okay, does anybody here know what's
going on?

SETH
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
trying to get inside and suck our
fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
simple. And I don't wanna hear any
bullshit about "I don't believe in
vampires" because I don't fuckin'
believe in vampires either. But I do
believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
vampires! Now, does everybody agree
we're dealin' with vampires.

Everybody agrees.

SETH
You too, preacher?

JACOB
I'm like you. I don't believe in
vampires, but I believe in what I
saw.

SETH
Good for you. Now, since we all
believe we're dealing with vampires,
what do we know about vampires?
Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
cross?

JACOB
In the Winnebago.

SETH
In other words, no.

SCOTT
What are you talking about? We got
crosses all over the place. All you
gotta do is put two sticks together
and you got a cross.

SEX MACHINE
He's right. Peter Cushing does that
all the time.

SETH
I don't know about that. In order
for it to have any power, I think
it's gotta be an official crucifix.

JACOB
What's an official cross? Some piece
of tin made in Taiwan? What makes
that official? If a cross works
against vampires, it's not the cross
itself, it's what the cross
represents. The cross is a symbol of
holiness.

SETH
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
covered, moving right along, what
else?

FROST
Wooden stakes in the heart been
workin' pretty good so far.

SEX MACHINE
Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
forget, does silver do anything to a
vampire?

SCOTT
That's werewolves.

SEX MACHINE
I know silver bullets are werewolves.
But I'm pretty sure silver has some
sort of effect on vampires.

KATE
Does anybody have any silver?

ALL
No.

KATE
Then who cares?

SCOTT
When's sunrise?

Jacob looks at his watch.

JACOB
About two hours from now.

KATE
So all we have to do is get by for a
few more hours and then we can walk
right out the front door.

SEX MACHINE
Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
barricades, that door, those plastered
windows and these walls will last
two more hours with those bat fucks
fuckin' with 'em.

JACOB
Has anybody here read a real book
about vampires, or are we just
remembering what a movie said? I
mean a real book.

SEX MACHINE
You mean like a Time-Life book?

Everybody laughs.

FROST
(in a cowboy voice)
John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
shot a man for snorin'.

JACOB
I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
what do we know about these vampires?

SETH
Aside from they're thirsty.

FROST
Well, one thing, they might got super
human strength, but you can hurt
'em.

JACOB
Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
Santanico didn't kill her, but it
didn't feel too good either.

SEX MACHINE
Another thing, you try and ram a
broken chair leg in a human, you
better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
The human body is one rough-tough
machine. But these vamps got soft
bodies. The texture of their skin is
softer, mushier. You can push shit
right through 'em. Conceivably, if
you hit one hard enough, you could
take their fuckin' head off.

SCOTT
You could take their head off.

SETH
Actually, our best weapon against
these satanic cocksuckers is this
man.
(he points at Jacob)
He's a preacher.

Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

SETH
As far as God's concerned, we might
just as well be a piece of fuckin'
shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
one problem, his faith ain't what it
used to be.

Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
Jacob stands over him.

JACOB
I've had enough of your taunts.

Seth looks up from the floor.

SETH
I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
to us. But a man who's a servant of
God can grab a cross, shove it in
these monsters' asses. A servant of
God can bless the tap water and turn
it into a weapon.

Seth rises.

SETH
I know why you lost your faith. How
could true holiness exist if your
wife can be taken away from you and
your children? Now, I always said
God can kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I
changed my lifetime tune about thirty
minutes ago' cause I know, without a
doubt, what's out there trying to
get in here is pure evil straight
from hell. And if there is a hell,
and those monsters are from it,
there's got to be a heaven. Now which
are you, a faithless preacher or a
mean, mother fuckin' servant of God?

Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

JACOB
I'm a mean, mother fucking servant
of God.

The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only sound
to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing. It
immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit they're
in.

KATE
I don't know if I can take two hours
of that noise.

FROST
You can. You'll take it 'cause ya
got no choice. How'd ya like twenty
four hours of it, lying in a muddy
ditch with only the rotting corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

JACOB
What are you talking about?

FROST
Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
behind enemy lines, lying in a rat
hole with my entire squad dead. They
thought they killed everybody, and
except for me, they were right. But
it wasn't for lack of trying. A
grenade blew up right next to me,
that's why I'm so pretty. They thought
I was dead, so I played dead. They
dumped all the bodies in a ditch.
All I could do was lie there playing
possum. Dead bodies under me, dead
bodies on top of me, listening to
the enemy laugh and joke hour after
hour after hour...

As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
say:

MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Thirst.

"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Thirst.

We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
Stop fucking saying that!

TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
Thirst!

SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
That bite weren't nothin'. It just
hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
all. It barely punched the skin.

Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
many voices, male, female, children saying:

VOICES (V.O.)
Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck actually
pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine has turned
into a vampire.

The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

FROST
...and then when I came back to my
senses, I realized I had killed the
entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
My bayonet had blood and chunks of
yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
shish kabob. And to this day I don't
have the slightest idea how I --

Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

SEX MACHINE
THIRST!

Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
into his neck.

The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
pulling.

Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and SINKS
them in Jacob's arm.

Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
bleeding neck.

FROST
I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
sack of potatoes.

He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a table.

Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

FROST
(to Sex Machine)
You're dead, motherfucker! You're
gonna bite me! You just turned me
into a vampire, asshole!

SEX MACHINE
What are you gonna do about it?

Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
straight at Sex Machine.

Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face COLLIDES
with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so hard it
lifts the biker off the ground and propels him through the
air.

Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

SETH
Oh shit!

Jacob sees.

JACOB
Good lord!

Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
and CRASHES through it.

Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
hand and runs for the backroom.

Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
ground.

Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
howls and snaps in fury.

Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
.45 in its big mouth.

SETH
You wanna suck something, suck on
this!

He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
the wall.

Kate yells:

KATE
We have to go back for Daddy!

SETH
Daddy's dead.

KATE
Noooo!

She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up against
the wall.

SCOTT
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He
was too far away. If flinging that
door and filling this room with those
bat-things would save him, I'd fling
it. The only thing it'll do is turn
us into one of them.

SETH
He needs our help!

SCOTT
He's beyond our help. You saw him
get bit. I saw him get bit. We all
saw it. You can't help him. I've got
no one left to lose but you. I can't
be alone again. We're sticking
together.

Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.

INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
God. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampires
take one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of God tone.
As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost lying
on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a candy bar.
But Jacob is too much in control to let even this repugnant
sight trip him up.

Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

JACOB
Open the door.

The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS shut.

Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
bloody arm.

When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

SETH
Did he...?

JACOB
Yep.

Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
over tables and cussing a blue streak.

SETH
Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
creatures on the other side.

SETH
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
you godless pieces of shit!

JACOB
(to Seth)
You bet your sweet ass you are, and
I'm gonna help you do it. But we
ain't got much time.

Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

KATE
You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
daddy?

JACOB
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
I'm already dead.

Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

JACOB
(to his children)
Children, listen to me. I love you
two more than anybody. And I just
want you to know you've made me proud
all your lives. But never more so
than tonight. And I wish we could
sit here and cry till I pass on, but
we can't. Because I'm not going to
pass on. I'm going to turn into a
monster. And when I do, I'm going to
be dangerous. But before that happens,
just know I love you.
(to Seth and the kids)
Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
thirty minutes our friends outside
will bust in this door. And I'll
probably turn into a vampire within
the hour. Now, you have two choices.
You can wait for me to turn, then
deal with me, then wait for them to
burst inside here and the three of
you will deal with them. Or, we can
kick open that door and the four of
us can hit 'em with everything we
have, and carve a path right through
'em to front entrance. But if we're
gonna go at 'em, we gotta go at 'em
now. I confused them, I scared them,
I took them off guard. But they're
going to get unconfused, they're
going to get unscared, they're going
to get together and they're going to
hit that door like a ton of bricks.
And when that moment arrives, we
gotta be ready.

Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
with boxes and crates.

JACOB
What's this stuff?

SETH
My guess is that this little dive's
been feeding on nomad road waifs
like bikers and truckers for a
longtime. This is probably some of
the shipments they stole off the
trucks.

JACOB
Well, I say lets tear this place
apart for weapons. So when they burst
through that door, we'll make 'em
wish they never did.

SETH
I don't give a shit about living or
dying anymore. I just want to send
as many of these devils back to hell
as I can.

JACOB
Amen.

MONTAGE

The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee, teddy
bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the doctor
ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment
of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores are a shipment
of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons. And captured
en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools,
saws and jack hammers.

Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
backroom sink.

Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

Vampires all start converging on the back room door, getting
their courage back.

Kate makes water balloons.

Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
turning it into holy water.

Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes, begins
to be pounded on by the undead on the other side. The room
tone is a combination of chewing, scratching, pounding,
squeaking and screaming.

Finally they're ready.

Jacob turns to his kids.

JACOB
Before we go any further, I need you
three to promise me something. I'll
fight with you to the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them, I
won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
lap dog of Satan. I want you three
to promise you'll take me down, no
different from the rest.

The kids can't say the words.

SETH
I promise.

JACOB
Kate, Scott?

KATE
I promise.

JACOB
Scott?

SCOTT
Yeah, I promise.

Jacob doesn't believe them.

JACOB
Why don't I believe you?
(he picks up the .45)
I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
want you to swear to God that you'll
kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
just kill myself right now. Now,
since you need me I think you better
swear. Kate, do you swear to God
that when I turn into one of the
undead, you'll kill me?

Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
temple.

JACOB
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
only gonna count to five. One...two...
three... four...

KATE
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

JACOB
Not good enough, swear to God.

KATE
I swear to God, our father, that
when you change into one of the
undead, I will kill you.

JACOB
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
less time, so I'm only giving you
the count of three. One...

SCOTT
You don't believe in suicide.

JACOB
It's not suicide if you're already
dead. Two...

SCOTT
Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
I swear to God in Jesus Christ's
name.

JACOB
Thank you, son.

SETH
Okay, vampire killers, let's kill
some fuckin' vampires.

INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
the door.

Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes
and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding the
jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room into the
bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
starting up the jackhammer.

SETH
Kill 'em all!

Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire flesh.

The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk forward.

They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
the door.

Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green
vamp blood.

Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the other.

Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
toss them into the crowd.

They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
in pain.

From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
HURLS toward the group.

Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
the hammer stake into vampire chests.

The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
junk.

SCOTT
(yelling)
Why did they block the door again?

JACOB
(yelling)
To keep the daylight out! This is
where they sleep! Get to the door!

Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
off the ground.

Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
he CRASHES into a table.

The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking
out of his chest, dead.

Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
screams:

KATE
Seth!

Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up his dukes.

SETH
Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a
bite and feel all right!

Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

KATE
(yelling)
I'm going for 'em!

JACOB
No!

KATE
Everybody goes home!

Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
Seth's direction.

KATE
(screaming)
Die, monster, die! Die, monster,
die!

Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
couple of water balloons and a stake.

KATE
(to Seth)
Watch my back!

SETH
Anytime.

Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
bar.

Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
fiery death.

Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He can't
hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts to
hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him with
happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
His eyes are yellow.

Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and SMASHES
it against Jacob's head.

The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
up to fire.

A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
with the boy he once called his son.

Scott's eyes turn to steel.

SCOTT
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
name.

He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
head bursts into flames, then explodes.

From across the room, Kate sees her daddy ignite. She cries
out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

SETH
Fight now, cry later.

Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
it bites into him. He drops the .45.

Kate sees Scott get bit.

KATE
Oh my god.

Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
Scott screams.

KATE
You bastards!

She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
Scott is in agony.

SCOTT
Kill me, Kate!

Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming up
by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three times.

One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

The remaining vamps approach.

All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
balloon.

SETH
How many bullets left, kid?

KATE
Not many.

SETH
Well, when you run out of weapons,
just start cold cocking 'em. Make
'em sing for their supper.

The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things
do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the
holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two bat-things burst
into flames and spiral to the floor.

The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
holding the .45, arm outstretched.

KATE
(to Seth)
Should I use the last bullets on us?

SETH
You use 'em on the first couple of
these parasites that try to bite
you.

The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
on the face of an approaching vampire.

Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

SETH
Shoot more holes!

Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth
with a safe, lighted area.

The .45's empty.

The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
able to get at them.

The two survivors hold hands, when...

All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
from the outside.

The vamps look towards it in horror.

From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
Spanish accent.

VOICE (O.S.)
(in Spanish)
I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth
in there?

SETH
(yelling)
Carlos!
(in Spanish)
Help us, bash the door. Bash the
door in!

CARLOS (O.S.)
(in Spanish)
Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
Hurry, hurry!

The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
each other.

The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fire coming from
the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
door.

The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

The Mexican gangster CARLOS and his two henchmen, DANNY and
MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
in fright.

Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds
of beams of sunlight scattering through the room. Vamps try
and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps combust
in fiery explosions.

The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
door into the parking lot.

EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
Carlos's Mercedes.

CARLOS
(to Seth)
What the fuck was going on in there?

Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

CARLOS
(in Spanish)
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

SETH
Why the fuck, outta all the god
forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did
you have us rendezvous at that place?

CARLOS
I don't know, one place's as good as
another.

SETH
Have you ever been there before?

CARLOS
No, but I passed by it a couple of
times. It's out in the middle of
nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.
You said meet you in the morning.

SETH
Well, because you picked that place
out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
And this girl's family's dead.

Carlos stands up again.

CARLOS
I'm sorry to hear that. What were
they, psychos?

SETH
Did they look like psychos? They
were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
don't care how crazy they are.

Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
themselves again.

CARLOS
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
to you?

SETH
You can't, but fifteen percent instead
of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
good start.

CARLOS
Twenty-eight.

SETH
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
dead and he's not coming back, and
it's all your fault. Twenty.

They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

SETH AND CARLOS
(in Spanish)
Twenty-five.

Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
to a red 1990 Porsche 911.

CARLOS
You like the car?

SETH
I said new, this is an '90.

CARLOS
It's hardly been used at all. I got
it from a drug dealer who only drove
it 5 times in as many years. Swear
to God. That's like new.

SETH
So do I just follow you?

CARLOS
Yeah, follow us.

SETH
So let's do it.

CARLOS
(to Danny and Manny)
Vamanos!

Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

Kate stands alone.

The whole desert seems between them.

So much to say... but no words.

SETH
I'm sorry.

KATE
Me too.

Long pause.

SETH
See ya.

KATE
Later.

Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
says behind him:

KATE (O.S.)
Seth.

Seth turns around.

KATE
You want some company?

Seth smiles.

SETH
Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

He blows her a kiss across the desert.

She blows one back.

Seth's in his car and GONE.

Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and begins
her long walk home.

THEME OF MOVIE BEGINS POUNDING

THE END

OPENING CREDITS

INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT – DAY

We hear the rhythm of funky seventies SOUL MUSIC.

Then SHE steps into FRAME.

She is JACKIE BROWN, a stewardess dressed in her CABO AIR
uniform. (A little shuttle airline that flies from Los Angeles
to Cabo San Lucas. Approximate flight time: forty five
minutes)

Jackie stands still as a people-mover slowly inches her
through the airport. The CREDITS APPEAR and DISAPPEAR in
front of her.

Jackie Brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid
forties, though she looks like she's in her mid-thirties.

The people-mover reaches the end of the line, she steps off.

She breezes through Customs and we follow her with a STEDICAM
as she strides through the airport... She gets to her gate,
disappears inside the plane for a moment, comes back out
sans flight bag, picks up the microphone.

JACKIE
(into mike)
Flight 710 Cabo San Lucas, now
boarding Gate 12, first class only.

With a smile on her face, she collects passengers' boarding
passes as they board the plane.

EXT. FIRING RANGE – DAY

VIDEO

A chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all holding
different automatic weapons, BLASTING away.

The cheap VIDEO TITLES to:

"CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS"

Play over this image.

One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous brunette
named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera holding a TEC-9
and describing it.

SIDNEY
(to camera)
Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
its makers as being tough as the
toughest customer.

SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of birth,
appear at the bottom lefthand corner. As Sidney continues
her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S VOICE begins
talking over the video.

BLACK MAN (O.S.)
That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
spray gun outta South Miami.

After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.

BLACK VOICE
Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
for two hundred and sell 'em for
eight.

INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT – NIGHT

The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL ROBBIE.

Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather jackets
(Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball caps to cover
his balding head are Ordell's "look." At this moment Ordell's
wearing an open silk shirt.

Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen. (the
most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a cocktail
in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice) and the remote
control in the other, pacing the floor in his I-can-talk-
anybody-into-anything voice.

LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and dungarees),
sits on the sofa staring blankly at the video, drinking Jack
Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also in his mid forties, has
lived over half of his life in penal institutions. The
experience has affected both his body language and his thought
process.

While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a correction
facility, in the real world his timing is thrown. It's like
a song he doesn't know the lyrics to but attempt to sing
anyway.

The third person watching the video is the person who lives
in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-three,
is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like the kind
you see in the old Crown International movies from the
seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach" and "Beach
Girls," except Melanie is older than any of those girls ever
are. She's dressed in her Melanie-uniform of stringy Levis
cutoffs and a stringy bra top. So far Melanie has been able
to make a living out of lying in the sun, always finding a
generous, wealthy man more than willing to pay her rent and
pick up her tabs. In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese
industrialists, film production guys, and Middle Eastern
businessmen who kept Melanie. And it was places like the
Bahamas, Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept
her.

But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in Hermosa
Beach, California that Ordell pays for and drops in and out
of. She's curled up in a reclining chair, smoking weed from
a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and paying no attention
to the video.

ORDELL
This TEC-9? They advertise it as
being the most popular gun in American
crime. Can you believe that shit? It
actually says that on the little
booklet that comes with it. "Most
Popular Gun in American Crime," like
they're proud of that shit.

Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.

Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
bikini, holding a Styer Aug.

ORDELL
Check out this body-builder chick...
Now see what she got. That's a Styer
Aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
Listen.

Ordell punches up the volume.

Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.

Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.

ORDELL
Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
Austria. My customers don't know
shit about it, so there ain't no
demand.
(to Melanie)
Baby, I could use some more ice.

Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
from him and moves to the kitchen.

ORDELL
But put that bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want
one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
they don't want one, they want two,
cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
What they don't know, and that movie
don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem. I always
try and steer a customer towards a 9-
millimeter. Damn near the same weapon,
don't have half the jammin' problems.
But some niggas out there, you can't
tell them anything. They want a .45.
The killer had a .45, they want a
.45.

Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then sits
where she was.

ORDELL
Thanks, Baby.

LOUIS
Who's your partner?

Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading "Movieline
Inside" magazine.

ORDELL
Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat
in Mexico. I deliver the merchandise
to him, gets it to my customers. On
all my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga
didn't have a pot to piss in or a
window to throw it out 'fore I set
'em up. Now, motherfucker's rollin'
in cash. He got himself a yacht,
with all kinds of high tech
navigational shit on it.
(back to video)
AK-47, the very best there is.

GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces
camera and describes the AK-47.

ORDELL
When you absolutely, positively,
gotta kill every motherfucker in the
room, accept no substitute. That
there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-
fifty and double my money.

The phone rings.

ORDELL
Get that for me, will ya baby?

MELANIE
You know it's for you.

Ordell just stares at her.

ORDELL
Girl, you better not make me go over
there and put my feet to ya.

Louis keeps staring at he screen.

Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates the
living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone, says:

MELANIE
Hello.

Puts the phone down and says;

MELANIE
It's for you.

Before Ordell knows it, Melanie is back in the reclining
chair, reclining back all the way.

Ordell, pissed, looks at her a moment before taking the phone.

ORDELL
(into phone)
Yeah.
(pause)
Hey, Junebug, what's up?

Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels, watching
the video.

Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;

MELANIE
(referring to the
tape)
It's boring, isn't it?

LOUIS
I can sit through it once.

MELANIE
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

LOUIS
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.

MELANIE
He's just repeating shit he overheard.
He ain't any more a gun expert than
I am.

Holding up her pipe.

MELANIE
Want a hit?

LOUIS
Sure.

Louis takes a hit off the pipe.

MELANIE
When did you get out of jail?

LOUIS
Four days ago.

MELANIE
Where at?

LOUIS
Susanville.

MELANIE
How long?

LOUIS
Two months shy of four years.

MELANIE
Four years?

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

MELANIE
What for?

LOUIS
Bank robbery.

MELANIE
Really, I'm impressed.

Louis takes a drink of whiskey.

MELANIE
Four years that's a long fuckin time.

Louis nods his head in agreement.

Ordell hangs up the phone.

Ordell comes back, sitting down on the other side of Louis.

ORDELL
See, what did I tell you? Man in New
York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and
Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want
it? It's the gun that nigga on "New
York Undercover" uses. Because of
that nigga, I can sell it to this
nigga for twelve-fifty.

LOUIS
What's your cost?

ORDELL
As low as two.

LOUIS
Are you serious?

ORDELL
That's what I been tellin' you. Start
adding these motherfuckin' figures
up, and you tell me this ain't a
business to be in.

The phone rings again. Ordell looks at Melanie. Melanie looks
at Ordell.

They have a bit of a staring contest before she gets up and
gets the phone.

ORDELL
I got me five M-60 machine guns.
These came straight from the Gulf
War. I sold me three of them so far,
twenty grand a piece.

LOUIS
That's good money.

ORDELL
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna
make me a million dollars out of
this. I already got me a half-a-
million sittin' in Mexico. When I do
this last delivery, I'm gonna make
me another half-million.

LOUIS
Then what?

ORDELL
I get out. Spend the rest of my life
spending.

Melanie sits back down in he chair.

ORDELL
Who is it?

MELANIE
It's Beaumont.

KITCHEN

Ordell, drink in hand, picks up the receiver.

ORDELL
(into phone)
Beaumont -- Ordell. What's the
problem?
(pause)
What the fuck you doin' in jail?
(pause)
What the fuck you doin' that for?
(pause)
Ain't you got better sense than to
be drivin' drunk carrying a goddam
pistol?

He listens to Beaumont on the other line -- it's obvious
Beaumont's starting to freak out. Ordell changes his tone.

ORDELL
Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me.
Number one, you need to chill out,
nigga. Bad as this shit is, this
shit ain't as bad as you think it
is.
(pause)
Course you're scared. That's what
these motherfuckers get paid for
scarin' the shit outta ya. That's
their job. And my job is to get you
the fuck home so let me tell you
what is gonna happen... May I
speak?... Thank you... You gonna
spend the night in jail; it's too
late to get you out now. Tomorrow,
they gonna take you into court. I'm
gonna be there. Judge gonna set your
bail. I'm gonna pay your bail, they
gonna cut you loose. By tomorrow
night, you'll be back home, I promise.
(pause)
So just calm your ass down, and I'll
see you tomorrow.
(pause)
You owe me a helluva lot more than
one, nigga.
(laughs)
See you.

Ordell hangs up the phone.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – DAY

The store front window of Cherry Bail Bonds in Inglewood,
California. The name of the business is spelled out on the
window, which also includes a drawing of a fat red cherry.

Ordell's BLACK MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE pulls up.

Ordell in the driver's seat. Louis in shotgun position.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – DAY

Inside Cherry Bail Bonds, looking out through the picture
window. We can read the name on the glass backwards. Ordell
and Louis appears in the window and enter the building. Ordell
carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.

An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone, can
be heard.

Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang back."

MALE VOICE (O.S.)
...the judge doesn't give a fuck
about that. He's ready to habitualize
you. Is that what you want -- you
wanna look at ten years?

The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a regular-
Joe-type white guy in his fifties, sits behind his desk
talking on the phone. His eyes raise as he sees Ordell
approach him.

MAX
(on phone)
Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll
get you out, I promise. But it means
I gotta pick you up tonight.

Ordell motions to the chair in front of Max's desk. Max
motions for Ordell to take a seat.

MAX
(on phone)
Reggie, there ain't no two ways about
it. You're spending the night in
jail, but I already told you I'll
get you out tomorrow. Now where are
you?
(pause)
You're at your mother's house, aren't
you?

Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).

He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm around
a big, powerfully built black man.

They're both grinning.

Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a rock.
Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.

MAX
(on phone)
Okay. Just stay put till I come for
you.
(pause)
Reggie, do yourself a really big
favor and be there when I get there.

He hangs up the phone.

Ordell sits in front of the desk, smiling at him and smoking.

MAX
How can I help you?

ORDELL
(indicating the Viceroy)
Where would you like me to put my
ash?

Max looks at him for a moment.

MAX
Use that coffee cup on the desk.

Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little bit
of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.

ORDELL
And I need me a bond for ten thousand.

Max throws a look past Ordell to Louis.

ORDELL
Oh, that's just my white friend,
Louis. He's got nothing to do with
my business. We just hangin together.
We're on our way to a cocktail lounge.

From across the room, Louis nods his head in Max's direction.

Max looks at him a moment, then back to Ordell.

ORDELL
(returning to the
photo)
Who's that big Mandingo nigga you
gotcha arm around?

Max looks at him a moment and says;

MAX
That's Winston. He works here.

ORDELL
He's a big one. You two tight?

MAX
Yeah.

ORDELL
It was our idea to take the picture,
wasn't it?

Max looks at Ordell, getting his drift, then says;

MAX
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar
bond. What've you got for collateral?

ORDELL
Gonna have to put up cash.

MAX
You have it with you?

Ordell picks up his Lakers bag and puts it in the empty chair
next to him.

ORDELL
It's in my bag.

MAX
You have cash. What do you need me
for?

ORDELL
C'mon, you know how they do. Black
man comes in with ten thousand, they
wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they
gonna wanna know where I got it.
Second, they gonna keep a big chunk
of it -- start talkin' that court
cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack.
I'll go through you.

MAX
Cost you a thousand for the bond.

ORDELL
I know that.

Louis just stands, feeling uncomfortable, in the other room
drinking coffee.

MAX
Who's it for? A relative?

ORDELL
Fella named Beaumont. They have him
up at county. It started out drunk
driving, but they wrote it up
"possession of a concealed weapon."
Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.

MAX
Ten thousand sounds high.

ORDELL
They ran his name and got a hit.
He's been in before.

Besides, Beaumont's from Kentucky, and I think they're
prejudiced against black men from the South out here.

MAX
He takes off and I gotta go to
Kentucky to bring him back, you pay
the expenses.

ORDELL
You think you could do that?

Max taking papers out of the drawer...

MAX
I've done it.

...picking up the pen...

MAX
What's his full name?

ORDELL
Beaumont. That's the only name I
know.

Max looks at Ordell, but doesn't ask him the obvious question.

Max picks up the phone.

MAX
(on phone)
Records office.

Max on hold, looks at Ordell.

Ordell smiles.

MAX
(back on the line)
Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry
Bail Bonds. Who's this?
(pause)
Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you
to look up the booking card and rough
arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.
(pause)
That's all I have. I believe it's a
surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.

Louis enters the area, standing over Ordell.

LOUIS
I'm going to wait in the car.

ORDELL
Sure.
(to Max)
We almost done, ain't we?

MAX
Getting there.

ORDELL
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.

Ordell pulls out a heavy-duty keychain with a shitload of
keys on it.

ORDELL
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.

LOUIS
Which one is for the car?

Ordell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki comes
back on the line.

Max speaks with her as he fills out his papers.

ORDELL
(holding a key)
This one's for the ignition...
(holding a little
black box)
...but you gotta hit this thing to
shut the alarm off and unlock the
door.

LOUIS
What do I do?

ORDELL
You ain't got to do nothing. Just
point at it and push the button.
You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
means the alarm's off and the doors
are open.

LOUIS
Okay.

ORDELL
Now play the volume as loud as you
want but don't touch my levels. I
got them set just the way I want
'em.

Louis nods and goes out.

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – DAY

Louis walks out of the office. He goes up to Ordell's black
Mercedes. He points the little black box at it. The car goes
BLEEP.

He gingerly approaches it, opens the door and climbs inside.

INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE – DAY

Max hangs up the phone.

MAX
(to Ordell)
Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL
Livingston, huh?

MAX
On his prior, he served nine months,
and he's working on four years'
probation.

ORDELL
You don't say.

MAX
Do you know what he's on probation
for?

ORDELL
Haven't a clue.

MAX
Possession of unregistered machine
guns.

ORDELL
Will they consider this a violation
of his probation?

MAX
They do consider this a violation of
his probation. Your boy's looking at
ten years, plus the concealed weapon.

ORDELL
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont
don't got a doin' time disposition.

MAX
I need your name and address.

ORDELL
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B-
I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton
90222.

MAX
House or apartment?

ORDELL
House.

MAX
Now I need you to count your money.

Ordell hands him the Lakers bag. Max takes the money out
putting it on the desk.

ORDELL
Hope you don't mind me askin' where
you keepin' my money till I get it
back. In your drawer?

Max begins counting it.

MAX
Across the street a Great Western.
It goes in a trust account. You'll
need to fill out an Application for
Appearance Bond, an Indemnity
Agreement, a Contingent Promissory
Note. That's the one, if Beaumont
skips and I go after him, you pay
the expenses.

ORDELL
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.
(he takes a pen out
of his pocket)
Where do I sign?

Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front of
Ordell. Max goes back to counting the money. Ordell reads
the first agreement then says;

ORDELL
(reading the form)
Hey, Max.

MAX
(still counting money)
Yes.

ORDELL
(still reading form)
I was wondering. What if before the
court date gets here, Beaumont gets
hit by a bus or something and dies.
(he puts the form
down and looks at
Max)
I get my money back, don't I?

CUT TO:

A BLACK FINGER

Pressing a BLACK BUTTON next to the name, "BEAUMONT
LIVINGSTON".

INT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT – NIGHT

BEAUMONT LIVINGSTON, wearing no shirt, sweatpants, and smoking
a fatty answers the intercom, which buzzes loudly. We can
hear JAY LENO interviewing a CELEBRITY on TV OFFSCREEN.

BEAUMONT
(into the speaker)
Who is it?

EXT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Ordell stands outside the security gate of Beaumont's
Hollywood apartment.

EXTREME CLOSEUP – Ordell's lips talking into the intercom
speaker.

ORDELL
It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me
up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP – Beaumont's finger pressing the entry button.

EXTREME CLOSEUP – The doorknob on the security gate, BUZZING.
Ordell's hand comes into frame twisting it open.

Beaumont opens his apartment door, fatty between his fingers.
He sees Ordell approach.

Ordell greets him, arms spread out in hug mode, with a big
smile across his face.

ORDELL
Look at you and your free ass. Come
over and give me a motherfuckin'
hug.

Ordell and Beaumont embrace.

BEAUMONT
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,
man. What the fuck can I say? Thank
you... thank you... thank you.

ORDELL
Who was there for your ass?

BEAUMONT
You were there for me.

ORDELL
Who?

BEAUMONT
You.

Laughing his hustler's laugh and bumping Beaumont's fist
hard.

ORDELL
You goddam right!

Beaumont laughs.

ORDELL
You see, it works like this. You get
your ass in trouble, I get your ass
out. That's my job. And I don't mind
tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.

BEAUMONT
I'm still scared as a motherfucker,
Ordell. They talkin' like they serious
'bout me doin' that machine gun time.

ORDELL
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a
fright in your ass.

BEAUMONT
If that's what they want to do,
they're doin' it.

ORDELL
How old is that machine gun shit?

BEAUMONT
Three years.

ORDELL
Three years. That crime's old, man.
They ain't got room in prison for
all the motherfuckers out there
killin' people. How they gonna find
room for you?

BEAUMONT
That's not what they're tellin' me.

ORDELL
That's why they call it "fuckin'
with ya." Now you wanna hear how we
retaliate?

Beaumont takes a hit off the fatty and nods his head.

ORDELL
Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to
Century City, meet my lawyer. Now
let me tell you a little bit about
my lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins
and this nigga is a junkyard dog!
He's my own private Johnie Cochran.
In fact, he'd kick Johnie Cochran's
ass. And like Johnie Cochran, dude
hates fuckin' cops. I'm serious,
this man lives to fuck with the
police. So as a favor, I had him
look at your case. Stacin told me
you ain't got shit to worry about.
They just fuckin' wit ya. So we sic
the junkyard dog on their ass, make
'em --
(he bumps fist with
Beaumont)
...Stop fuckin' wit ya!

Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.

BEAUMONT
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just --
you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin'
TV.

ORDELL
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I
was kinda hopin you could come with
me.

BEAUMONT
What'd ya mean?

ORDELL
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,
does a nigga a favor -- then BAM --
hits a nigga up for a favor in return.
But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda
nigga.

BEAUMONT
What?

ORDELL
I need a favor.

BEAUMONT
That requires me goin' out tonight?

ORDELL
A bit.

BEAUMONT
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on
goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock,
man. I'm home, I'm high --

ORDELL
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I
spent ten thousand dollars gittin'
your ass home.
(changes tone)
Look, I gotta problem. I need help,
and you can help me.

This has the desired effect.

TIME CUT:

WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR Beaumont comes out of
the apartment, sporting Nikes and a Queen Latifah t-shirt.
He locks his front door and walks with Ordell to his car.
They talk the whole way. We STEDICAM in front of them the
whole way.

BEAUMONT
What's the problem?

ORDELL
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
situation. Remember I sold those
three M-60 machine guns outta the
five I got?

BEAUMONT
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
This group of Koreans in Koreatown
have started a Neighborhood Watch
kinda thing. And they want a few
weapons so the neighborhood niggas
know they mean business. So I'm gonna
sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
Only problem, I ain't never dealt
with these Koreans before. Now I
ain't worried. Asians are by and
large real dependable. They don't
want no trouble. You might argue
about price, but you ain't gotta
worry about them shootin' you in the
back. But I got me kind of a rule.
Never do business with nobody you
ain't never done business with before
without backup. That's why I need
you, backup.

BEAUMONT
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out
nowhere --

ORDELL
Let me finish. Can I finish?

BEAUMONT
Go ahead.

CUT TO:

TRUNK

The trunk of a car is opened.

Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump action
shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part of any
Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as a playing
piece.

ORDELL
Now you're gonn be in the trunk
holding onto the shotgun.

And I'm going to tell them I'm opening up my trunk to show
'em my goods. I open up the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad
boy.

BEAUMONT
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'
anybody.

ORDELL
What the fuck I tell you. You don't
hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the
gun. They'll get the idea.

BEAUMONT
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll
be in there -- ten minutes.

BEAUMONT
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk
no minutes. Why don't I just ride
with you?

ORDELL
You can't ride with me. The surprise
effect is ninety percent of it.

BEAUMONT
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL
I can't believe you do me this way.

BEAUMONT
I ain't doin' you no way. I just
ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got
a problem with small places.

ORDELL
Well, my ass has got a problem
spending ten thousand dollars of my
own goddam money to get ungrateful,
peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I
do it --

BEAUMONT
Look, man, I know I owe you --

ORDELL
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in
the trunk.

BEAUMONT
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
be locked in the trunk of no car.

ORDELL
You think I wanted to spend ten
thousand dollars on your ass?

Beaumont starts to speak --

ORDELL
Answer the question, nigga. Do you
think I wanted to spend the thousand
dollars on your ass? Yes or no?

BEAUMONT
Course you didn't.

ORDELL
But the only way to help you was to
do that, so I did it.
(pause)
Okay, how 'bout this? After we're
through fuckin' with these Koreans,
I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and
Waffles. My treat.

Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.

ORDELL
Just think, man. That 'scoe's special,
smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
side of red beans and rice.
Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.

Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;

BEAUMONT
Now exactly how long I gotta be in
this motherfucker.

CUT TO:

TRUNK

Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid is
SLAMMED closed.

EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE – NIGHT

Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush interior
of the Olds and turns on the engine.

It comes to life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the
player inside the dash.

The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."

Cool, old-school R&B fills the cab.

Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and mouthing
the words.

He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...

...then stops.

Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab goes
black.

He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.

In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his right
hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the glovebox and
pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes the glovebox.

The cab goes black.

EXT. OLDSMOBILE – NIGHT

The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban nowhere.

Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and walks
to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the trunk and
says;

ORDELL
Don't worry. It's just me.

The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
shotgun.

ORDELL
I was wondering. Did any federal
people come visit you in jail and I
should be watching my ass?

Beaumont doesn't say anything.

ORDELL
You wouldn't tell me if they did and
I wouldn't blame you.

Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.

Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He racks
it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in the chest.
He goes back into he trunk.

Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the weapon
on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.

Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into the
cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B song
come back on, but VERY LOW.

Ordell drives the Olds away.

CUT TO:

INT. MOTEL – NIGHT

Louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room, flipping from
one channel to another with a remote control, drinking
cocktails from a can.

The phone rings. He answers it.

LOUIS
Hello.

INT. OLDSMOBILE (PARKED) – NIGHT

Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the Olds,
listening to soul music with his tiny cellular phone next to
his ear.

ORDELL
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?

LOUIS
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.

ORDELL
Whatcha watchin'?

LOUIS
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin'
back and forth. They had some black
girl from some black show on Jay
Leno. I watched that for a bit, but
I kept flippin channels cause I didn't
know who she was.

ORDELL
Guess where I am?

LOUIS
I dunno.

ORDELL
I know you don't know. I said guess.

LOUIS
The moon -- I dunno

ORDELL
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-
cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked
outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.

LOUIS
You're outside?

ORDELL
Uh-huh.

LOUIS
C'mon in.

ORDELL
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm
comfortable. I ain't about to walk
into that roach motel and get
uncomfortable. You bring your ass
out here.

LOUIS
I'm in my underwear.

ORDELL
Then put your goddam drawers on, and
get your ass out here. I got somethin'
to show you.

EXT. MOTEL – NIGHT

Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside his
room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked in front
of the motel.

As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side comes
down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back in his
seat looking up at Louis.

ORDELL
You know what your problem is, Louis?

Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
pockets.

ORDELL
You think you're a good guy. When
you go into a deal you don't go in
prepared to take that motherfucker
all the way. You go in looking for a
way out. And it ain't cause you're
scared neither. It's cause you think
you're a good guy, and you think
there's certain things a good guy
won't do. That's where we're
different, me and you. Cause me,
once I decide I want something, ain't
a goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna
stop me from gittin' it. I gotta use
a gun get what I want, I'm gonna use
a gun. Nigga gets in my way, nigga
gonna get removed. Understand what
I'm saying?

CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK

Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half his
head blown off.

Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then back
to Beaumont.

Ordell closes the trunk.

LOUIS
Who was that?

ORDELL
That was Beaumont.

LOUIS
Who was Beaumont?

ORDELL
An employee I had to let go.

LOUIS
What did he do?

ORDELL
He put himself in a situation where
he was gonna have to do ten years in
the penetentiary, that's what he
did.
(taking out a Viceroy
and lighting it up)
And if you know Beaumont, you know
there ain't no way in hell he can do
no ten years. And if you know that,
you know Beaumont's gonna go any
goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
from doin' those ten years including
telling the Federal government
everything they want to know about
my ass. Now that, my friend, is a
clear case of him or me. And you
best believe it ain't gonna be me.
You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna
come in on this with me, you gotta
be prepared to go all the way. I got
me so far over a half-a-million
dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a
bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr.
Walker make us one more delivery,
I'm gonna have me over a million.
You think I'm gonna let this little
cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that
up? Shit, you better think again.
'Fore I let this deal get fucked up,
I'll shoot that nigga in the head,
and ten niggas look just like em.
(pause)
Understand what I'm sayin'?

LOUIS
Yeah.

ORDELL
So we on the same page then?

LOUIS
I follow.

Ordell smiles (not his hustler smile, but a genuine smile).

Louis grins.

They both bump fists.

FADE TO BLACK:

TITLE CARD:

"JACKIE BROWN"

The sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be heard
underneath this...

INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT – DAY

A SUBTITLE READS:

"LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE"

We look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage at
LAX. Jackie Brown, the Cabo Air stewardess from the opening
credits, walks into frame. We dolly behind her as she walks
down the row of cars.

VOICE (O.S.)
Miss Brown.

She turns towards the voice/camera.

Young plainclothes cop, MARK DARGUS, walks up to her, holding
open his I.D. case.

DARGUS
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in
that bag?

JACKIE
The usual things. I'm a flight
attendant with Cabo Air.

Young plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET, enters the scene.

NICOLET
Can I be of some assistance?

As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her purse,
she says to Ray;

JACKIE
I doubt it.
(to Dargus)
Who's your friend?

DARGUS
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
Would you mind if we looked in that
bag?

Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter.

JACKIE
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?

DARGUS
You have the right to say "no." And
I have the right to make you wait
here with Ray while I go get a
warrant. And if I don't want to go
through all that trouble, I could
just take you in on suspicion.

JACKIE
Suspicion of what?

NICOLET
All he wants to do is peek in your
bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
anything.

Jackie shrugs and says;

JACKIE
Go ahead.

Dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement, gets down on his
haunches, and starts feeling through her things.

CLOSEUP FLIGHT BAG

A soiled blouse, uniform skirt, then a manila envelope, a
fat one, nine-by-twelve.

Jackie watches him straighten the clasp...

ENVELOPE

Opens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar
bills secured with rubberbands.

Nicolet whistles.

Dargus looks up at her.

DARGUS
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty
thousand dollars here. What would
you say Ray?

NICOLET
That looks like fifty thousand dollars
from here.

JACKIE

Not saying anything at the moment.

DARGUS
This is your money?

JACKIE
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."

Dargus smiles.

DARGUS
You should know if you bring in
anything over ten thousand you have
to declare it. You forgot or what?
You could get a two hundred and fifty
thousand dollar fine, plus two years
in prison. Now you want to talk to
us about it, or you want to talk to
Customs?

JACKIE
I'm not saying another word.

NICOLET
Listen, Jackie, hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
Something about that job makes them
kinda hard to get along with. Now,
do you want to talk with a bunch of
suspicious, disagreeable people like
them, or a couple good-hearted guys
like Mark and myself.

Nicolet smiles.

CLOSEUP JACKIE

Doesn't smile back.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP JACKIE

Sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives. Jackie
lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP until noted.

INT. DARGUS OFFICE – DAY

DARGUS (O.S.)
Hey, this is my office. There's no
smoking.

JACKIE
Arrest me.

Nicolet laughs.

DARGUS (O.S.)
We could, smart ass... or we could
work out what's known as a Substantial
Assistance Agreement. That is if
you're willing to cooperate. Tell us
who gave you the money and who you're
giving it to.

Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.

NICOLET (O.S.)
You got a good lawyer?

DARGUS (O.S.)
Can she afford a good one is the
question. Otherwise she'll be in
Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
the Public Defender gets around to
her.

NICOLET (O.S.)
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
Livingston?

Not a word.

NICOLET
Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
did know you, Beaumont was found in
the trunk of a car -- dead. Shot
twice. Once in the head and once in
the chest.

Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."

NICOLET
I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
yesterday. You see, like you, Beaumont
found himself in some hot water. He
was looking at ten years he was pretty
sure he didn't want to do and was
understandably concerned. Now maybe
you don't know Beaumont, but Beaumont
knew you, and maybe so does the guy
who blew Beaumont's head off.

Not a word.

DARGUS (O.S.)
If you don't want to talk to us, I
guess we'll just have to hand you
over to Customs.

Jackie puts out her cigarette.

JACKIE
Okay, let's go.

She stares down the cops.

DARGUS AND NICOLET

We cut to the detective and the special agent for the first
time in the scene.

DARGUS
You know, Miss Brown, there's
basically three types of people that
we come along in the performance of
our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
Victims, witnesses, innocent
bystanders... You ain't any of these.
Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
sonabitches have dedicated their
lives to a life outside the law.
That ain't you either. Where you
belong is the third category. The
category we refer to as LOSERS.

Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just says
without expression;

JACKIE
I'm not a loser.

DARGUS
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
flying for TWA and got busted for
carrying drugs. You were carrying
them for a pilot husband of yours.
He did time and you got off. But
that ended your career with the big
airlines. Cut to thirteen years later.
You're forty-four years of age. You're
flying for the shittiest little
shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican
airline that there is. Where you
make a whopping twelve-thousand
dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
lot to show for a twenty year career.
And to top it off, you're going to
jail. Now true, the judge, even with
your prior, will probably only give
you a year or two. But this doesn't
seem like the time of life you got
years to throw away.
(pause)
Now, we don't like trying losers
like they're criminals. But in the
absence of a criminal, we will try
you. Now, wasn't this money given to
you by an American living in Mexico
by the name of Cedric Walker?

Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.

Nicolet joins back in.

NICOLET
You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
for talkin', either. Yeah, he told
us about you and Mr. Walker, but
whoever the hell it was he worked
for out here, he wouldn't say. Could
it be the same person you were
supposed to deliver this money to?

Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.

Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on it.

DARGUS
I'd like your permission to open
this again. So we'll know exactly
how much money we're talkin' about
here.

Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk, unzips
the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops it on the
desk.

JACKIE
Help yourself.

DARGUS
While you're at it, let me see what
else is in there. You mind?

She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.

JACKIE
My pocketbook.

DARGUS
What's in it?

JACKIE
Beauty products.

Nicolet takes the manila envelope.

NICOLET
I'll count the money.

Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and packets
in it.

DARGUS
What's this?

JACKIE
That's my diet shit.

Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.

DARGUS
Let's see what else is in there.

Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope. His
expression changes to a shit-eating grin.

NICOLET
Oh, Miss Brown?

JACKIE
Yeah?

Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
half-inch or so of white powder inside.

NICOLET
And what would this be, Sweet and
Low?

JACKIE
What the fuck is that shit?

NICOLET
I know what it looks like.

JACKIE
You planted that shit on me.

Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.

JACKIE
Look, that shit ain't mine.

NICOLET
(to Dargus)
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
how 'bout Posession with the Intent
to Distribute?

DARGUS
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
all the cash, I think I could go
with Conspiracy to Traffic.

JACKIE
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'
about that fuckin' shit.

NICOLET
Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
have a seat and tell us who might
know something about this fuckin'
shit.

Jackie just looks at the two grinning Cheshire cats as the
balance of power rolls over on her.

CUT TO:

EXT. TORRANCE MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE – DAY

A Los Angeles County Jail bus pulls up behind the Torrance
Court House.

INT. COUNTY JAIL BUS – DAY

Jackie, now wearing County Jail blues, sits next to another
BLACK WOMAN. Their hands cuffed together.

The bus stops. A rough-looking FEMALE COUNTY SHERIFF unlocks
the gate that encloses the prisoners. Then explains in a you-
better-do-exactly-what-I-say manner, how they're going to
leave the bus.

EXT. COUNTY JAIL BUS – DAY

MANY WOMEN, including Jackie, all wearing county blues and
handcuffed to each other, exit the bus.

The SHERIFFS lead them into the back entrance to the court
house.

INT. HALLWAY COURTHOUSE – DAY

Dargus and Nicolet confer with the PUBLIC DEFENDER, an
attractive blonde woman in a nice business suit.

DARGUS
If she'll cooperate with us, we'll
turn possession with intent into
plain ol' Possession, and she can
bond outta here for one thousand
bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll
go for the Intent and request a twenty-
five-thousand dollar bond.

INT. COURTROOM – DAY

Jackie and the Public Defender. Jackie, in her county blues;
Public Defender in her nice suit.

JACKIE
You tell those guys they'll have to
do one helluva lot better than that
before I'll even say 'hi' to them.

PUBLIC DEFENDER
Well, that's the State's offer. If
you plead to possession and tell
L.A.P.D. what they want to know,
your bond will be set at one-thousand
dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will
request one at twenty-five thousand
based on your prior record and risk
of flight. If you don't post it or
don't know anyone who can, you'll
spend six to eight weeks in County
before your arraignment comes up.

JACKIE
Who's side are you on?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
I beg your pardon?

JACKIE
What if I plead guilty?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
And cooperate? You might get
probation.

JACKIE
If I don't cooperate?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
With the prior? You could get anywhere
from a year to five depending on the
judge. You want to think about it?
You got two minutes before we're up.

COURT IN SESSION

It's a full schedule in court today. Jackie sits with a bunch
of other females wearing county blues in the defendant's
area (where the jury sits during a jury trial)

Dargus and Nicolet sit in the courtroom.

The JUDGE reads the next case.

JUDGE
Brown. Case number 700324.

Jackie rises amongst the other defendants.

The P.D. rises.

Dargus, the arresting officer, rises.

JUDGE
The charge is possession of Narcotics
with the Intent to Distribute. How
does your client plead?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
She wishes to stand mute, your honor.

JUDGE
Very well...
(to Dargus)
...Detective Dargus -- You're the
arresting officer in his case,
correct?

DARGUS
That's correct, your honor.

JUDGE
You have a recommendation for bail?

DARGUS
Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
defendant's prior conviction and the
extreme possibility of flight due to
her occupation, the State requests a
bond of no less than twenty-five
thousand.

The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie...

JUDGE
I'll set bond at ten thousand and
set the date of August 14th for the
arraignment.

JACKIE
When is that, your honor?

JUDGE
That's six weeks from now, Miss Brown.
We'll continue this matter then.
Owens, case 72242.

Jackie sits down.

Dargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle
together.

Jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking pisses
her off.

DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a perspective
from the back of the courtroom.

We see Jackie in the defendant's area.

We see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way
out of the courtroom.

ORDELL

Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any
expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out of
the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME.

FADE TO BLACK:

TITLE CARD

"MAX CHERRY"

FADE UP ON:

INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE – DAY

The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush
behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges, zipping
up his pants with a TV guide in his hand.

He looks up and stops dead.

Ordell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of
Max's desk.

ORDELL
Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear
you wash your hands.

Max looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his desk.

MAX
Comfortable?

ORDELL
The door was opened, so I just came
right in.

MAX
I can see that. Why?

ORDELL
I got some more business for ya.

MAX
Oh, yeah? What did he do?

ORDELL (O.S.)
She is an airline stewardess. Got
caught coming back from Mexico with
some blow. They set her bond this
afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
I was thinkin', you could use the
ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont
and move it over on to the stewardess.

MAX
The bond for possession is only a
thousand.

ORDELL
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
it Possession with Intent. A black
woman in her forties gets busted
with less than two ounces on her,
they call that shit Intent. Same
shit happened to a movie star. It's
Possession.

MAX
It still sounds high.

ORDELL
She had, I believe it was... fifty
grand on her, too. There was a cop
at the hearing. Young guy with
L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty-
five thousand, saying there was a
risk of flight. Jackie being a
stewardess and all.

MAX
Before we start talking about
stewardess, let's get Beaumont out
of the way first.

Sitting back in the chair -- almost grinning -- but not quite.

ORDELL
Somebody already did.

MAX
What?

ORDELL
You didn't hear?

MAX
Hear what?

ORDELL
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's
brains out -- hey, that rhymes --
blew Beaumont's brains out.

MAX
Did the police contact you?

ORDELL
Very first motherfuckin' thing they
did. They see I put up a big money
bond on my boy, they start thinking
with that where-there's-smoke-there's
fire logic. They roust my ass outta
bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona,
half to death. She thought they were
gonna take my ass away for sure.

MAX
The stewardess. Do you know her last
name?

ORDELL
(smiles)
Brown, Jackie Brown.

MAX
What does she do for you?

ORDELL
Who says she does anything for me?
She's my friend. When my friends get
into trouble, I like to help 'em
out.

MAX
Beaumont worked for you.

ORDELL
That's what the police thought. I
told them I'm unemployed, how could
I have anybody work for me? Now I
bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have
the police on me again, huh? Wanting
to know was she doing things for me,
was she bringing me that money!

MAX
Was she?

ORDELL
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-
client relationship? The lawyer can't
tell nothing he hears?

MAX
You're not my client until you get
busted and I bond you out.

ORDELL
If there's no -- what do you call it --
confidentiality between us? Why would
I tell you anything?

MAX
Cause you want me to know what a
slick guy you are. You got
stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.

ORDELL
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
grand?

MAX
You want me to speculate on what you
do. I'd say you're in the drug
business, except the money's moving
in the wrong direction. Whatever
you're into, you seem to be getting
away with it, so more power to you.
Okay you want another bond, and you
want to move over the ten thousand
you put down on Beaumont to the
stewardess. That means paperwork. I
have to get a death certificate,
present it to the court, fill out a
receipt for return of bond collateral,
then type up another application. An
indemnity agreement --

ORDELL
Jackie ain't got time for all that
shit --

MAX
I'm telling you what I have to do.
What you have to do, in case you
forgot, is come up with premium of a
thousand bucks.

ORDELL
I got it. I just don't got it on me.

MAX
Well, come back when you do, and
I'll bond out the stewardess.

ORDELL
Man, you know I'm good for it.
Thousand bucks ain't shit.

MAX
If I don't see it in front of me,
you're right. It ain't shit.

ORDELL
Man, you need to look at this with a
little compassion. Jackie ain't no
criminal. She ain't used to this
kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
don't give a fuck -- but for the
average citizen, coupla nights in
County fuck with your mind.

MAX
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
don't have a tab.

ORDELL
Just listen for a second. We got a
forty-year-old, gainfully employed
black woman, falsely accused --

MAX
Falsely accused? She didn't come
back from Mexico with cocaine on
her?

ORDELL
Falsely accused of Intent. If she
had that shit -- and mind you, I
said "if" -- it was just her shit to
get high with.

MAX
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.

ORDELL
Okay, man. I got your money. But
don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'
favor.

INT. MAX'S CADILLAC (MOVING) – NIGHT

It's early evening; and Max's powder-blue Seville is driving
to the County Jail with a client, a young Hispanic woman of
twenty named ANITA.

MAX
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation
officer. Karen's a good kid, but
she's mad at you, because you lied
to her. This business about your
grandmother's funeral

ANITA
I went. I did. I took my mother and
little brother.

MAX
But you didn't ask permission. You
broke a trust. If you had asked,
Karen probably would have let you.
I'm sure she would.

ANITA
I know. That's why I went.

MAX
But then you told her you were home.

ANITA
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I
could go.

Max gives up.

MAX
I don't know. Maybe it's a language
problem.
(getting stern)
Anita, you ever cause this much
heartache over something that could
easily be avoided, I'll never write
you again. You understand?

ANITA
I understand.

MAX
I mean it. I don't care how many
times your mother calls or how much
she cries.

Like an exasperated teenager.

ANITA
I understand.

MAX
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."

ANITA
Yes, Max, I understand.

INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL – NIGHT

POV THROUGH A WIRE MESH CAGE

Max and Anita, side by side. Anita's hands are cuffed behind
her back.

MAX
Dropping off and picking up. Dropping
off Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,
Jackie.

We're at the admitting desk of the L.A. County Jail. Max
undoes Anita's handcuffs, while a SHERIFF waits to take her
away.

ANITA
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?

MAX
I'll call her.

ANITA
Won't forget?

MAX
I won't forget.

She kisses Max on the cheek and the Sheriff takes her away.

ANITA
Thanks, Max. See you later.

Max puts the cuffs away, sits on a bench, takes out a Len
Deighton paperback and begins to read.

FADE TO BLACK:

FADE UP:

MAX

Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S voice.

SHERIFF (O.S.)
Max! Here she comes.

Max puts his book down and see -- Jackie being led into the
Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS. She's wearing her stewardess
uniform and carrying a small envelope with her belongings in
it and her shoes. When Max was imagining a woman in her
forties, he had someone with a bit of wear and tear on them
in mind.

But this Jackie Brown's a knockout.

As he watches her, she steps out of the County Jail slippers
she was wearing and slips into her shoes.

He approaches, handing her his card.

MAX
Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm
your bail bondsman.

She takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing.

MAX
I can give you a lift home if you'd
like?

JACKIE
Okay.

INT. MAX'S CADILLAC – NIGHT

Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;

JACKIE
Are you really a bail bondsman?

MAX
Who do you think I am?

She doesn't answer.

MAX
I gave you my card there.

JACKIE
Can I see your I.D.?

MAX
You're serious?

She waits.

Max digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her, then
reaches up and turns on the light above them for her to see.

MAX'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

JACKIE
Who put up my bond? Ordell?

MAX
In cash.

She looks straight ahead.

Max shifts into drive.

Max rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY comes
out of the gatehouse and hands through the window Max's .38
revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy his pass in
exchange for the gun, says "thanks", then puts the .38 in
his glovebox in front of Jackie. He drives on.

MAX AND JACKIE (MOVING)

JACKIE
Can we stop for cigarettes?

MAX
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?

JACKIE
I don't think so.

MAX
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.

JACKIE
Couldn't we just stop at a seven-
eleven?

MAX
I thought you might want a drink?

JACKIE
I'd love one, but not there.

MAX
We could stop at the Hilton by the
airport.

JACKIE
Is it dark?

MAX
It's kind of a sports bar

JACKIE
That doesn't sound dark.

MAX
Why does it need to be dark?

JACKIE
'Cause I look like I just got outta
jail, that's why. You droppin' me
off at home, right? There's a place
by me.

MAX
Great.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE COCKATOO INN – NIGHT

A big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick inn.

INT. THE COCKATOO INN – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – A KNOB is pulled out.

Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from the
bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to join
Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to return.

The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A dark
and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of Hawthorne
Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess lives (about
ten minutes from LAX)

The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd and
an even older white crowd who'd been coming here years before
it became a black bar.

A JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R&B.

Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by a
bar candle in a red glass thing.

Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks white
wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to Max.

MAX
No thanks, I quit three years ago.

As she lights her cigarette.

JACKIE
You gain weight?

MAX
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it
back on.

JACKIE
That's why I don't quit. If I can't
fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time gettin' my brand.

MAX
What's your brand?

JACKIE
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.
They're hard to find here. I was
locked up with the last two getting
legal advice from a woman who was in
for bustin' her boyfriend's head
open with a baseball bat.

MAX
Was she helpful?

JACKIE
She was more helpful than the fuckin'
Public Defender.
(she takes a sip of
wine)
I don't know -- I guess what I need
is a lawyer, find out what my options
are.

MAX
You know, I figured out the other
day I've written something like
fifteen thousand bonds since I've
been in the business. I'd say about
eighty percent of them were at least
drug related. If you want, I can
help you look at your options.

Jackie takes the talk in a different direction.

JACKIE
You're not tired of it?

MAX
(smiles)
I am, as a matter of fact.

A moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.

MAX
What have they told you?

JACKIE
So far I've been told I can cooperate
and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
stand mute and get as much as five
years. Does that sound right?

MAX
I'd say if you're tried and found
guilty you won't get more than a
year and a day. That's State time.
Prison.

JACKIE
(under her breath)
Shit.

MAX
But they won't want to take you to
trial. They'll offer you simple
Possession, a few months of County
time, and a year or two probation.
(pointing to her drink)
How 'bout another?

JACKIE
Sure.

Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named ROWEN
for two more.

MAX
You know who put the dope in your
bag?

JACKIE
Yeah, but that's not what this was
about. They were fuckin waitin' for
my ass. They knew I had that money,
they even knew the amount. The one
who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
"Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
here. What would you say?" But all
they could do was threaten me and
hand me over to Customs, and I could
tell they didn't want to do that.

MAX
They wanted you to tell them what
you know.

JACKIE
I had 'em too. I burnt those two
Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
Then their asses lucked out and found
that coke.

MAX
What did they want to know?

JACKIE
Who gave me the money and who I was
giving it to. And some guy they found
in a trunk with his head blown off.
Said it was him who told them 'bout
me.

The Waitress comes with the drinks.

ROWEN
Can I get you two some popcorn?

MAX
No, thanks.

Rowen exits.

MAX
That would be Beaumont Livingston.

JACKIE
That's him. How do you know 'em?

MAX
I wrote him on Monday. They found
him dead on Tuesday.

JACKIE
Ordell pick up his bond?

MAX
Same as you. Ten thousand.

JACKIE
The federal agent kinda half hinted
Ordell might of done Beaumont.

MAX
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
but you didn't mention the Federal.

JACKIE
I didn't?

MAX
No, you didn't. What branch?

JACKIE
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms.

Max puts it together.

MAX
He's the one who wants you.

JACKIE
It was the other guy who busted me.

MAX
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
hell bonding out of federal court.
He doesn't want you mad at him, he
wants you to tell him what you know.
He uses you to get a line on Ordell,
make a case, then take him federal.
You know what Ordell's into?

JACKIE
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's
smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
be interested in.

Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in her
mind and makes a decision.

JACKIE
I used to bring over ten thousand at
a time. That's the legal limit, so I
never brought more than that.

MAX
How many trips did you make?

JACKIE
With ten thousand? Nine.

MAX
He's got that kinda money?

JACKIE
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
bank. But he's got a problem. He's --
what do you call it when you got
money, but don't have cash?

MAX
Cash poor?

JACKIE
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept
on me till I finally said okay. I'll
bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
twelve envelope. I got paid five
hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
Walker, in Mexico gave me the
envelope.

MAX
If you knew bringing anything over
ten thousand was against the law,
why not pack a hundred grand?

Jackie gets exasperated.

JACKIE
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
and not hit you in the face if the
bag was opened. This ain't solvin'
my problem. I gotta figure out a way
to either keep my job or get out of
trouble. I'm off today, but if I
can't leave the country I'm out of a
job. And if I don't got a job, I
can't hire a lawyer.

MAX
Ask A.T.F. They might give you
permission.

JACKIE
Yeah, if I cooperate.

MAX
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
gonna have to give 'em something.

JACKIE
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
name -- I don't really know shit
about what he does or how he does it --
That don't give me much to bargain
with.

MAX
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
Show a willingness to be helpful.
You want to stay out of jail, don't
you?

Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.

MAX
What'dya think?

CLOSEUP JACKIE

JACKIE
I think maybe I have more options
than I thought.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP: ORDELL

Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street from
Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny Cash is
playing inside his car.

EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX – NIGHT

ORDELL'S POV

Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue Cadillac
Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets out, then
bends down and talks to him through the window of the
passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture and turns,
walking into her apartment complex. Max drives off.

ORDELL

While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little Targa
.22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the pistol
into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him as he walks
across the street to Jackie's apartment.

Once inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.

He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a moment,
then Jackie opens the door.

ORDELL
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?

JACKIE
I was expecting you. Come in.

Jackie holds the door open for him.

INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in the
living room.

ORDELL
You got some booze?

Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
frightened.

JACKIE
I got some vodka in the freezer.

ORDELL
Got some o.j.?

JACKIE
Yeah.

Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.

ORDELL
Well, then, why don't you be a good
hostess and make me a screwdriver?

JACKIE
Sure.

Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
doesn't turn on the light.

ORDELL
You gonna thank me?

Taking a glass from the cupboard.

JACKIE
For what?

ORDELL
Who you think got your ass outta
jail?

Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes and
taking out vodka.

JACKIE
The same guy who put me in, thanks a
lot.

ORDELL
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's
your business.

Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She takes
out orange juice, then closes the door.

JACKIE
It wasn't mine.

Ordell has to stop and think.

Jackie makes screwdriver.

ORDELL
Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
apologize. I 'magine they asked you
a shitload of questions about it,
huh? All that money, want to know
where you got it?

Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell handing
him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell takes it,
continues to look at Jackie.

ORDELL
I'magine they asked who you givin'
it to, too.

JACKIE
They asked.

ORDELL
And what was your answer?

JACKIE
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

ORDELL
You positive about that? You weren't
nervous and let something slip by
mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
just gotta know.

Jackie says to his face;

JACKIE
You're not asking the right questions.

Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
then moves by the door, still standing and looking at Ordell
in the kitchen doorway.

JACKIE
Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL
I knew it.

JACKIE
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.

Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.

ORDELL
Yeah?

JACKIE
I didn't tell 'em anything.

Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.

ORDELL
My name come up?

Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."

Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
gloved hands on her shoulders.

ORDELL
You say anything about me?

Jackie shakes her head "no."

ORDELL
Well, that's mighty honorable of
you.

Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
his, but still shows no fear.

ORDELL
This fella Beaumont, they say what
happened to him?

JACKIE
They told me.

At this moment the film becomes a:

SPLIT SCREEN

On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max driving
home in his Seville.

MAX IN CAR

Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his face.
He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the night she'd
have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying; "WE COULD HAVE
FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him with the look,
making a judgment and what it said was; "I COULD USE YOU".
Either way it was a turn-on.

Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in Torrance.

ORDELL AND JACKIE

ORDELL
Yeah, somebody musta been real mad
at Beaumont. Or they were afraid of
what he might say to keep from doin'
some time. I'magine from time-to-
time they asked you a whole shitload
of questions. And you didn't give
'em no answer?

Jackie shakes her head from side to side.

Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle of
her throat.

ORDELL
You scared of me?

Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
leaving his. Reaches over the seat.

ORDELL
You got a reason to be nervous with
me?

With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the woman's
eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard the fuck
against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.

Ordell hears a CLICK.

Can't believe it.

MAX IN CAR

Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...

THE GLOVE BOX

The gun is gone.

MAX
Where is it?

A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL'S CROTCH

ORDELL
Is that what I think it is?

JACKIE
What do you think it is?

CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH

ORDELL
I think it's a gun pressing against
my dick.

JACKIE
You thought right... Now take your
hands from around my throat, nigga.

Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.

END OF SPLIT SCREEN

Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and pushes
him against the wall.

ORDELL
What the hell you doin'?

JACKIE
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!

Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him the
way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his pocket

ORDELL
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
with you. I just carry that. You
been listenin' to them cops too much.

JACKIE
The cops didn't try and strangle my
ass.

ORDELL
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin'
with you.

JACKIE
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
gonna unload both these motherfuckers,
you don't do what I tell you.
Understand what I'm saying?

ORDELL
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves
both guns in Ordell's back.

JACKIE
I said, you understand what I'm saying

ORDELL
I understand woman, damn!

JACKIE
Go sit over in that chair.

Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch. Ordell
still tries bullshit...

ORDELL
I'm tellin' you, those cops been
fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
black against black, that's how they
do.

JACKIE
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
down.

Ordell sits.

JACKIE
Put both hands behind your head.

Ordell does...

ORDELL
This shit's gettin' silly now...

Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.

JACKIE
I gotta tell you to shut up one more
time, I'm gonna shut you up.

Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each hand,
both pointed dead at Ordell.

A coffee table lays between them.

Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...

ORDELL
I just came here to talk.

JACKIE
Way I see it, me and you only got
one thing to talk about. What you
willing to do for me?

Ordell looks at her a moment and says;

ORDELL
Well, I can get you a good lawyer --

Jackie shakes her head "no!"

JACKIE
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
later they're gonna get around to
offering me a plea deal, and you
know that. That's why you came here
to kill me.

ORDELL
Baby, I didn't --

JACKIE
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's
say if I tell on you, I walk. And if
I don't, I go to jail.

Ordell, very interested.

ORDELL
Yeah?

JACKIE
One hundred thousand put in an escrow
account in my name, if I'm convicted
up to a year, or put on probation.
If I have to do more than a year,
you pay another hundred thousand.

Ordell just takes in what the woman said.

ORDELL
I got a problem...

JACKIE
All your money's in Mexico.

Ordell has to smile at the woman.

ORDELL
Yeah.

JACKIE
I been thinkin about that, too, and
I got me a idea.

TIME CUT:

DOORWAY Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
into FRAME, and talks with him.

JACKIE
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
tell you if it's on.

ORDELL (O.S.)
Talk to you tomorrow.

Ordell leaves.

Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.

FADE TO BLACK:

OVER BLACK

We hear a knock-knock on the door.

FADE UP ON:

SAME SHOT DORWAY

Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME and
opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera visitor;

JACKIE
You want your gun, don't you? Come
in. I'll go get it.

She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door behind
him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised and a touch
pissed at the nonchalantness.

As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he thinks
about hauling her ass back to the stockade. That'll change
her expression, he'd bet.

She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort of
sad smile.

JACKIE
Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
asked to borrow it you'd say no.
You'd have to. Would you like some
coffee?

Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
completely, leaving only curiosity.

MAX
If you're having some.

JACKIE
I am. Have a seat.

Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits at
the dining table off of the kitchen.

MAX
You get a chance to use it?

JACKIE
I felt a lot safer having it. My
milk went bad when I was in jail.

MAX
Black's fine.

She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
coffee in it.

MAX
You want to hang on to it awhile? It
wouldn't be legal, but if it makes --

Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.

JACKIE
Thanks, but I have my own now.

MAX
You went out this morning and bought
a gun?

She turns off the water.

JACKIE
What, I couldn't hear you?

MAX
You went out this morning and bought
a gun.

Pouring water into the coffee machine.

JACKIE
Let's just say I got one, okay?

She turns on the coffeemaker.

MAX
Somebody loan it to you?

JACKIE
Yeah.

Jackie leaves the kitchen.

Max's eyes follow her to the living room.

JACKIE
Want to hear some music?

MAX
Sure.

Jackie bends her knees and goes through a stack of records
leaned up against the wall on the floor.

JACKIE
I couldn't wait till I got home last
night and wash my hair.

MAX
It looks nice.

She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo turntable.

MAX
You never got into the whole CD
revolution?

JACKIE
I got a few. But I can't afford to
start all over again. I got too much
time and money invested in my records.

The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number from
the early seventies.

MAX
Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
records.

Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.

JACKIE
I don't buy new stuff that often.

Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
cigarette and stands.

Max listens to the soul song.

MAX
This is pretty.

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

MAX
Who is this?

JACKIE
The Delfonics.

MAX
'76?

JACKIE
'74, I think.

MAX
It's nice.

They listen for a moment.

JACKIE
I called in sick this morning. As
far as the airline knows, I'm still
available.

MAX
Are you?

JACKIE
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk
with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
what you suggested. Offer to help
and see what happens.

MAX
What I meant was have a lawyer do
the negotiating for you.

JACKIE
I want to talk to them first. I know
more now about Ordell's money.

MAX
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
who wants you, that'll only interest
him up to a point.

JACKIE
It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
million dollars. All of it in Cabo
in safe deposit boxes and more comin'
in.

MAX
How'd you find that out?

JACKIE
He told me last night.

MAX
He called you?

JACKIE
He came by.

MAX
What?... What'd you do?

JACKIE
We talked.

Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there, but
not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.

JACKIE
He had his doubts at first. But he's
always trusted me an wants more than
anything to believe he still can.

MAX
Why?

JACKIE
He needs me. Without me all that
money is just gonna sit over there
in Cabo. Sugar?

MAX
No thanks. There's gotta be other
ways to get it out.

She pours the coffee.

JACKIE
Maybe, but I'm the only one he's
ever used. He can't trust his other
people. They're crooks. He can try
bringing it in himself, but Ordell
sure don't want to go through no
Customs line. Either he recruits
another Cabo stewardess, or he
continues to trust me. I made him
feel he still can.

Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and sits
down.

MAX
How do you get it out?

JACKIE
Same way I been doin', but first
they got to let me go back to work.

MAX
You're gonna offer to set him up?

JACKIE
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
'em.

MAX
It's very possible Ordell's killed
somebody.

JACKIE
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
doin' that probation thing again.

Max watches her a moment Jackie takes a drink of coffee.

JACKIE
How do you feel about getting old?

MAX
You're not old. You look great.

JACKIE
I'm asking how you feel. Does it
bother you?

MAX
It's not really something I think
about.

JACKIE
Really?

MAX
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about
my hair. It started falling out ten
years ago. So I did something about
it.

JACKIE
How'd you feel about it?

MAX
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
done it, I did it to feel better
about myself, and I do. When I look
in the mirror it looks like me.

JACKIE
It's different with men.

MAX
You know, I can't really feel too
sorry for you in that department.

Jackie smiles.

MAX
In fact, I'd make a bet that except
possibly for an Afro --- you look
exactly the same as you did at twenty
nine.

Jackie smiles into her coffee.

JACKIE
My ass ain't the same.

MAX
Bigger?

JACKIE
Yeah.

Max smiles.

MAX
Nothin wrong with that.

Jackie's smile grows bigger.

MAX
Does something else worry you?

JACKIE
I just feel like I'm always starting
over. You said how many bonds you
wrote?

MAX
Fifteen thousand.

JACKIE
Well, I've flown seven million miles.
And I've been waitin' on people almost
twenty years. The best job I could
get after my bust was Cabo Air, which
is about the worst job you can get
in this industry. I make about sixteen
thousand, with retirement benefits,
ain't worth a damn. And now with
this arrest hanging over my head,
I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta
start all over again, but I got
nothin' to start over with. I'll be
stuck with whatever I can get. And
that scares me more than Ordell.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT – DAY

A.T.F. man, Ray Nicolet, moves down the hallway of the big
building... then heads for the office of Mark Dargus.

He reaches the closed door... raps on it.

DARGUS (O.S.)
Come in.

Nicolet opens the door, revealing Dargus and Jackie Brown
sitting in the office talking.

DARGUS
Great, you're here.

NICOLET
Hey, Jackie.

Jackie waves.

Dargus stands up and says to Jackie;

DARGUS
Let me have a word outside with Agent
Nicolet for a moment?

JACKIE
Take your time.

DARGUS
Thanks.

NICOLET
We'll just be a minute.

JACKIE
Can I smoke?

DARGUS
Go ahead.

The two detectives step outside and close the door on Jackie
as she pulls out her cigarettes.

NICOLET
What's going on?

DARGUS
She wants to make a deal.

NICOLET
She sound scared?

DARGUS
She almost sounds scared.

NICOLET
What's she want?

DARGUS
She wants to go back to work.

NICOLET
What's she willing to give us?

DARGUS
She hasn't one into specifics yet,
she's been waiting for you.

NICOLET
She knows it's my case?

DARGUS
She ain't said it, but she's not
stupid, she knows it's you who wants
her.

CLOSEUP JACKIE

Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven.

Dargus and Nicolet come back inside.

NICOLET
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell
me, what can we do for you?

JACKIE
I need permission to leave the country
so I keep my job.

NICOLET
We can look into that.

JACKIE
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show
up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.

NICOLET
You know what we want.

JACKIE
If I'm working, I can help you.

DARGUS
Help us do what?

JACKIE
Help you get Ordell Robbie.

NICOLET
Oh, so now you know him?

JACKIE
You never asked me if I did or not.

DARGUS
But now you're telling us now you
do.

JACKIE
'Course I do -- I deliver money for
him.

NICOLET
No shit. You know how he makes his
money?

JACKIE
He sells guns.

NICOLET
You ever see him sell guns?

JACKIE
No.

NICOLET
Then how do you know he sells guns?

JACKIE
He told me. Besides, why else would
an A.T.F. man be after him?

NICOLET
How can you help us?

JACKIE
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do
everything I can to help you throw
his ass in jail. And in exchange for
my help, I need permission to leave
the country and immunity.

DARGUS
You don't want much, do you?

JACKIE
Can you do it or not?

The two cops look at each other.

DARGUS
(to Nicolet)
It's your call.

Nicolet looks at Jackie.

NICOLET
It's possible.

FADE TO BLACK:

TITLE CARD:

"LOUIS GARA & MELANIE"

CUT TO:

FADE UP ON ON TV

Helmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper,
proclaiming he's the "mad dog."

The film is an Italian Policier from the seventies.

Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs hanging
over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up a big bong
with it's own handle. He takes a hit. Melanie's dressed in
her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts and a loose top.

The front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through it
carrying shopping bags.

ORDELL
We're back.

MELANIE
'Ola!

We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new "look"
is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black jeans.

Melanie notices the change.

MELANIE
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's
got some new clothes.

ORDELL
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy
running around lookin' like a bum on
the street.

LOUIS
I didn't look like a bum.

ORDELL
But you did have a Salvation Army-
thing going.

Ordell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the
air.

ORDELL
Goddam, girl. You gettin' high
already. It's only two o'clock.

Melanie smiles.

MELANIE
It's that late?

Louis sits on the couch. He smiles at the comeback.

ORDELL
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too
much of that shit. That shit robs
you of your ambition.

MELANIE
Not if your ambition is to get high
and watch TV.

Melanie and Louis laugh.

The phone rings.

ORDELL
You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs,
ain't ya.
(he moves towards the
phone -- to Melanie)
Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.

He picks it up.

ORDELL
Hello.
(pause)
Hey, Jackie...
(throwing a hard look
at Melanie)
No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.

MELANIE
I was gonna tell you...

Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.

Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble," all
the while smiling like a shark.

Louis smiles to himself.

Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.

Ordell's on the phone.

ORDELL
No, not on the phone, let's meet
somewhere. But you gotta make sure
they ain't followin' you...

Louis has the bong in front of him.

Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.

LOUIS
Is it ready to go?

MELANIE
Yeah, there's another hit left.

Louis takes it.

Ordell's on the phone.

INT. COCKATOO INN

Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see both
sides.

JACKIE
The Cockatoo Inn.

ORDELL
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?

JACKIE
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard
and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's
red brick...

ORDELL
Oh, wait, you mean that place that
has the big sign with a rooster on
it?

JACKIE
It's a cockatoo.

Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.

MELANIE
You okay?

LOUIS
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
smoke or laugh now it seems without
coughing.

MELANIE
Coughing opens up the capillaries.
When you cough, you're getting air --
in this case smoke -- to parts of
the lung that don't normally get
used. Coughing's good -- gets ya
higher. My dad coughs when he smokes
all the time.

Ordell hangs up the phone.

ORDELL
(to Louis)
Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
So since you like gettin' high so
much, why don't you stay here with
Melanie, get high, and watch cartoons?

Louis with a smile.

LOUIS
Way ahead of you.

Melanie laughs.

Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station till
he finds a channel with cartoons.

ORDELL
So you just watch this for the next
three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
when I'm through with all my business,
I'll get high. I get high at night.
Walk me to the door, space girl.

Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the door,
Ordell says to her in the doorway;

ORDELL
Hope you don't mind keeping him
company.

MELANIE
No problem.

ORDELL
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
they're new.

Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny" look.

ORDELL
I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
hang with Mel.

Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns around
and looks at Louis.

MELANIE
Want a Metrix?

LOUIS
What's a Metrix?

She crosses to the kitchen.

MELANIE
It's like this major meal in a shake
you drink instead of having a big
meal.

LOUIS
It's a diet thing?

MELANIE
No, it's what body builders drink to
beef up.

LOUIS
No thanks.

She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix shake.

He looks around and spots something interesting.

TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS

In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
sixteen wearing roller-disco skates.

Melanie, in a green setting, about five years ago, wearing a
pretty Oriental-style dress, with a "smile for the camera"
look on her face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie
with somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.

Louis picks up the photo frame.

LOUIS
How old were you here?

She looks and sees what he's talking about.

MELANIE
Which one?

LOUIS
The roller disco one.

MELANIE
Fourteen.

Louis walks over.

LOUIS
You're fourteen years old here?

MELANIE
Yeah.

LOUIS
I thought you were sixteen.

MELANIE
I was pretty much the same height
now as I was then.

LOUIS
Were you a disco girl?

MELANIE
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
I was only fourteen. I couldn't go
to discos.

LOUIS
So where did you go?

MELANIE
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
girl. I hated disco.

She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
till she hits Stop!

Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and looks
at the picture.

MELANIE
That was taken at a place called
"Flippers." It was in Hollywood.
Were you in L.A. back then?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
Where were you?

LOUIS
Detroit.

MELANIE
With Ordell?

LOUIS
We had done time together already.

Melanie drinks her Metrix.

MELANIE
Were you a disco guy?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
C'mon, don't lie.

LOUIS
I don't like dancing.

MELANIE
Did you ever go I one?

LOUIS
I went to a few just to meet women.
But I don't like to dance, and it's
so fuckin; loud. During that whole
scene I just drank in bars.
(he points to the cut
picture)
Who didn't make the cut?

MELANIE
That's a picture of me in Japan.

LOUIS
You been to Japan?

MELANIE
I lived there for about nine months.

LOUIS
You lived in Japan, when?

MELANIE
About five years ago.

LOUIS
Who's arm is that?

MELANIE
That's the guy I lived with... his
name was... Hirosh.

LOUIS
Must of made quite an impression.

MELANIE
I never got to know him, really. I
couldn't speak Japanese, and his
English was terrible. But I couldn't
say anything, because his English
was better than my Japanese.

LOUIS
That sounds like a problem.

MELANIE
Not really. We didn't have much to
say to each other anyway. I never
got to know him that well, but I
knew enough to know I wasn't missing
much. I keep that, because of all
the fuckin' time I was there, that's
the only picture I got of me in Japan.
(she points beyond
her shoulder)
That's Japan.

Melanie looks up at Louis.

MELANIE
Wanna fuck?

LOUIS
Sure.

FADE TO BLACK:

OVER BLACK

SUBTITLE:

"THREE MINUTES LATER"

FADE UP:

LOUIS

Lies on the couch on his back and Melanie sits on top of
him. They're going at it like a couple of fuck monkeys. Almost
on the fade up, Louis cums.

MELANIE
That was fun.

She hops off and OUT OF FRAME.

LOUIS
Yeah, that really hit the spot.

MELANIE (O.S.)
Now that's over, let's get to know
each other.

INT. MUSIC STORE – DAY

CLOSEUP a rack of CDs all beginning with "D" are flipped
through, till it stops on one CD, "The Best of the DELFONICS."

Max is standing in he soul music section o a music store. He
lifts out the CD and turns it over.

It has the song Jackie played this morning.

He smiles and takes the CD up to the register.

CLOSEUP the COCKATOO INN neon sign, unlit during the day.

INT. THE COCKATOO INN – DAY

Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the middle
of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar drinking a
white wine. Old-school soul plays on the jukebox. He sits
next to her.

ORDELL
I gotta remember this place. This is
all right. Two minutes from your
crib, ten minutes from your work.
Not bad...

A black bartender named FLOYD approaches Ordell.

FLOYD
What's your drink, brother?

ORDELL
Screwdriver.

FLOYD
(to Jackie)
How you doin'?

JACKIE
I'm fine.

FLOYD
Yes, you are.

Jackie smiles.

Floyd makes Ordell's drink.

ORDELL
I bet you come here on a Saturday
night, you need nigga repellent keep
'em off your ass.

JACKIE
I do okay.

ORDELL
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I
bet you do a damn sight better than
okay. You think anybody followed
you?

JACKIE
I don't think so, but it don't really
matter. They know I'm meeting you.

ORDELL
How the fuck they know that?

JACKIE
I told them.

Floyd comes back with Ordell's screwdriver.

FLOYD
Three twenty-five.

Ordell digs in his pocket and gives Floyd a five.

ORDELL
Keep it.

FLOYD
Thank you, sir.

Floyd leaves.

ORDELL
(to Jackie)
You told em? You told em it's me?

JACKIE
They already know it's you.

ORDELL
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta
confirm it!

JACKIE
Look, the only way I can get
permission to fly is if I agree to
help them. Which is what I have to
appear to be doing. So I give them
something they already know. You.

ORDELL
Didja tell 'em anything else?

JACKIE
I told them you got a half a million
dollars in Mexico, and you want me
to bring it here.

Ordell freaks.

ORDELL
You told them that?

JACKIE
It's true, isn't it?

ORDELL
What the fuck's that got to do with
it?

JACKIE
They know I'm delivering for you. I
mention the half-million -- they
don't give a fuck about that -- They
want you with guns. So I say, well,
if you want proof he's getting paid
for selling them, let me bring the
money in.

ORDELL
What did they say?

Jackie smiles.

JACKIE
Yes.

Ordell smiles.

They both slap palms.

CUT TO:

INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT – DAY

CLOSEUP – Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong.

Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking back,
taking bong hits.

As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;

MELANIE
...so first he tries to get into the
cocaine business but realizes right
away that shit's too competitive.
Piss the wrong person off, you get
shot. So he says, fuck that -- moves
over to guns. You can sell guns
wherever there's a demand. No one
gives a shit. He acts like he's this
big international arms dealer, when,
come on, the only people he ever
sold to were dopers.

Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across the
coffee table to Melanie.

LOUIS
He seems to be making out.

Referring to the bong.

MELANIE
Is it dead?

LOUIS
Yeah.

She starts preparing a bowl.

MELANIE
Well, so far he is. But you have to
admit he's not too bright.

LOUIS
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

Melanie still preparing her bowl.

MELANIE
He moves his lips when he reads,
what does that tell ya. Let's say
he's streetwise. I'll give 'im that.
He's still a fuckup.

She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
while holding in the smoke, says;

MELANIE
He killed a man worked for him the
other night.

LOUIS
So what are you trying to tell me? I
should get out of here?

Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her shark
smile.

MELANIE
That's not what I'm saying at all.
(pause)
You know where he went?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
He went to meet that stewardess.

LOUIS
Does that bother you?

Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.

MELANIE
Please.

LOUIS
You live with him.

MELANIE
I live here. He drops in and out. He
tell you about that half-million
dollars he's got in Mexico?

LOUIS
Uh-huh?

MELANIE
Course he did, he tells everybody
who'll listen. That's what he's doin'
with this stewardess. He's scheming
how he can get it over here.

LOUIS
And your point is?

MELANIE
Let him and that stewardess get that
money over here...

LOUIS
Uh-huh?

MELANIE
...and just take it from him.

INT. COCKATOO INN – DAY

Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.

JACKIE
...I make two deliveries. The first
one with ten thousand, like a dry
run. They watch it. See how it works.
Then we do a second delivery, when I
bring in the half mill.

ORDELL
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure.
I ain't goin anywhere near that money.

JACKIE
You don't have to. I told 'em you're
real careful. You never pick up money
yourself. You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.

ORDELL
That's a good idea.

JACKIE
If you just listen, you'll see it's
a damn good idea. The first time I
do it they're lurking about. They
see me hand the ten thousand to
someone.

ORDELL
Who?

JACKIE
I don't know. One of your friends.

ORDELL
A woman.

JACKIE
If you want.

ORDELL
Yeah, I think a woman.

JACKIE
The next trip, when I come with all
the money, it'll look like I hand it
to the same one I did before...

ORDELL
But you don't?

JACKIE
No, I give it to someone else first.

ORDELL
And they follow the wrong one thinkin'
she's bringing it to me.

JACKIE
That's the idea.

ORDELL
So we need two people, two women.

JACKIE
Can you cover that?

ORDELL
I got the woman covered. Where you
thinkin' about doin' this?

JACKIE
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
the food court.

ORDELL
I suppose you see a piece of this
for yourself?

JACKIE
Well, it's my plan. We're in this
together.

ORDELL
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
need me a partner.

JACKIE
I ain't your partner, I'm your
manager. I'm managing to get your
money out of Mexico, into America,
in your hands, and I'm managing to
do all this under the nose of the
cops. That makes me your manager,
and managers get fifteen percent.

ORDELL
Managers get ten percent.

JACKIE
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen
percent.

ORDELL
I'll give ya ten.

JACKIE
Plus the same deal as before.

ORDELL
I can do that.

They clink their glasses together.

CLOSEUP DIGITAL CLOCK

It flips to 11:00 P.M.

It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In fact,
she looks like she's coming home from a date.

She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes... takes
her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by the bed...
she sees that her answering machine is flashing. She hits
play.

We begin a SLOW ZOOM into the answering machine. Never seeing
Jackie again.

The machine voice says;

MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
You have one message. Sent at 8:06
P.M.

Max's voice comes out of the machine.

MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just
calling to find out how everything
went today with A.T.F. If you want
to call me, my home number is 555-
6788, or you can reach me at my
office, which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's
also on the card I gave you when we
first met -- I don't know if you
still have that -- but it's on it --
Oh, let me give you my beeper number.
It's 555-7839. Okay, so I'll talk to
you later. Hope everything's well.
Bye-bye.

MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
End of message.

FADE TO BLACK:

FADE UP ON:

EXT. DEL AMO MALL – DAY

We se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area.

A SUBTITLE READS:

"DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN
THE WORLD"

INT. DEL AMO MALL – FOOD COURT – DAY

The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the week.
A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's not like
it is on the weekend.

The international food court, where fast-food versions of
international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del
Amo Mall shoppers.

Jackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She drinks
an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of Broadway
shopping bags sit on the table.

We join in mid-conversation.

JACKIE
The money's in a Broadway shopping
bag. I get some food, and sit down
here in the food court. Then your
girl comes -- you got somebody yet?

ORDELL
Uh-huh.

JACKIE
Who?

ORDELL
What'd you care?

JACKIE
Look, it's my ass facin' the
penitentiary. You send some hard-
headed roc whore, and she fucks things
up.

ORDELL
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The
woman's cool, I promise.

INT. DEL AMO MALL – U.A. CINEMAS – DAY

We're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen theater
that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early seventies. A
small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema, having just
watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among them. He exits
the theater, and strolls through the mall.

BACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL

In the food court.

Ordell rises from the table.

Jackie moves a Broadway bag towards him.

JACKIE
Don't forget your bag.

He takes it.

We follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he stops...

...He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall.

Ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view. "What
the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?"

As Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food court.

MAX

walks into the food court. He stands looking a all the
international fast food choices in front of him. As he tries
to decide, he hears from behind him;

JACKIE (O.S.)
Max.

Max turns and sees Jackie siting there drinking her iced
tea, smoking her Mild Seven, and smiling up at him.

Max smiles back.

MAX
Well, hello.

JACKIE
Surprise.

He approaches her table.

MAX
I walked right past you.

JACKIE
I know, ignoring me. What're you up
to?

MAX
Catching a movie.

JACKIE
What'd ya see?

MAX
"American President"

JACKIE
How was it?

MAX
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening
are goin steady.

JACKIE
Oh, are you? Does she know that?

MAX
No...
(sitting down at the
table)
...I don't believe she's ever heard
of me. But that doesn't mean we're
not going steady.

BACK TO ORDELL

Watching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at Jackie's
table.

ORDELL
(to himself)
What's up with this shit.

BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

MAX
I think falling in live with movie
stars is something that happens to a
man as he gets older.

JACKIE
Does it happen to all men?

MAX
Well, I'd never be so bold as to
speak for all men, but as or myself
and a few of my friends, that's
definitely the case. There's a lot
of actresses out there you like, and
there's some you have crushes on.
But there's always one who you love.
And with her it's sorta like going
steady.

JACKIE
And Annette's it for you?

MAX
For now. These relationships never
last too long.

With a smile on her face;

JACKIE
That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
star.

Max smiles.

JACKIE
Who was your girl before Annette?

MAX
Sandra Bullock. You know her?

JACKIE
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
bus in "Speed." She's cute.

MAX
She's adorable. But I had to end it.

JACKIE
Why?

MAX
I'm old enough to be her father.

JACKIE
How old's Annette?

MAX
I don't care.

Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.

MAX
What're you, a bag lady?

JACKIE
I go back to work tomorrow.

MAX
You talk them into it?

JACKIE
They seem to like the idea.

MAX
Bring the money in and they follow
it?

JACKIE
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
Put the money in a shopping bag and
hand it to someone I meet here.

MAX
You don't actually do it that way?

JACKIE
He always just picked it up at my
place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
want to stage it. You know, make it
look more intriguing, like we know
what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to
follow the shopping bag.

MAX
Make the delivery somewhere in the
mall.

JACKIE
Right around here, in the food court.

MAX
Sit down, leave the bag under the
table?

Jackie nods her head "yes."

MAX
Will Ordell go for that?

JACKIE
I'm helping him bring his money into
America. He loves the idea. You just
missed him.

MAX
He was here?

JACKIE
Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
That's why all the bags.

MAX
I called you last night.

JACKIE
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted
to have dinner. He wanted to talk
about the sting we're plotting. That's
what he calls it. A sting. He's being
real nice to me.

MAX
You think he's got a thing for you?

JACKIE
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
something like he wants the money
for himself.

MAX
I don't follow your logic. What does
his being nice to you have to do
with him wanting Ordell's money?

JACKIE
He's setting me up to make a
proposition.

MAX
I see.

JACKIE
You don't propose something like
that unless you're pretty sure the
other person's into it.

MAX
Has he hinted around?

JACKIE
Not really. But I knew this narcotics
cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
the whole package never gets back to
the station. His exact words.

MAX
You know some interesting people.

JACKIE
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause
later he was suspended and forced to
retire.

MAX
Has Nicolet told you any colorful
stories like that?

She shakes her head "no."

JACKIE
He tries to act cool.

MAX
No harm in that. He's a young guy
havin' fun being a cop. I know the
type, trust me on this. He's more
interested in Ordell than the money.
If he's gonna do anything suspect,
it'll be cutting corners to get the
conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
with the money. It's evidence.

JACKIE
What about you Max?

MAX
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?

JACKIE
No, I mean you, right now. Not it
you were somebody else.

MAX
If I saw a way to walk off with a
shopping bag full of money, would I
take it?

JACKIE
You know where it came from. It's
not like it's anybody's life savings.
It wouldn't even be missed.

MAX
A half-a-million dollars will always
be missed.

JACKIE
You're avoiding the question.

MAX
Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
Especially now, since I'm getting
out of the bail bonds business.

Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
doesn't say anything.

Max continues.

MAX
I have to stand behind all my active
bonds, but I'm not writing any new
ones.

JACKIE
Why?

MAX
A lot of reasons. But the main one
would be I'm tired of it.

JACKIE
When did you decide?

MAX
It's been a long time coming. I
finally made up my mind -- I guess
it was Thursday.

FLASH ON:

A RELEASE FORM

With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
WHIP UP and see her face, just as Max Cherry approaches her,
handing her his business card.

MAX
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
bondsman.

BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

JACKIE
The day you got me out of jail?

MAX
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
guy. I hear he's staying at this
house, so I sneak in, wait for him
to come home.

JACKIE
Wait a minute. After we were together
you went and snuck into a guy's house?

MAX
Uh-huh.

FLASH ON

Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
goodbye.

MAX (V.O.)
I dropped you off...

Max finding no gun in his glove box.

MAX (V.O.)
Went to my office, found out you
took my gun...

Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
and a stun gun.

MAX (V.O.)
Got another gun and a stun gun...

BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

MAX
And went to this guy's house in El
Monte, and I waited for him.

JACKIE
What do you do when he comes home?

MAX
Shoot him with the stun gun. While
he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
'em to County.

JACKIE
You do that?

MAX
That's my job.

JACKIE
Did you do it that night?

MAX
He never came home. But I'm sitting
on the couch, in the dark, holding
my stun gun and the whole house smells
of mildew -- So after a couple hours
I think, "What am I doing here?
Nineteen years of this shit? So I
made up my mind, that's it.

JACKIE
And is that it?

MAX
More or less.

Jackie takes a pause before saying;

JACKIE
I'm not sure you answered my question.

MAX
Which one?

JACKIE
If you had a chance, unemployed now,
to walk off with a half-million
dollars, would you take it?

MAX
I believe I said I'd be tempted.

Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.

MAX
Don't even think about it. You could
get yourself killed go to prison...

CLOSEUP JACKIE

JACKIE
What if I've figured a way?

Hold for a few beats, then...

FADE TO BLACK:

TITLE CARD:

"MONEY EXCHANGE 10,000"

Over this card, we hear an airplane landing.

FADE UP:

CLOSEUP JACKIE

Back at work, standing at the exit of her plane. All the
passengers are filtering out. She says goodbye.

JACKIE
Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye... Bye
bye... Bye bye... Goodbye.

INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE – DAY

Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the LAX
parking structure, pulling her bag on wheels behind her.

Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.

NICOLET
We gotta stop meeting this way.

Jackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's Honda.

INT. JACKIE'S HONDA – DAY

The two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda.
She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the passenger
seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the flight bag in
his lap. He's taking out the manila envelope with the ten
thousand inside. Their demeanor is very different from the
first time they met. The three now almost act like friends.

DARGUS
How was your flight?

JACKIE
Fine.

DARGUS
Bet you're happy to be working again.

NICOLET
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet,
Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money
exchange trial run. It's three p.m.,
July 4th 1997. The location is the
parking structure at LAX.

JACKIE
What are you doing?

Pointing to a small mike on his lapel.

NICOLET
I'm recording this.

JACKIE
I thought you were going to let this
one through.

DARGUS
We are. Don't worry about it.

NICOLET
Every step of this goes in my report.
(back to report voice)
I am now taking a manila envelope
from the subject's flight bag.

He opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars.

NICOLET
The envelope contains currency...
all the same denomination, one-hundred-
dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.

DARGUS
What time do you have to be there?

JACKIE
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.

DARGUS
What's her name?

JACKIE
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow
her?

DARGUS
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

JACKIE
But you're not going to stop her?

Nicolet finishes counting, then hushes them up.

NICOLET
The envelope contains ten thousand
dollars. The subject will be
delivering the currency in a...

JACKIE
A Broadway shopping bag.

She holds it up.

NICOLET
A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag
with handles and brown lettering.

EXT. DEL AMO MALL – DAY

The huge Del Amo Mall.

INT. DEL AMO MALL – FOOD COURT – DAY

The Del Amo Mall on another lazy midday in the middle of the
week.

Max rides up an escalator in the mall. He casually strolls
through the mall, goes into a cappuccino bar called "BUSTA
CAP" across from the food court. Walking up to the counter;

MAX
Cafè mocha.

BUSTA CAP GIRL
You want whipped cream on that?

MAX
No, thanks.

Max checks his watch: 4:30. He looks over at the food court
and spots Jackie sitting at a table by herself.

FLASH ON:

INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Jackie on the phone with Max, dressed for bed (long t-shirt
and panties).

JACKIE
Think of it as money that shouldn't
even be here. I mean does anybody
have a right to it?

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – NIGHT

Max in his office on the phone.

MAX
The feds. It's evidence.

JACKIE
It may be evidence once they get
their hands on it, but right now
it's only money.

BACK TO MAX AT THE MALL

He ponders his words as he watches her from a distance.

INT. FOOD COURT – DAY

Jackie sits at a table by herself, eating Japanese food from
Teriyaki Donut and drinking an iced tea. As she eats she
hears;

YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Is this seat taken?

Jackie looks up and sees a skinny YOUNG GIRL, black, quite
pretty, no older than twenty.

She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway shopping
bag hanging from her arm.

JACKIE
Have a seat.

The Young Girl does.

Jackie looks at her tray of food.

JACKIE
You're hungry?

YOUNG GIRL
Yes'm.

It would seem our Young Girl's from the South.

JACKIE
Put your bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, right next to mine.

The Young Girl who hasn't looked right at Jackie since sitting
down, bends sideways to glance under the table.

JACKIE
Then when I leave, well, you know.
What's your name?

She looks up...

YOUNG GIRL
Sheronda?

...then back down at her tray.

JACKIE
Go ahead, start eating.

Sheronda starts eating, head down, hunching close to the
tray.

JACKIE
Would it bother you if I smoked?

Without raising her head, she shakes it from side to side.

Jackie takes out a pack of Davidoffs and lights one up with
her yellow Bic. As she does this she observes Sherona eating.

JACKIE
Sheronda, can I ask you a question?
Are you and Ordell married?

Without raising her head.

SHERONDA
He say we like the same thing as
married.

JACKIE
Do you live together?

Sheronda hesitates, then says without raising her head.

SHERONDA
Most of the times.

JACKIE
Not every day?

Sheronda looks up at her...

SHERONDA
Sometimes every day, for a while.

JACKIE
Then you don't see him for a few
days?

...She looks back down.

SHERONDA
Yes'm.

JACKIE
You know what's in the bag you're
taking?

SHERONDA
He say is a surprise.

JACKIE
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking
to you.

Jackie picks up Sheronda's bag and leaves.

INT. DEL AMO MALL – BUSTA CAP – DAY

Max drinking his cafè mocha sans whipped cream, watches Jackie
leave the Young Girl and with Broadway bag in hand, walk out
of the food court.

Max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in
sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B. Dalton
bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing they must be
Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them take the Broadway
bag from Jackie and look inside. They talk for a minute --
it would seem about nothing too serious. Jackie nods her
head, listens to the two cops, nods her head again, and then
walks off.

As he watches her walk away from the cops...

FLASH ON:

JACKIE AND MAX ON PHONE

JACKIE
You said it yourself. Ray wants
Ordell, he don't give a shit about
the money. Money won't convict him,
guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls
in their lap, they take it. If they
know they got it, they'll look for
it... but if they don't...

BACK TO MAX AT MALL

Max watches the two cops turn their attention to the young
girl eating in the food court.

Max watches her, too. The Young Girl continues to work her
way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head to an
OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The older woman
says something, and the younger woman hands her the ashtray
Jackie was using.

Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up from
the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway shopping bag
and walks out of the food court.

Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a little
ahead, then follow after her.

They're gone.

Max turns back on the older woman all alone.

She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,
carrying -- how about that? -- A Broadway shopping bag. The
woman heads out of the mall.

Max follows her.

The older woman walks past us. She heads straight for the
exit.

EXT. DEL AMO MALL – PARKING LOT – DAY

Max follows the woman outside.

She walks down a line of cars, then gets in a big, tan Mercury
sedan. She drives of...

...but not before Max writes down her license plate number.

FLASH ON:

MAX AND JACKIE ON PHONE

MAX
You're rationalizing.

JACKIE
That's what you do to go through
with the shit you start. You
rationalize. I can do this, Max, I
know I can. But I can't do it without
you.

INT. MAX'S CADILLAC – DAY

Max climbs into his Seville, starts her up, and drives out
of the parking lot.

CLOSEUP MAX

Driving down the street, lost in thought.

MAX
(to himself)
It could work... If she handles the
cops right, I could work...

He hits 'play' on the dash CD player. The Delfonics fill the
cab of the Caddy.

CUT TO:

BLACK

A garage door is lifted open, revealing Ordell and Louis.

EXT. STORAGE FACLITY – DAY

Ordell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A VAN
is backed up next to the opening.

The facility is pitch black. Ordell has a big flashlight in
his hand.

ORDELL
Check this out.

He turns on the flashlight.

He shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is
filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a
rocket launcher, and handguns of many types.

LOUIS
How much is there?

ORDELL
Over half-million dollars worth of
merchandise.

Ordell opens the back doors of the van. They start unloading
machine guns and boxes of ammo.

LOUIS
Can I ask you about Melanie?

ORDELL
Sure.

LOUIS
What's your relationship?

ORDELL
She one of the women I got set up. I
got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent
Simone a small house in Compton, and
about four blocks away I got me this
nineteen-year-old country girl named
Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
country as a chicken coop. Took her
to my house in Compton, told her it
was Hollywood.

LOUIS
She believed you?

ORDELL
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's
ever been, anyway.

They both laugh together.

LOUIS
Do you trust Melanie?

Ordell stops unloading.

ORDELL
If this is about you fucked Melanie,
I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.
I leave you alone with a bitch like
Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin'
that twenty minutes after I'm out
the door. So say "thank you" and
I'll tell you, "you're welcome."

LOUIS
That's not what I meant when I asked
did you trust her.

Ordell looks at him.

ORDELL
She tryin' to work your ass against
me, ain't she?

LOUIS
Yep.

ORDELL
You didn't even hafta say it. I know
the woman.

LOUIS
Well, why the fuck keep her around?

ORDELL
(smiling)
'Cause she my fine little surfer
gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact
she think she can play you against
me shows how little she knows. You
could teach that bitch for days how
it is 'tween me an you, she never
understand a damn word.

LOUIS
Why do you let someone know your
business you can't trust?

ORDELL
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.

LOUIS
What does that mean?

ORDELL
You can't trust Melanie. But you can
always trust Melanie to be Melanie.

Louis starts unloading.

LOUIS
I still don't understand why you
keep her around.

ORDELL
I told you, man.
(smiling)
She my fine little surfer gal.

EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING – DAY

EXTREME CLOSEUP – Jackie's finger presses a small black button
next to the handwritten name, "M. RALSTON."

EXTREME CLOSEUP SPEAKER BOX

MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
(coming out of it)
What?

JACKIE

Bends down to talk in the speaker.

JACKIE
It's Jackie.

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY – DAY

Jackie walks down the hallway and finds the door.

She rings the doorbell.

The door opens, she sees Melanie (for the first time) on the
other side. Melanie, dressed in a tshirt, cut offs, doesn't
say a word -- just turns around and walks away.

Once Melanie leaves, she sees Ordell standing inside the
apartment, screwdriver in hand, yelling after Melanie;

ORDELL
...Now she's gonna pout...

He turns his attention to Jackie.

ORDELL
Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.

Jackie steps inside.

She sees Louis (for the first time) sitting on the couch.

Ordell says to Louis, but loud enough for Melanie in the
other room to hear;

ORDELL
She gonna hafta find her sandals...
find her bag... find her sunglasses...
take twenty damn minutes get her ass
out the door.
(to Jackie)
Jackie -- this is Louis, Louis --
Jackie. And the chick stompin' around
in the other room is Melanie.

Melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses, sandals,
bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in her hand.
She makes a bee-line towards the door without saying nothin'
to nobody.

ORDELL
You have a nice time, hear?

The door SLAMS behind her.

ORDELL
Drink?

JACKIE
I need to talk to you alone.

EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT – BALCONY – DAY

Ordell and Jackie on the balcony.

JACKIE
I don't want no more fuckin'
surprises. We do this the way I laid
it out, or we don't do it at all.

ORDELL
What the hell you talkin' bout?

JACKIE
Sheronda passin' the money onto
someone else, that's what the hell
I'm talkin' 'bout.

ORDELL
How do you know she did that?

JACKIE
I was there, I saw her do it.

ORDELL
Well, you weren't supposed to be
there.

JACKIE
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
figured you'd try an' pull some shit
like this.

ORDELL
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
no shit. It's my money, I can do
whatever the fuck I wanna do with
it.

JACKIE
Not when it's my ass on the line you
don't. We do this my way or fuck it.

Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.

ORDELL
Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
ain't no big thing. The woman you
saw was my friend, Simone. She's the
one gonna be receiving the money, so
I just wanted her to see how it works.
She'll be here any minute. Nice woman,
you'll like her.

Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the living
room;

ORDELL
Louis, call Simone and tell her to
get her tail over here. We're waitin'
on her ass.

Louis gets up to make the call.

Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
screwdriver.

ORDELL
I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I
can't tempt you?

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT – DAY

Ordell and Jackie sit on stools around the kitchen
counter/bar. Louis sits with them on the phone, silent.

JACKIE
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the
airport and mark the bills.

ORDELL
Man, I don't like that part.

JACKIE
It washes off. I tell them we're
doing it the same way as before.
They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the
idea of leaving her for a fall.

ORDELL
She won't have no problems 'cause
she don't know nothin'.

JACKIE
Are you sure she don't know about
the money?

ORDELL
She don't know shit about the money.

JACKIE
What does she think she's gettin?

ORDELL
I told her this is a game us rich
folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a
scavenger hunt. She didn't know what
that was neither.
(to Louis)
No answer?

Louis shakes his head.

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
Hang it up, she's on her way. You
gotta listen to this. This involves
you.

Louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.

ORDELL
No, you gonna give her a
Robinson's/May bag this time?

JACKIE
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone
and I'll make the switch at
Robinson's/May. She knows what I
look like?

ORDELL
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone
goes to the dress department with
her Robinson's/May bag.

JACKIE
Designer clothes.

ORDELL
She waits for you to go in the place
where you try things on.

JACKIE
The fitting room. There's a sign
over the door.

LOUIS
Why we doin' it there?

JACKIE
I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
me. We can't risk switching bags out
in the open or even in the dining
area. That's why it has to be a woman,
'cause we do the switch in the fitting
room.

ORDELL
So you come out with her
Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.
Simone peeks out, waits for my man
Louis here to give her a signal
nobody's watchin'. She leaves the
store, gets in her car -- mission
accomplished.

JACKIE
Where you gonna be during all this?

ORDELL
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty
bar In downtown L.A. till my man
over here calls me and gives me the
O.K. sign.

Jackie's pager goes off. She looks at it.

JACKIE
I gotta go.

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT – HALLWAY – DAY

Ordell walks Jackie to the elevator.

ORDELL
Who's paging you?

JACKIE
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

ORDELL
That works on my nerves, you bein'
so buddy-buddy with him.

JACKIE
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now
once I deliver I'll have to trust
you.

ORDELL
Well, I've been trusting you all
this time, haven't I? We agreed on
ten percent of what you bring in and
that's what you gonna get.

They reach the elevator. She presses the button.

JACKIE
And a hundred thousand if I go to
jail.

ORDELL
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't
gonna screw you. You haven't told me
where I put it for you.

The elevator arrives. Jackie steps in.

JACKIE
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max
Cherry. He'll take care of it.

ORDELL
Max Cherry? You and him friends now?
You tell him about this shit?

JACKIE
He won't know where the money came
from. Only that it's money.

...the elevator shuts... As it shuts Ordell yells;

ORDELL
Don't you know all them bail bondsmen
are crooks...

...the door shuts.

CLOSEUP ORDELL

He doesn't like the last piece of new information.

EXT. THE STRAND – DAY

The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa Beach.
Jackie leaves the apartment building. She walks to her car
when she spots a funky little beach bar called, "Sally
Leroy's."

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different beer
signs, and pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, James
Dean, Ann Margaret, and surfers riding monster waves all
over the place.

The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.

BEGINNING OF SHOT

The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking into
the place and going up to the bar...

A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.

JACKIE
Do you have a phone?

WANDA
Yeah, it's in the back.

JACKIE
Thanks.

...We follow with her to the back of the bar... the MUSIC is
LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat older GUY wearing
surf clothes and sporting a mustache like a walrus. Jackie
waits for him to finish his call... As she waits, the CAMERA
MOVES BACK... until a blonde head of hair comes into the
f.g....

The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking on
a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching Jackie.
She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.

END OF SHOT

Jackie hears behind her;

MELANIE (O.S.)
Hey!

Jackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing behind
her.

JACKIE
Oh, hi.

MELANIE
Buy ya a beer?

JACKIE
I'm waiting for the phone.

MELANIE
Good luck. That guy's been in there
since I got here.

JACKIE
Well, I guess I better look for
another one, then. Thanks, anyway.

Jackie turns to leave.

MELANIE
I know what you and Ordell got goin'.
You sit down and have a beer with
me. I'll tell you a secret.

Jackie looks at her a moment.

JACKIE
Sure.

MELANIE
Great...
(calling to the
bartender)
...Wanda!

Wanda approaches.

WANDA
What?

MELANIE
This lady is thirsty.

WANDA
What do you want?

MELANIE
What's on tap?

WANDA
Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and
Killian's Red.

JACKIE
Killian's.

MELANIE
Better get me another Sam's.
(to Jackie)
Join me in a Jaeger shot?

JACKIE
Uh-uh.

MELANIE
Gimme one anyway.

WANDA
You got it.

Wanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The MUSIC
is LOUD, and they have to talk over it. Melanie moves her
head to it during the conversation.

JACKIE
How long you been with Ordell?

MELANIE
This time? Almost a year. I've known
him forever.

JACKIE
What were you two fighting about?

MELANIE
He told me to go outside.
(imitating Ordell's
voice)
"You may leave us now." It's all
part of his pathetic attempt to be
"the man." You know Mr. Walker don't
you?

Jackie nods "yes."

MELANIE
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about
Ordell.

JACKIE
That coke was yours, wasn't it?

Melanie makes a face to show pain.

MELANIE
Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about
that. I hope they don't come down on
you on my account. Ordell should'a
told you it was in your bag.

Wanda brings the drinks.

WANDA
Seven dollars.

Melanie digs in her purse for the money.

JACKIE
He said he didn't know about it.

MELANIE
(digging in her purse)
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess
you have to trust him.
(pulls out a ten)
I'd have second thoughts on that,
but then I know 'em.

Melanie takes her Jaeger shot, lets it go down, then
continues.

MELANIE
He killed a guy who works for him
the other day.

JACKIE
Beaumont Livingston?

MELANIE
You already knew that?

JACKIE
Kinda.

MELANIE
So tell me. Having all that money in
your flight bag -- Is it tempting?

Jackie nods 'yes', as she sips her beer.

MELANIE
I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me
to carry in ten thousand dollars,
that would be the last motherfuckin'
time he saw me. The next trip you're
gonna have over half-a-million. If
you thought of cutting Ordell out, I
sure as hell wouldn't blame you.

Jackie smiles.

MELANIE
You think I'm kidding?

JACKIE
Dreaming.

MELANIE
You know how easy it would be? He
won't be anywhere near that mall.
Pull one more switch, up front. That's
it. Half-a-million dollars. Need
help?

JACKIE
(smiling)
Keep it between us girls?

MELANIE
What's that fucker ever done for us?

JACKIE
(getting off the
barstool)
I don't think so, but thanks for the
beer.

Jackie leaves.

CLOSEUP MELANIE

Watches her go.

MELANIE
(softly under her
breath)
Chicken shit.

INT. STEAKHOUSE – NIGHT

Jackie and Nicolet sit at a steakhouse eating a steak dinner.
Nicolet drinks beer, Jackie drinks white wine.

JACKIE
Ordell has a white guy working for
him named Louis.

NICOLET
You two meet?

JACKIE
This afternoon before I came here.
He was with Ordell at an apartment
in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he
lives there, but I can find out.

NICOLET
You talk to him?

JACKIE
Not really.

NICOLET
His full name is Louis Gara. He just
got out from serving four years in
Susanville.

JACKIE
What for?

NICOLET
Bank robbery? Do you know what he
does for Ordell?

JACKIE
I imagine shit needs to be done.

NICOLET
We've been following Mr. Gara, and
he's definitely working for Ordell.

FLASH ON:

NICOLET AND DARGUS

In a car, parked, on surveillance.

COPS POV

Louis with the van, at the storage facility.

NICOLET (V.O.)
They served two years together almost
twenty years ago in Soledad. But he
doesn't live in Hermosa Beach.
Ordell's got him staying at a house
in...

MUG SHOT SIMONE

The older woman in the mall.

NICOLET (V.O.)
...Compton with a fifty-six-year-
old petty thief -- woman named Simone
Hawkins.

BACK TO BAR

NICOLET
Ever meet her, or they talk about
her?

JACKIE
Not yet.

NICOLET
Who's the other one?

JACKIE
White girl named Melanie Ralston.
Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

NICOLET
What's her story?

JACKIE
It was her coke I got busted with.
She knows everything, but she's not
part of it, and she's pissed cause
she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't
even let her stay at the meeting.
She tried to talk me into ripping
off Ordell.

NICOLET
And splittin' with her?

JACKIE
I'm sure that was the idea.

NICOLET
What did you say?

JACKIE
I smiled and walked away. She also
told me Ordell killed Beaumont.

NICOLET
She told you that?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
Was she there?

JACKIE
She didn't say.

NICOLET
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd
like to have a word with. So
everything's set for tomorrow?

JACKIE
Right. Everything's the same, except
one change...

INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking white
wine.

Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand, Davidoff
in the other, going over the details of tomorrow. One could
notice a slight change in Jackie.

There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After all,
she's been the architect of this half-a-million dollars
switcheroo.

She's moved heaven and earth to make all the pieces fall
into place, and all the players think what she wants them to
think.

As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
will either fail or succeed. But don't take this difference
the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is not one born
out of fear

(Jackie's nervous, but she's not afraid). It's more the edge
an athlete might feel before an all important competition.

JACKIE
I told them Ordell's changed the
amount he's bringing in.

MAX
Do you think they bought it?

JACKIE
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's
real nervous. They love thinking
he's scared of them.

MAX
You know, a good cop won't let you
know he knows you're fulla shit.

JACKIE
All he needed was a reasonable
explanation.

DISSOLVE TO:

BACK TO JACKIE WITH NICOLET

MEDIUM JACKIE

JACKIE
Right. Everything's the same except
one change. Ordell thinks it's just
too hot right now to bring in all
his money.

He knows you're watching him, and he's paranoid. He's keeping
his stash where it is, but he wants to bring in fifty thousand
for bail in case he needs it.

CUT TO:

BACK TO JACKIE AND MAX

MAX
It'll be more than that.

JACKIE
Don't be so literal. Ray believed
it.

MAX
But you still have to show him the
money at the airport.

JACKIE
Well, you know I'm not going to show
him the whole amount. He'll see fifty
thousand.

MAX
Where's the rest of it?

JACKIE
In the bag underneath.

MAX
What if he checks it?

JACKIE
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the
last time. He'll be expecting fifty
thousand and there it is -- on top.

MAX
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.

JACKIE
Not really. If he finds it, I say
Mr. Walker put the money in, and I
didn't know nothing about it. Like
the coke.

MAX
Then you're out and you get nothing.

JACKIE
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.

MAX
You're gonna have surveillance all
over you.

JACKIE
That's why you don't make a move
till I come out of the fitting room.

MAX
In a dress.

JACKIE
Well, a suit. There's one I had my
eye on.

The phone rings.

JACKIE
Excuse me.

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT – NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSEUP – Ordell on the phone

ORDELL
It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change
in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout --
everything's the same -- except for
one change. That bitch you saw in
the mall, Simone. She wasn't here
today, cause she split on me.
(pause)
Me an Louis went over to her place,
she's gone. She's gone and all her
shit's gone and so's my ten thousand
dollars.
(pause)
It ain't nothin' to worry about,
girl. Everything's just like we
discussed. Except when you do the
switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna
be Melanie.

Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat. Louis
sits at the other end of the couch.

They're watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.

ON TV

Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're pursued
by police cars.

They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at Louis,
flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare foot and
rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and gives her a
look that says:

"I'm not on your side, bitch. So knock it off."

Melanie sees this and takes her foot away.

Louis turns back to the television.

CLOSEUP MELANIE

Looks at Louis for a moment, then sighs, saying under her
breath;

MELANIE
Chicken shit.

FADE TO BLACK:

TITLE CARD:

"MONEY EXCHANGE 550,000"

FADE UP:

A GRAPHIC MAP With Mexico and California on it. On the Mexico
side we see "CABO SAN LUCAS" with a big circle around it. On
the California side we see "LAX" in a similar circle. The
tiny figure of a black AIRPLANE appears in the Cabo circle.
With appropriate SOUND EFFECTS it takes off from Cabo, flying
towards LAX, leaving a dotted line behind it. The CAMERA
moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black airplane.

CUT TO:

CLOSEUP JACKIE

Looking down...

INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM – DAY

Rearranging her bag. The five hundred thousand inside takes
up half the space. She tucks lingerie around the edges, covers
the money with blouses, shoes, and skirts and ties it all
down tight. Then places a fat envelope with fifty thousand
right on top.

INT. CABIN – AIRPLANE – DAY

Jackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle, and
is stopped by a PASSENGER.

PASSENGER
Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink
and you spend half the fuckin' flight
in the can. Soon as we land I'm making
a formal complaint.

JACKIE
Why, because I called you an asshole.

PASSENGER
You didn't call me that.

JACKIE
I didn't? Oh, well, you're an asshole.

INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE – DAY

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 3:00"

Jackie steps into the LAX parking structure, pulling her bag
on wheels behind her.

Waiting for her is Ray Nicolet.

NICOLET
We have to stop meeting like this.

They fall into step towards her car.

JACKIE
You said that the last time.

NICOLET
Well, it's true, isn't it? After
this is buttoned up we could meet
someplace else. What do you think?

JACKIE
We could, if I'm not in jail.

NICOLET
Oh, that's taken care of. I called
the State Attorney's Office. You
were no-filed this morning in Circuit
Court.

CLOSEUP JACKIE

This information stops Jackie in her tracks.

JACKIE
Are you saying I'm off the hook?

JACKIE'S POV

Nicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back at
Jackie.

NICOLET
Free as a bird. I still expect you
to finish the job, though. How much
do you have this time?

Jackie starts walking again.

JACKIE
Fifty thousand, like I said. He's
pretty sure he's gonna need it for
bail.

INT. JACKIE'S HONDA – DAY

Jackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight bag
in his lap.

He unzips it.

He sees the clothes with the envelope on top.

Jackie watches all of this.

NICOLET
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't
look like that much.

JACKIE
I was told ten thousand in each pack.

NICOLET
You didn't count it?

JACKIE
I never have. It's not my money.

He puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through the
folds of a skirt.

NICOLET
He might have slipped some coke in
here. Did you check?

Jackie, cool.

JACKIE
Mr. Walker promised he'd never do
that again.

Nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged into
the side... they touch the shoes... then move over to the
envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five rubber-banded
bond packets of loot.

JACKIE
Ever been tempted?

NICOLET
What? To put one of these in my
pocket?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
If I did, I'd have to give you one,
wouldn't I? Or we could take what we
want. No one knows how much there is
except us, right?

JACKIE
Yes. All those things are true.

NICOLET
After all, it don't belong to nobody,
right?

JACKIE
That would be one point of view.

NICOLET
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view
that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it
evidence, it belongs to us. You are
now officially out of trouble. Don't
do nothing stupid, now.

JACKIE
How can I do anything if I'm being
watched every second?

NICOLET
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me
the trouble of pointing it out to
you.
(holding up the money)
Put this in your shopping bag. It's
what I expect to find when I look in
Sheronda's. Comprende?

JACKIE
Si.

INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE – DAY

Max Cherry sits behind his desk. WINSTON POWELL, the big
black guy from the photo, is at the other desk on the phone.
Max looks at his watch.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

Max stands up, takes the sport coat from the back of his
chair, putsit on, and walks over to Winston's desk. Winston,
still on the phone, looks up.

MAX
I'm going out for a few hours.

WINSTON
(to phone)
Hold on a minute.
(to Max)
Where you going?

MAX
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie,
get something to eat.

WINSTON

ORDELL
What the fuck are you two still doing
there?!

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT – DAY

Louis stands in the empty living room, talking to Ordell on
the phone. Kate Bush plays in the b.g.

LOUIS
I was ready to leave ten minutes
ago.

Ordell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to
retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience.

ORDELL
Well, you the one in motherfuckin'
charge.

LOUIS
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'

ORDELL
Go in there, snatch her by the hair,
and drag her big ass out. This is my
goddam money we're talking about.
Get your ass out the door.

He hangs up on Louis.

Louis, pissed at being hung up on and talked to like that,
hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where it rightly
belongs -- Melanie.

Louis stomps towards the bedroom where the music's playing.

LOUIS
We're leaving now!

MELANIE (O.S.)
All right already.

MONTAGE

We see a montage of the individual characters in route to
the mall.

JACKIE

In her Honda, smoking a cigarette, looking cool as usual,
driving to the mall. Her car plays seventies soul.

MAX

In his Cadillac Seville, cruising down Hawthorne Boulevard
to the mall. He plays his Delfonics CD.

LOUIS AND MELANIE

In Melanie's Toyota drive towards the mall. Melanie drives
singing along with Kate Bush on her car stereo.

EXT. DEL AMO MALL PARKING LOT – DAY

Jackie's car pulls up to a lined parking space in the parking
lot.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME 3:52"

Jackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She goes
to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines the first
half of the bag with old paperbacks.

Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the fifty-
thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten thousand,
and puts it in her pocket. She lines the envelope with forty
thousand across the books, then fills the rest of the bag
with beach towels.

Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder, carrying
the Robinson's/May bag and with all the confidence of a world
champion prize fighter going into the ring, she strides toward
the huge mall.

INT. DEL AMO MALL – DAY

Jackie enters the mall. She looks at the people buzzing
around. Any one of them could be surveillance.

She calmly walks down the mall, then turns into the
Roinson's/May store.

INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY – DESIGNER CLOTHES – DAY

Jackie, in her Cabo Air uniform, walks up to a young Asian
saleswoman named Amy in the Robinson's/May designer clothing
area.

The saleswoman smiles when she sees Jackie.

AMY
Can I help you?

JACKIE
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
on.

Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real sharp,
badass, black suit with a white blouse.

AMY
Oh, my God. You look so cool.

Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.

JACKIE
This looks pretty good on me.

AMY
Are you kidding, it looks great. You
wear this to a business meeting,
you're the badass in the room. But
you can go out dancing in this too.
It's a total power suit.

Jackie studies her reflection.

JACKIE
I think I'm gonna just get this for
today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would
you mind ringing this up while I
change out of it?

AMY
Not a problem.

JACKIE
Thanks.

Jackie walks into the fitting room.

INT. FITTING ROOM – DAY

She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing cubicles
on her right, enters the last one.

She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag.

A full-length mirror is straight in front of her. She looks
at herself... when someone comes into the stall next to her.

Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.

MELANIE (O.S.)
Jackie?

JACKIE
Hi, Melanie.

MELANIE (O.S.)
Are you getting that black suit?

JACKIE
Yeah, do you like it?

MELANIE (O.S.)
It looks good on you.

JACKIE
Do you got something for me?

MELANIE (O.S.)
You betcha.

A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
comes sliding underneath the stall.

Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with books,
towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.

She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
and lies it on top of the bag.

As she does all this Melanie continues talking.

MELANIE
We coulda worked this. You know that,
dontcha? You would've made out a lot
better than you're going to, believe
me.

Jackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the
stall.

Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.

JACKIE
I put a little cherry on top. You're
right. What the hell he ever do for
us?

MELANIE (O.S.)
(quietly)
Thanks.

JACKIE
Now be careful with that bag. You
don't want it ripping open on you in
the middle of the store.

We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.

Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out of
her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She sticks
her uniform in the flight bag.

Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money. She
grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars.

INT. DESIGNER CLOTHES – DAY

Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales counter
where Amy waits for her.

JACKIE
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
the suit -- get out of that damn
uniform.

AMY
Oh, that's not a problem.

As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction the
CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more RAPIDLY each
go-around. They complete the transaction and as

JACKIE
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
there. Looks like beach towels.

She leaves. We follow her...

INT. DEL AMO MALL – DAY

...Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the
main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with Jackie
is completely gone.

She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction to
another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to twirl
around her. She seems to be looking for something she doesn't
see.

She looks helpless and on the verge of tears.

As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;

JACKIE
Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She
took the money.

The CAMERA stops twirling.

Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come running
out of a store towards Jackie.

As they reach her, a frantic Jackie yells;

JACKIE
Melanie burst in the dressing room
and took the money!

CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT – DEL AMO MALL – DAY

Louis and Melanie pull up to a lined parking space in
Melanie's Toyota.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 4:12"

Louis is the first out of the car.

LOUIS
Come on, goddammit, we're late!

INT. DEL AMO MALL – DAY

We STEDICAM in front of them, Louis the rapid pacesetter,
pulling Melanie behind him by the hand. Melanie carries the
Robinson's/May switch bag.

MELANIE
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.

LOUIS
We shoulda been there already and we
woulda been if it hadn't been for
your fuckin' around!

They go inside Robinson's/May...

INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY – DAY

...We STEDICAM into Robison's/May with them. We lose them
for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins, but end
up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking in a mirror
and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes floor.

AMY
...You wear this to a business
meeting, you're the badass in the
room...

We PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack,
watching Jackie.

MELANIE
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm
gonna go over and look at this Michi
Moon display.

LOUIS
Just stay right fuckin' here, all
right?

MELANIE
Are you sweating?

Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
dampness.

MELANIE
Job a little too much for you?

Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.

Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of a
natural-born smart ass to change.

MELANIE
I'll be over here. You're too
conspicuous.

Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going inside
it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards him.

He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.

LOUIS
(under his breath)
Goddammit, not till I tell ya.

He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too much,
so he starts throwing his look around when he sees something
that stops him cold.

MAX CHERRY
Max is looking at dresses, paying no
attention to the fitting room.

He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'

Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis staring
at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives Louis a wave
before turning his back to him and continues to do what he
was doing.

He quickly looks around the store to see anything else; any
more surprise guests, possible police surveillance. Everything
looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the register ringing
up Jackie's purchase. The few customers there are doing
customer stuff.

Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag and
head down a different aisle.

He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole fight
is said tense and low.

LOUIS
What are you doin'?

MELANIE
I'm getting out of here. What do you
think?

LOUIS
Lemme have the bag.

MELANIE
Fuck you. I can carry it.

She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
and pulls her around.

LOUIS
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,

MELANIE
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
fuckin' bag?

LOUIS
Gimme that bag before I knock you
out and take it.

Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only that,
this old guy looks close to buggin'.

She lets go of the bag.

MELANIE
Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
wrong with you?

He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
them.

LOUIS
I'm carrying it.

MELANIE
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
pill, for christ sake.

Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely through
gritted teeth;

LOUIS
Fuck you with your chill pill.

In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;

MELANIE
Remember where we came in?

Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.

MELANIE
(like a teacher on
Romper Room)
Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
in through Bullocks. I know where it
is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?

Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie smirk,
follows behind.

EXT. PARKING LOT – DEL AMO MALL – DAY

Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest, walks
rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.

Melanie follows close behind.

We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
direction to another aisle.

WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We see he has a searching look on
his face.

MELANIE
You have no idea where you parked,
do you?

Louis doesn't answer.

Melanie laughs.

MELANIE
Jesus, but if you two aren't the
biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in
my life... How did you ever rob a
bank? When you robbed banks, did you
have to look for your car then too?
No wonder you went to jail.

Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of his
pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But instead of
doing what he wants, he does what he should. He doesn't answer
of look back. (If he looked back and saw that Melanie-smirk,
he couldn't be responsible for what happens.) He changes
directions, cuts down another aisle and hopes for both their
sakes she shuts the fuck up.

But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.

MELANIE
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?

LOUIS
Yeah, down the end.

MELANIE
You sure?

They walk it; it's not it.

Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
next one.

MELANIE
Is it this aisle or the next one
over?

LOUIS
This one.

MELANIE
You sure?

In between two cars, Louis spins on her.

LOUIS
Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
telling you, keep your mouth shut.

Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;

LOUIS
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
word.

MELANIE
Okay, Lou-is.

That did it!

Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots her...
BAM... in the belly.

She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.

BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.

One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.

Then he hurries of for his car.

WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF HIM. He looks around, then yells out;

LOUIS
See, just where I fuckin' said it
was!

He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.

We can see Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie, and
yells through the passenger window;

LOUIS
Hey, look. I found it!

He drives away.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT – DEL AMO MALL – DAY

Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space in
the parking lot.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 4:04"

Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the Del
Amo Mall.

INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY – DAY

Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
Robinson's/May store.

He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward the
Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry counter
and begins looking at he pieces in the display case, when a
pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.

SALESGIRL
Can I show you something?

MAX
Not right now. I'm just killing time
waiting for my wife. But thanks,
anyway.

SALESGIRL
Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
don't be shy.

MAX
Thanks, I won't.

She goes off.

He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.

AMY
Oh, my God. You look so cool.

Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.

Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under his
breath;

MAX
(low)
And away we go.

Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she lifts
her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives her a nod
of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles and breaks
contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from a distance.
"This looks pretty good on me."

Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis and
Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer Clothes.

He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses on a
rack.

He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.

He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.

He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.

He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.

Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He throws
a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring dead at him
with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns the look with
a smile and a wave then turns his back on his before he can
see a reaction.

Max continues his fake browsing.

He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.

She and Louis disappear.

He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to Amy
and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting agitated
and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with cash, then
leaves stopping to say;

JACKIE
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
there. Looks like beach towels.

She's gone.

Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.

It's Max's turn.

As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance, he
says to himself;

MAX
Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
years dealing with people who take
incredible risks. You walk over to
that counter, you're gonna find out
what it's like.

Max takes a few moments...

...then walks over to Amy.

MAX
Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
left a bag of beach towels in the
fitting room?

AMY
Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
think they're in the last stall.

MAX
Thanks.

Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down the
length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.

He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is the
Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out the towels,
and sees all that money. He replaces the towels, picks up
the bag and leaves. He walks across the Designer Clothes,
passes by Amy, says;

MAX
Got 'em, thanks.

AMY
Sure thing.

Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
parking lot.

EXT. PARKING LOT – DEL AMO MALL – DAY

He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking towards
his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly, never looking
back. He gets to his car, uses opening the car door as an
excuse to look back at the mall.

It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him. He
made it. It worked.

Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with his
half-a-million bucks and drives away.

INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS – DAY

Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver and
watching a stripper strip.

BARTENDER
There a Ordell here?

ORDELL
That's me.

The bartender hands him the phone.

BARTENDER
Don't talks all day.

Ordell takes the receiver.

INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) – DAY

A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on Ordell's
tiny cellular.

LOUIS
It's Louis.

ORDELL
(now into phone)
Did you get it?

LOUIS
I got it. Listen, there's something
else I have to tell you.

ORDELL
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.
You count the money?

LOUIS
I haven't even looked at it yet,
it's still in the shopping bag.

ORDELL
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.
(pause)
Louis.

LOUIS
That's what I got to talk to you
about. You see, Melanie was giving
me a hard time --

ORDELL
Not now, pick me up.

Louis hears the phone disconnect.

EXT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUR – DAY

The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops in,
the car takes off.

INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) – DAY

Ordell in the passenger seat, bends over to the backseat,
grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his lap. He looks
like a kid at Christmas.

ORDELL
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where
they got all them car dealerships.
We're gonna leave this heap in a
parking lot and get one the cops
don't know about.
(pause)
Hey, where's Melanie?

LOUIS
That's what I gotta tell you. She
bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
carry the bag. Started running her
fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
right away when we came out where
the car was parked, so she got on me
about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-
is, is it that one?" She was totally
fuckin' with my nerves.

ORDELL
So what, you left her there.

LOUIS
I shot her.

Ordell just looks at him.

LOUIS
I expect she's dead.

Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;

ORDELL
You shot Melanie?

LOUIS
Twice. In the parking lot.

ORDELL
Couldn't talk to her?

LOUIS
You know how she is.

ORDELL
You couldn't just hit her?

LOUIS
Maybe... but at that moment... I
dunno...

ORDELL
You shot her twice?

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
So you're sure she's dead.

LOUIS
Pretty sure.

ORDELL
Where did you shoot her?

LOUIS
In the chest and stomach.

ORDELL
Well, if you had to do it, you had
to do it. What we don't want is that
bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
that woman.

Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on top
of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just looks
inside the bag for the longest time.

Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.

ORDELL
(quiet)
Louis?

LOUIS
(not looking at him)
What?

ORDELL
Where's the rest of it?

LOUIS
(looking at him)
How much it there?

ORDELL
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.

LOUIS
You said five hundred and fifty!

ORDELL
(calm)
So you light, ain't you. You light
about a half-a-million.

LOUIS
Look, that's the bag she came out
with. She never even put her hand in
it, and neither did I.

ORDELL
Came outta where?

LOUIS
The fitting room. It went down exactly
the way it was supposed to.

ORDELL
How long was she in there?

LOUIS
Maybe a minute. She came right out.

ORDELL
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?

LOUIS
Look, I swear to fucking god, she
came out with that bag and I took it
from her.

ORDELL
Then what?

LOUIS
We went to the parking lot.

ORDELL
Where you shot her.

LOUIS
That's right.

ORDELL
You sure she ain't somewhere with a
half-a-million dollars I worked my
ass off to earn?

LOUIS
(quietly)
Fuck you for asking me that.

ORDELL
Pull the car over.

Louis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth.

ORDELL
What'd you shoot her with?

LOUIS
It's in there.

Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.

LOUIS
What's that gonna tell you? If I was
really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken
two out, wouldn't I? I thought you
trusted me.

Ordell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him.

CLOSEUP ORDELL

He thinks.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP JACKIE

Holding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and saying
with a smile;

JACKIE
Gotcha, nigga.

DISSOLVE BACK TO:

CLOSEUP ORDELL

Jackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the
Beretta.

ORDELL
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.

LOUIS
If she's got it, why didn't she take
it all?

ORDELL
'fore I blow that bitch's brains
out, I'll ask her.

LOUIS
Maybe the Feds got it.

ORDELL
If there were nothin; in here but
towels, maybe she didn't get a chance
to take it from her suitcase and
A.T.F. got it. But, she put these
fuckin' books in here to trick our
ass.

LOUIS
That's why I never checked it. The
bag felt right.

ORDELL
Then she throws forty thousand in
here, to rub the shit in my face,
know what I'm saying? She wants me
to know she ripped me off.

LOUIS
I don't know. Either she has it or
the Feds.

ORDELL
Or...
(pause)
...she gave it to somebody else first,
before Melanie went in the dressing
room.

It gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers something.

LOUIS
Jesus Christ.

ORDELL
What?

LOUIS
You know who I saw in the dress
department?

ORDELL
Tell me.

LOUIS
I didn't really think anything of
it. No -- I did wonder what he was
doing there, but didn't think it had
anything to do with us. You know
like maybe he was there with his
wife or girlfriend.

ORDELL
You gonna tell me who it was?

LOUIS
Max Cherry.

Ordell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then looks
back.

ORDELL
You see Max Cherry in the dress
department. We're about to be handed
half-a-million dollars -- Man, look
at me when I'm talking to you! And
you don't think nothing of him being
there!

LOUIS
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know
each other?

ORDELL
Hell, yes, they know each other. He
bonded her out of county.

LOUIS
How am I supposed to know that?

ORDELL
You know the motherfucker's a bail
bondsman, don't ya? You know every
last one of them motherfuckers is
crooked as hell?

LOUIS
Why should I think anything's weird,
if I don't know nothin' about them
knowing each other?

ORDELL
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin'
excuses!

Louis gets mad.

LOUIS
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses,
I'm givin' you reasons.

ORDELL
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you
lost all the goddam money I got in
the world! Let me tell you the reason,
motherfucker! The reason is, your
ass ain't worth a shit no more!

Louis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells
Ordell;

LOUIS
(hard)
You best back off.

We hear a BAM.

Louis jerks.

Ordell shot him.

Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open, staring
at Ordell.

Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on Louis'
side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.

This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window. He
slumps over -- his life gone.

Ordell looks at him.

ORDELL
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.

Ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving Louis'
dead body there.

DISSOLVE TO:

MEDIUM NICOLET

NICOLET
You didn't tell me you were gonna do
some shopping.

INT. NICOLET'S OFFICE (A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS) – DAY

Jackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a chair
in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers of one
hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of coffee in he
other.

Ray stands.

JACKIE
I thought I did.

NICOLET
You didn't. I would think with all
this on your mind, you'd wait till
after.

JACKIE
I got there early. I've had my eye
on this suit -- Wait, let's start
over. I got there early. The idea
was to try on the suit, see if I
liked it. If I did, get them to wrap
it up, and change back into my
uniform. That's what Sheronda's
expecting me to wear. Go meet
Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty
thousand, and go home.

NICOLET
But you didn't do that.

JACKIE
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I
swear, Melanie came in and grabbed
it.
(pause)
And someone killed her for it.

Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment.

NICOLET
Where's the bag she gave you?

JACKIE
She didn't give me one. I told you
before, Melanie wasn't part of the
plan. Ordell must of told her to do
it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
bag, and takes off. What am I supposed
to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking
underwear. I had to get dressed before
I could do anything. So I put this
back on 'cause could put this on
faster than I could my uniform.

NICOLET
You took the time to pay the
saleswoman.

JACKIE
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't
know what to do.

NICOLET
What did you do after that?

JACKIE
I went looking for you. I went
straight to the bookstore, 'cause
that's where you were last time, but
you weren't there. How the hell else
am I supposed to let anybody know
what happened? You didn't tell me
how to do that, did you? I knew I
was under surveillance, so when I
couldn't spot anybody, I started
yelling.

NICOLET
There was a guy with Melanie?

JACKIE
Not in the fitting room.

CUT TO:

A YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT

Pretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie.

NICOLET (V.O.)
We had our agent on you. She sees a
blonde come out of the fitting room
carrying a Robinson's/May bag and
tussle with a tough-looking white
guy. The white guy takes the shopping
bag and they go.

BACK TO OFFICE

NICOLET
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis
Gara?

JACKIE
I didn't see him. I was in my
underwear. If it was a white guy, it
was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?

NICOLET
It's possible. You're saying you
don't have any idea what happened to
that fifty thousand?

JACKIE
I have no idea.

NICOLET
You'd take a polygraph on it?

JACKIE
If it'll make you happy.

NICOLET
I sure hope you haven't done anything
dumb Jackie.

Dargus comes to the doorway...

DARGUS
(to Nicolet)
Can I have a word with you?

NICOLET
Sure.

They both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the room,
smoking.

They both come back in.

Nicolet continues, Dargus takes a seat in the corner saying
nothing.

NICOLET
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found
him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've
lost Ordell.

JACKIE
I thought you were watching him.

NICOLET
We were, and we lost him. He walked
into a strip bar sometime around
three thirty and never came out. The
bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
and-a-half from where Louis was found
dead. It looks like Louis's friend
shot him twice at point blank range.

JACKIE
So what happens now?

NICOLET
We pick up Ordell. We've got three
murders we can link him to. We have
the storage unit where he keeps his
guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
warrant to go in and get him. And we
have you.

JACKIE
What about me?

NICOLET
What about you?

JACKIE
Do you think I took some of that
money?

NICOLET
I have no evidence of your taking
anything. You didn't pay for your
snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
was glad to see that. You've been
helping us out, you gave us Melanie
and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
marked bills stuffed in her shorts
when they found her, which goes a
long way backing up your story.

Jackie listens.

NICOLET
I'll settle for Ordell with the marked
bills. If you have something else
going on you haven't told me about,
it's between you and Ordell. All I
gotta say is, you better hope we
find him before he finds you.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP ORDELL

On the phone.

ORDELL
...I can't leave here today... Mr.
Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I
get my money... You wouldn't have
that fuckin' boat weren't for me.
Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my
friends are... Mr. Walker?

INT. FILTHY APARTMENT – DAY

Ordell turn to a glassy-eyed black female junkie nodding on
the couch named RAYNELLE.

The filthy apartment we're in belongs to her.

ORDELL
Can you believe that shit?
Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate
nigger. Do things for people and
that's how they treat you. Goddamn
girl, how can you live like this?

He dials another number.

RAYNELLE
(stoned)
Like what?

ORDELL
Girl, this shit is repugnant.

WINSTON (O.S.)
(on other end of phone)
Cherry Bail Bonds.

ORDELL
Let me speak to Max Cherry.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – DAY

Winston behind his desk, on the phone.

WINSTON
He ain't here right now.

ORDELL
He leave town?

WINSTON
He's around.

ORDELL
Give me his home number.

WINSTON
I'll give you his beeper.

CUT TO:

YOUNG BLACK COMEDIAN ON TV

Def Comedy Jam plays on TV, a black comedian does a nasty
stand-up routine.

INT. FILTHY APARTMENT – NIGHT

Ordell and Raynelle sit on the couch watching Def Comedy
Jam; neither one is laughing.

Raynelle's too stoned. Ordell's too tense. The phone rings,
he jumps on it

ORDELL
Hello.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – NIGHT

Max on the other end behind his desk. Winston sitting on the
edge of the desk listening.

MAX
I've been looking for you.

Ordell's up and off the couch pacing.

ORDELL
You know who this is?

MAX
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the
ten thousand you put up. Isn't that
why you called.

Ordell doesn't say anything.

MAX
The bond collateral on Beaumont
Livingston you moved over to cover
Miss Brown, remember?

ORDELL
She got off, huh?

MAX
They decided to no-file. Tell me
where you are and I'll bring you
your money.

Ordell doesn't say anything.

MAX
You still there?

ORDELL
Looky here, I know you helped her
and I know you know what I want.
Jackie can tell me any story come in
that pretty head of hers. Long as at
the end of that story, she hands
over my money. She do that, we're
still friends. Now, she don't wanna
be my friend no more, tell her to
think about ol' Louis. And if she
tries to turn me in, I'll name her
ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate
together. Hand in handcuffed hand.
Now that shit's a promise, understand
what I'm sayin'? You tell her that,
and I'll call you back.

Ordell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One of
the COMEDIANS cracks a joke.

Ordell laughs.

Max looks at Winston.

MAX
You're right, that was Ordell. You
have time, you think you could find
out for me where he's staying?

WINSTON
Cops can't locate him, huh?

MAX
They don't have your winning
personality.

WINSTON
Sure thing. I don't have to know
what I'm doing, long as you know.

MAX
I think I do. Is that good enough?

EXT. MOTEL – NIGHT

A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the
rooms.

INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT

Jackie lies on a hotel bed, wearing a long t-shirt and
panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall.

She answers the phone.

JACKIE
Hello.

INT. MAX'S OFFICE – NIGHT

Max on the phone in his office, alone.

MAX
I know where he is.

This gets her attention. She picks up the remote to the TV
set and zaps the sound.

JACKIE
How'd you find out?

MAX
All Winston had to do was ask around.
Ordell's living in Long Beach with a
woman junkie.

JACKIE
How does Winston find him if A.T.F.
and all the local Police can't?

MAX
People talk to Winston. He's street,
same as them, they trust him. They
get busted, they know somebody who
can bond them out. I thought I might
drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
surprised to see me.

JACKIE
He's liable to shoot you.

MAX
On the phone I told him I have the
ten thousand he put up for your bond.
I could bring the money and the papers
for him to sign. Walk out and call
the Sheriff's department.

Jackie gets off the bed.

JACKIE
Ray wants him.

MAX
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
him in, he's gonna name you as an
accessory.

Jackie lights up a Davidoff.

JACKIE
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't
have a case without me. If it's his
word against mine, who are they gonna
believe?

MAX
It's not that simple.

Phone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins pacing
back and forth.

JACKIE
It never was, so I'm not gonna start
worrying about it now. Look, Ray
more or less believes my story, and
he more or less doesn't care. All he
really gives a shit about is getting
Ordell.

MAX
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?

JACKIE
Get Ordell to come to your office.

MAX
Set him up.

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

MAX
Tell him you want to see him?

JACKIE
Tell him I want to give him his money.

MAX
Why?

JACKIE
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of
him. He'll like that.

MAX
What do you tell Nicolet?

JACKIE
Ordell called and wants to meet me
and I'm scared.

MAX
We get Ordell to come to my office.
Nicolet -- is he already there, or
does he come busting in while we're
chatting?

Jackie takes a drag.

JACKIE
He's already there.

MAX
What if he hears something he's not
supposed to?

JACKIE
Well, we don't let that happen, now
do we?

EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT – NIGHT

Max at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds on
the door.

Ordell throws open the door.

ORDELL
What the fuck you doin' knockin on
the door like the goddamn police?
You lookin' to get shot?

MAX
I thought you might be asleep.

ORDELL
You keep fuckin' with me, you're
gonna be asleep forever.

He looks past Max.

MAX
I'm alone.

ORDELL
Git your ass in here.

Max enters, Ordell slams the door.

As Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into his
coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max.

ORDELL
You better freeze, motherfucker!

Max freezes, his hand in his coat pocket.

MAX
You want your money? Your bond refund?

He takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills wrapped
in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who catches it
with his free hand.

ORDELL
That's all?

MAX
I have a bond receipt for you to
sign.

ORDELL
You know what the fuck I'm talkin'
about. You talk to her?

MAX
She wants to give you your money. If
she didn't, there'd be cops batter-
ramming the door right now.

ORDELL
How'd you find me?

MAX
Winston found you.

ORDELL
How the fuck did he find me?

MAX
That's what Winston does. He finds
people who don't want to be found.

ORDELL
Well, bully for that nigga. You say
she wants to give me the money, huh?

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
Well, give it to me then.

MAX
She wants to give it to you herself
and collect her ten percent. She
also wants to explain why she had to
hold on to it.

ORDELL
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around
and put your hands on your head.

Max does this, Ordell pats him down.

MAX
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
already tried to get Jackie to go in
with her, split the half million
amongst themselves. What she did was
take quite a risk to see you get
your money.

ORDELL
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?

MAX
All I did was walk out with it.

ORDELL
And you did that to protect my
interest?

MAX
In a way, yes.

ORDELL
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass.
Go sit over there on the couch.

Max does.

MAX
This place stinks.

ORDELL
You get used to it after a while.
Now tell me where my money's at.

MAX
My office.

ORDELL
And where's Jackie?

MAX
She's been there since Thursday night.

ORDELL
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she
home?

MAX
She was afraid.

ORDELL
(laughs)
That I gotta see.

MAX
She still is. She doesn't want to
get shot before she can tell you
what happened.

ORDELL
Have her bring the money here.

MAX
It's in the safe. She can't get at
it.

ORDELL
Call her, tell her the combination.

MAX
I'm telling you, you got her spooked.
She won't leave there till you have
your money and you're gone.

ORDELL
You expect me to just walk in there?

MAX
If she wanted to set you up, you'd
be in custody right now. When you
said you'd name her as an accessory
she believed you. That scares her
more than anything.

ORDELL
That's why she's givin' up my money
huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
I didn't trust her ass neither, but
I knew how to handle her. She was my
blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
fuckin' told Louis he could've just
given her a punch in the mouth, he
didn't need to shoot her. She's at
your office.

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
By herself. That big mandingo nigga
Winston ain't there, is he?

MAX
She's all alone.

ORDELL
I call your office, she better answer
the phone.

MAX
She will.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – NIGHT

Jackie on the phone with Ordell, sitting behind Max's desk.

JACKIE
I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.

She hangs up the phone. Then starts dialing again...

INT. RAY NICOLET'S APARTMENT – NIGHT

A STEDICAM glides through the apartment, it falls on a beeper
"beeping", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a dresser drawer...
it leaves that and lands on a TV screen: Tom Snyder is
interviewing a guest on his show... it leaves that and falls
on two empty and one quarter-filled beer bottles... it leaves
that and falls on a sleeping Ray Nicolet passed out in his
reclining chair.

The sound of Tom Snyder and the faint beeping are heard
offscreen.

EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT – NIGHT

They leave the apartment walking to Max's car.

ORDELL
All the time I've known her, I never
heard her sound scared like that.
Ordinarily she's too cool for school.
I'm driving, gimme the keys.

Max hands him the keys. They climb in.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – NIGHT

Jackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to her
right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer.

INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) – NIGHT

Ordell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays the
radio, he likes the song and turns it up.

BACK TO JACKIE

Sitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off the
lights. The office goes dark. No music.

BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX

The song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music
slightly. Max sits silently in the passenger seat, sneaking
a look at Ordell every once in a while.

BACK TO JACKIE

Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her
Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is
illuminated for a moment -- then it's out. She exhales a
drag. No music.

BACK TO ORDELL

CLOSEUP ORDELL

His face is ice, the music is LOUD.

BACK TO JACKIE

CLOSEUP JACKIE

She's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand. No music.

BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX

Music is LOUD. Ordell's driving. Max says;

MAX
It's the next street.

ORDELL
I know where it is.

MAX
Turn left.

ORDELL
I know where to turn.

BACK TO JACKIE

Sitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the window.
She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and sits back
in the chair. The light source cuts off.

BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX

Sitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned off
the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand.

ORDELL
My money's in that office, right?

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
She starts givin' me some bullshit
about it ain't there. It's somewhere
else and we can go get it.
(he holds up his
Beretta)
I'm shootin' you in the head right
then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
her in the kneecap, find out where
my godamn money is. I go walkin' in
there and that nigga Winston or
anybody else is in there, you're the
first man shot, understand what I'm
sayin'?

MAX
Yeah.

ORDELL
Now, is there anything you want to
tell me before we get out of this
car?

MAX
No.

ORDELL
You sure?

MAX
Yes.

ORDELL
You better be, motherfucker.

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – NIGHT

They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun in
his pants.

ORDELL
Get ahead of me and open the door.

Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
opens the door.

ORDELL
Step inside easy.

Max does.

Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.

Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.

ORDELL
Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
in the goddamn dark for?

Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the bathroom
door on the left side of the desk open, throwing light into
the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps out of the
bathroom...

Mark Dargus.

Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie. Then
Jackie says;

JACKIE
Mark...
(raising her voice)
...he's got a gun!

Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the Beretta
in his pants...

...just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three times
in the chest...

...Ordell drops to the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
lands at Max's feet.

Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look of
panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.

Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to Ordell's
body.

Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She looks
eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks over to
the body.

Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark holding
a shogun... then another... then Winston step out of the
bathroom.

DARGUS
He's dead.

Dargus looks up at Max;

DARGUS
Does he have the marked bills on
him?

MAX
In his inside coat pocket.

Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing the
forty-thousand marked dollars.

Max looks at Jackie.

She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression, just
light up another Davidoff.

Dargus looks up at Max;

DARGUS
Why were you with him?

MAX
I went to give him his refund, so he
wouldn't have to come here.

DARGUS
How'd you know where he was?

MAX
I found out.

DARGUS
And you didn't tell the Police?

MAX
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
wanted him.

Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.

JACKIE
Remember when Ray said you hoped
you'd get him before he got me?

Dargus looks up and nods his head.

JACKIE
Well, you did. Thank you.

She takes a drag on her Davidoff.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – DAY

As opposed to the last scene late at night, it's early
morning. Max sits at his desk, filling out a report.

A SUB-TITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TEN DAYS LATER"

JACKIE (O.S.)
Knock knock.

Max looks up and sees Jackie Brown, standing in the doorway.
She smiles at him.

JACKIE
Hey.

MAX FLASHES ON Jackie behind the desk.

JACKIE
Mark... he's got a gun!

Dargus shoots Ordell, Ordell drops.

BACK TO OFFICE

Max smiles back.

MAX
Hey, you.

Jackie walks toward him.

JACKIE
I got your package. It was fun getting
a half-a-million dollars in the mail.

MAX
Less ten percent.

JACKIE
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that
out, since there wasn't no note.

She sits in the chair in front of his desk.

JACKIE
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.

MAX
I hesitated taking that much.

JACKIE
You worked for it -- if you're sure
that's all you want.

MAX
I'm sure.

Pause between them.

JACKIE
I'm leaving, I have my things in my
car. Why don't you walk out with me?
I want to show you something.

Max hesitates.

JACKIE
Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.

He smiles and gets up from the desk.

As she stands, Jackie says;

JACKIE
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he
pissed he missed all the excitement.

MAX
What's he doing?

JACKIE
He's on to a new thing. He's after a
guy who owns a gun shop he says is
"woefully and wantonly" selling
assault rifles to minors. He says
he's gonna take him down if it's the
last thing he does.

MAX
Did you tell him you were leaving?

JACKIE
I told him I might.

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS – DAY

They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
convertible.

MAX
That's Ordell's.

JACKIE
They've confiscated all his other
stuff. But this one's sorta left
over. The registration's in the glove
box, the keys were under the seat...
What's a matter, haven't you ever
borrowed someone's car?

MAX
Not after they're dead.

She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks at
him across the black Mercedes.

JACKIE
I didn't use you, Max.

MAX
I didn't say you did.

JACKIE
I never lied to you.

MAX
I know.

JACKIE
We're partners.

MAX
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't
blame anybody for anything I do.

JACKIE
Do you blame yourself for helping
me?

He shakes his head 'no.'

JACKIE
I'd feel a whole lot better if you
took some more money.

MAX
(smiling)
You'll get over that.

Jackie smiles.

MAX
Where're you going?

JACKIE
Spain.

MAX
Madrid or Barcelona?

JACKIE
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?

He shakes his head 'no.'

JACKIE
I hear they don't eat dinner till
midnight.

Max doesn't say anything.

JACKIE
Wanna go?

MAX
Thanks, but you have a good time.

JACKIE
Sure I can't twist your arm?

MAX
Thank you for saying that, but no.
My business.

JACKIE
I thought you were tired of your
business?

MAX
I'm just tired in general.

JACKIE
Are you scared of me?

Max smiles and holds up two fingers, close to each other.

MAX
A little bit.

Jackie smiles back.

JACKIE
Come over here.

Max does.

They give each other a long, tender kiss.

She breaks it.

JACKIE
I'll send you a postcard, partner.

THE END

EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY (PRESENT)

A black scorpion crawls towards us on hot tarmac.  The sound of
an approaching PICKUP.  A tire crushes the life from the
scorpion, CAMERA rising from it to reveal a desolate DINER in the
middle of nowhere.

INT. DINER - DAY

MICKEY KNOX, his back turned to us, is sitting at the counter
finishing his meal. We hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine
being played OFF SCREEN.

MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

MICKEY
What kind of pies do you have?

MABEL
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

MICKEY
Which do you recommend?

MABEL
Well, the key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.

MICKEY
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.

MABEL
When ya had it, did ya like it?

MICKEY
No, but that don't mean much.  I was a completely
different person ten years ago.  Let's give key lime
a day in court.  And a large glass of milk.

Mabel turns to her right.

MABEL (to someone O.S.)
Should I make that two pieces?

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him.  Her back
is to the camera as well.

MALLORY
Nada, Rosey.

MABEL (annoyed)
My name's not Rosey. (points at name tag) It's Mabel.

Mabel exits FRAME.

MALLORY
Whatever.

Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next to
the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she
selects a quarter.

MABEL
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?

Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball.  As his eyes
follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
and a hard-hitting rockabilly TUNE cuts through the coffee shop.
(Suggestions: "Let 'er Roll" by Sid King or "Red Hot"/"The Way I
Walk" by Robert Gordon)

Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

MABEL (to Mickey)
She ought not be doing that.  That's for
Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey.  This is the first time we
see him.  As he takes a bite of green pie:

MICKEY
I can't take her anywhere.

Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
shop.  She's really cooking and smoking.

Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell
these people are.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls up
to the coffee shop, a DEAD DEER in the back.  SONNY, OTIS, and
EARL, three tough-looking rednecks, pile out.  Steam rises from
beneath the pickup's hood.

EARL
Goddamn this sonbitch is runnin' hot.  Y'all go
inside.  I'm gonna check 'er out.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps SONNY and OTIS in their
faces as they walk inside the door.  The sexy sight of MALLORY
doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

SONNY
Good God almighty.  What the hell is that?

OTIS
That's a bitch outta hell, son.

Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

OTIS
Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

Sonny heads toward Mallory.  Otis moves over to the counter next
to Mickey.

OTIS
Miller, Mabel.

MABEL
Comin' up.

Sonny stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
doing.  Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
him.

Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Otis.  Otis takes a swig,
enjoying the floor show.

OTIS (to Mickey)
That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't it?

Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Otis.  His expression
betrays nothing.

MICKEY
Her name's Mallory.

OTIS
Mallory, whatever -- who gives a shit.  I call
it pussy.

The needle lifts off the record.  The song ends.

Mallory opens her eyes and sees Sonny, grinding up against her,
grabbing for her tits.

SONNY
Hells Bells!  Don't stop now sugar.  I'm just
getting warmed up.

Sonny gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to Otis.
Otis gurgles out a laugh.

OTIS
Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

Sonny turns to Mallory.

MALLORY (sweet)
Oh, are you flirting with me?

She starts to sing "Shitlist" by L7.  Sonny doesn't understand as
she punches him hard in the face, spinning him around.  More
punches follow as she wallops him all over the diner.

A new song automatically drops on -- Patti Smith's "Rock 'n Roll
Nigger" or L7's "Shitlist" pumping the room to a new peak of
murder and insanity.

Mallory grabs the back of Sonny's head and SMASHES it down on the
table, cracking the linoleum.

MALLORY
Don't fuck with my dance! Goddamnit Mickey, why
do they fuck with my dance, goddamn is it be-
cause I'm so cute? Why are they fucking with me?

Otis jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches hold
of his shoulder.

Otis spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points his
finger at him, threateningly.

Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Otis' finger.

Otis' finger drops on his boot.  He grabs his aching hand.  Blood
flows from the wound.

MICKEY
Just because my woman's mopping up the floor
with your buddy is no reason for you to join in.

Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS.  The buck
knife slips back into its sheath.  At first, there seems to be no
difference with Otis.  Finally, blood flows from the slices made
in his face and chest.  Otis collapses.

The SHORT-ORDER COOK in a hairnet charges out of the kitchen at
Mickey, wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
his jacket and FIRES.

BULLET'S POV:  Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face.  It
HITS.  Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
the ground, screaming.

Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass window.
Earl's watched the whole shebang.

Earl mouths "Fuck!"  He turns and runs for it.

Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
SHATTERS.  The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back.  He hits the
ground dead.

Mickey turns to Mallory.  She's sitting on top of Sonny, SLAMMING
his head repeatedly on the floor. He's dead, she's still singing.

MALLORY
..."you made my ... shitlist!"

MICKEY
Honey.

Mallory looks up at Mickey.  She gets off Sonny and moves to
Mickey's side.

Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
cowboy boots.  Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
pot, crying.

MICKEY (to Mallory)
Pick one.

Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy. Twice the jingle lands on the
cowboy, but Mallory adds another phrase...

MALLORY
Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a redneck by
the toe.  If he hollers, let him go.  Eanie,
meanie, minie, moe.  My mom told me to pick the
best one ... and you are it.

...so that she ends on Mabel.  Mabel's dodging around screaming.

Mickey FIRES the .45.  The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest.  She
hits the floor dead.

Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball Cowboy
who stands in a pool of his own urine.

MALLORY
When you tell people what went on here, tell
'em Mickey and Mallory Knox was here. Say it.

COWBOY
Mickey and Mallory Knox.

MALLORY (to Mickey)
I love you Mickey.

MICKEY
I love you Mallory.

They kiss.  Holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the
cafe.

TITLE SEQUENCE

INT. CONVERTIBLE CAR - MOVING - DAY (PROCESS SHOT)

"Rock 'n Roll Nigger"/"Shitlist" blends into a PROCESS SHOT of
plates of the Southwest USA (Shiprock, buttes, mesas, Rio Grande,
Indian Reservation), mixed with the Midwest, Alaska -- the
country on the move.

The Song Track acquires a second and possibly third song, all
clashing on the track at the same time (possibly older fare like
Duane Eddy's "Rebel Rouser" or Shangri-La's "Leader of the Pack"
with some "Madame Butterfly" thrown in).  The TITLES splash over
this with big Rock Hudson/"Giant" '50's-style block lettering.

In the foreground (possibly grainy, black-and-white 16 mm,
"Breathless" style cinema verite), MICKEY drives a 70's type
American muscle car fast (Suggestions:  a Plymouth Cuda, Dodge
Challenger, Coup de Ville Cadillac).  Buffalo grass blurs by.
White clouds.

Then some RAIN.  The top is down.  They are wet and laughing.  A
bottle of tequila lays between them.  She turns the radio up
louder...and louder.  Micket drives faster ... and faster.  The
car feels like it's taking flight.  The wind, the music --
everything merges.

The CAR crashes off the road, through a barbed wire fence,
fishtails -- races on, mowing through brush.

Mickey floors it and howls to get 400 horses under control.
MALLORY yells.  Can you believe?  Can you see Life in Death?

EXT. NIGHT - STARS

A vault of Southwest Stars, clean as milk, pouring down on the
TWO LOVERS in the middle of nowhere.  Mickey peeing in the dark.
Softer Music (Cowboy Junkies' "Sweet Jane" style).

MICKEY
Goddamn!  Looks like the world's comin' to an
end, Mall.

Mallory is dancing barefoot on the hood of the car. As she
sings/talks, the stars become light-moving explosions into the
earth.

MALLORY
(dreamy, looking up)
I see angels Mickey ... comin' down for us from
heaven.  I feel their feathered wings ... I see
you ridin' a red horse, drivin' the horses,
whippin' 'em -- they're spittin', frothin' all
over the mouth -- comin' right at us...I see
the future...and there's no death
Mickey...cause you and I are angels.

She gets out of the car. Mickey, buttoning up, turns to look at
her for a moment.

MICKEY
That's goddamn poetry...damn I love you Mall.

In the shadows, we see her little devil grinning back at him, as
she pees.  Light on her flanks. She's singing "Ain't Nobody's
Business" by Billy Holiday.

TITLES END.

EXT. WINSLOW/GALLUP - DAY

MICKEY and MALLORY drive into a quiet one-street town on Rt. 666.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

The car is parked outside a cheap MOTEL in the middle of nowhere.
The sign reads "FREE HBO."

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

MALLORY is drying her hair, in a slip.

MALLORY
You wanna go out?  Get somethin' to eat?

No answer.  The TV's on to "Thelma and Louise" blasting it out
with the cops.  MICKEY has a copy of TV Guide in his hands, worn
out.

MICKEY
Nah, let's stay in, (he looks off to the
corner) we got plenty action here.

MALLORY (stepping out of the bathroom)
You know what I been thinkin' bout?

MICKEY
Course I know.  You been thinkin' bout rollin'
round that big sunflower patch outside Tulsa.

He flicks the channel.  To "Badlands" -- another shootout.

MALLORY (pleased)
How'd ya know?

MICKEY
And you been thinkin' bout cutting your hair
short.

She steps on the bed and sits on her knees, snuggles.  She puts
her head on his shoulder and he traces the line from her eyebrows
down through her nose and chin.  She's like a cat, purring,
nestling for his warmth.

MICKEY
And you been thinkin' bout us settlin' down --
on a boat in the middle of a big lake, with a
dog and a juke box.

Mallory wraps her arms around his chest, nibbles his neck. What
she never felt in her father's house -- a warmth.

MALLORY
Oh, Mick, I love it when you can read my mind.
I bet I know what you been thinkin' bout?

Mickey flicks to "Scarface" -- the chainsaw scene.

MICKEY
Yeah, why they make all these fuckin' stupid
movies. Don't they believe in kissin' anymore!
I tell ya out there in Hollywood somebody's a
taco short of a combo plate.

He gives her a big kiss.  She smiles.

MALLORY
Oh mercy.

MICKEY (laughs)
You're so cute. I love you, right down to
your... (notices)... where is it?

Her wedding ring is missing.  He glares at her hard, grabbing
her wrist.

The CAMERA suddenly hauls ass from the bedroom back through the
bathroom door and careens towards the sink.  It STOPS at a soap
dish.  There, bigger than life, is Mallory's WEDDING RING.  A
diamond to light up the sky.

Her hand comes into FRAME, grabs it and exits FRAME.

Mallory jumps back in bed with Mickey, waving her ring.

MALLORY
Calm down Mickey!  I just took it off so it
wouldn't snag when I washed my hair, goddamn.

Mickey flicks the remote to a "Game Show" -- a new refrigerator,
a miniature swimming pool, and a new car are given away in a
rapid sequence. Mickey throws her perturbed looks inbetween:

MICKEY
Even if that ring pulls out every hair on your
head, it never comes off.  If it scratches my
face, it never comes off.  If it tears out my
eyes, it never comes off.  Every great thing we
do, starts with these.

Mickey clicks their wedding rings together.  Mallory, excited,
kisses him in great slurps of lust as Mickey flicks to a "Nature
Show" -- Insects devour insects.  Who eats who, and where.

MALLORY (sexy)
If you put it that way.

She makes love to him under the sheets.

On the TV, a praying mantis swallows a bug.

Mickey, a love crazed guy, splits his looks between the TV and
something in the corner.

MICKEY (to TV)
"Jeesus, look at that...my god!"

MALLORY
Stop lookin'...will you stop lookin' at her!

It could be the TV he's looking at; we're not sure.

Mallory stops humping him, looks at her ring.  He blows some hair
out of her eyes.

Mallory, frustrated, gets off him, throws a jacket over her slip,
adjusts her highheels.

MALLORY (going out)
I'm goin' for a ride.  See ya' later.

MICKEY
Hold it? Weren't we going to do something with her?

CAMERA PANS, with Mallory on the way out to the corner of the
motel room.  A young GIRL is tied up, her mouth taped shut, her
eyes bugging out of their sockets, she's so scared.

MALLORY (going out)
Later...

MICKEY
Prude.

Mickey closes his eyes.  The TV light washing his face with
another trip to Hawaii.

EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - NIGHT

MALLORY drives, top down, through a truckstop town. It's a hot
night.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

COYOTE catch MICE drawn to the street lights. A little outside
town, MALLORY'S pulled into an all-night gas station.  Bugs fly
around the neon.  The radio in the car is on to something like
"Ted Just Admit It" from Jane's Addiction.

A YOUNG GAS ATTENDANT slides out from under a Corvette he's
working on in the garage.  He puts on his greasy cowboy hat and
walks up to her car.

MALLORY
Fill 'er up.

TIME CUT:

He pumps the gas.  She walks over to check out the Corvette.  As
he comes over,

MALLORY
Nice 'vette.

ATTENDANT (nods)
That'll be seventeen bucks lady. Say, don't I
know you?

Mallory leans into his face, a yearning.  She takes his hand,
feels it.

He looks, wondering, surprised.  There's something so needy, so
desperate in Mallory's child-like eyes.

She takes his hand and runs it up inside her shirt, muttering.

MALLORY
Why don't you just feel me...tell me you want
me...think I'm sexy?

His hands feel her up.  She presses her lips to his neck,
nibbling.

A brief flashing image of MICKEY passes before her eyes.  It's
him in front of her.

MALLORY
...come on, say it more...

His hands get rough, taking the lead.  She doesn't want that.
She pushes his head down, deflecting his agressivity.  (..."go
down")  Camera dwells on her leaning back on the Corvette as he
is he is beneath her.

But he is rough, and pops his head back up and smothers her on
the top of the hood.  His blackened hands starting to push and
knead her roughly.

ATTENDANT
Oh baby!  You are sexy!

She is increasingly agitated, coming out of her reverie.  This is
obviously not Mickey.

He spreads her hard across the hood and spreads her legs in a vee.

ATTENDANT
Holy shit!  I can't believe this...can I get ya
autograph?  You're Mallory Knox ain't yal

MALLORY
Yeah.  And you're dead.

She kicks him hard, freeing her legs.  He falls off the hood. She
gets the gun from her purse and fires an angry SHOT into him.

She is ranting as she kicks him and steps over him.

MALLORY
Next time don't be so fuckin' eager...that was
the worst fuckin' head I've ever had in my life.

She scoops the cash out of the night register at the pump.

MALLORY
Goddamn! You deserve to fucking die!

INT. GAS STATION - DAY

Peering at Mallory's underwear, JACK SCAGNETTI expresses
reverence, moving his attention to the hood of the Corvette,
dusted with crime powder.  He's a cop, one of the best.  He
consults a LOCAL COWBOY SHERIFF.

SCAGNETTI
Jesus, a perfect ass... you can even see the
crack... that's the back ... arm...her
head...fuckin' dry saliva drops still on the
fender.

He drops down to examine the DEAD ATTENDANT.

SCAGNETTI
...poor bastard was eatin' her when she did 'im.

He looks in the attendant's mouth, pulling out a small pocket
knife.  Using the tweezers, he removes a pubic hair from the dead
man's mouth. He holds it to the light, looking at it intensely.

SCAGNETTI
Mallory Knox...meet Jack Scagnetti.

INT. MICKEY CAR - (MOVING) - INDIAN RESERVATION - DAY

CU of a rear view mirror -- MALLORY'S eyes looking.

MALLORY
Fuck...fuckin' cheese!

The camera now revolves in the mirror to rack MICKEY, driving,
also peering seriously into the mirror.

MICKEY
This fuckin' guy's got me worn down to a bare
fuckin' nub.

The mirror -- A NAVAJO PATROL CAR is shadowing them.

INT. INDIAN CAR - DAY

Closer -- stoic INDIAN EYES under a tribal baseball cap.  Just
looking, tagging -- not on the radio or anything.

INT. MICKEY'S CAR - DAY

CU on a state road MAP showing Indian Reservation symbols.  Up to
MALLORY.

MALLORY
Be cool -- take the next right.  Looks like a
town out there.

MICKEY
All I see is desert.

MICKEY turns onto a dirt road off the Highway.  A cloud of dust.

They look back.

The Indian slows to a crawl, watching them...then goes past, down
the main road.

MICKEY (relieved)
That's right Cochise, go eat some more fried
bread...Gimme some more mushrooms.

Mallory reaches for the mushrooms -- gives him a couple of dry
chewy puips.  He gnashes on them.  The radio's been playing
something zonal like "Alive" by Pearl Jam or "Dizz Knee Land" by
Dada.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - LATER - DAY

They have run out of gas in the middle of nowhere.  Red earth.
Sky.  Clouds.  A thrush calls out a song.

MICKEY is staggering, besotted with mushroom power.  Sticks his
gun in his belt, begins walking up the road looking for gas.

MICKEY
Shit. Right now I'd go down on a lawman for a
gallon of gas...do I have something on my nose?

MALLORY (sings it)
"Guess it's farther than I thought."

MICKEY
Snakes, birds, nothin' out here. "Turn right?"
Turn right to what? You fuckin' stupid bitch.

She punches him right in the face.  Then she kicks him to the
ground.  On the ground he tries a savate kick. She sees it
coming, jumps over him and lands right on him, gun in his
forehead.

MALLORY (mocking)
"You stupid bitch!  You stupid bitch!  You stupid
bitch!!" Don't call me bitch.  My father called me that.
Once too much.  You're losing it, Mickey.

He has a tooth loosened.

MICKEY
Sure Mall, take it easy...it's me, your lover,
not some demon.

MALLORY
How do I know that? Take off your pants and
gimme your money...now.  I'm serious.

MICKEY
Mall! I don't have to be dictated to by a woman...

MALLORY
Shoes too.

She fires. Into the ground. Right next to him. He hops to comply.

MICKEY
What are you gonna do?  Leave me. Just cause I
don't have the goddamn same puritanical belief
systems you do!  What the fuck is that gonna...

She fires again.  Speed it up.  He senses she's really pissed.

MALLORY
Mickey, you gotta get respect for me...turn
around and drop your knickers.  I want to see
your ass up in the air.

MICKEY
Mall!  What the hell game is this!

She fires again. The shots bring the sound of BELLS jingling.
They look.

On a KNOLL fifty feet away stands a flock of RAMS.

Conversely, the Rams' POV is of a near-naked man and a woman with
a gun in the desert. The Chief RAM tears out after Mickey.

MICKEY
What the fuck!

He starts to run.

MICKEY
Shoot it!  Goddamn Mall, shoot the fucker!!

Mallory laughs as the ram closes on Mickey.  But the Ram comes to
an abrupt stop as it hears the WHISTLE.

A FIGURE now stands at the top of the knoll with the flock of
sheep and a YOUNG BOY.  The ram trots back towards him.

Mickey looking.  Mallory puts away the gun.

The Figure is an OLD INDIAN.

Mickey crossing himself, half joking.

MICKEY
Rejoice...for he hath found his sheep which
were lost in the desert
(pointing)
Hey, Chief, we ran outta gas...our car's up the
road apiece.

The Indian knows something. He says nothing, continuing down the
hill and across the road with the Young Boy, the ram and about 30
sheep.

Mickey, throwing on his clothes, follows with Mallory, their
dispute forgotten for now.

EXT. DESERT HOGAN - DAY

MICKEY AND MALLORY approach a hogan -- a mud and log structure,
twenty feet across.  A PICKUP is parked nearby.  A scruffy DOG
alongside a PICKUP barks as they approach; a DONKEY is tied to a
pinon tree and SHEEP wander.

The YOUNG BOY stands in the breeze watching them.

Mickey knocks at the open door.

MICKEY
Hi...so look we got tobacco, lots of tobacco...
you got any gasoline we can buy?

No answer.

MICKEY (looking at the donkeys, to Mallory)
We can always snatch the donkey and ride outta
here.

MALLORY
Maybe he don't speak English.

INDIAN
Come on in.

Mallory and Mickey look at each other and step inside.

INDIAN (his only English)
Come on in.

INT. HOGAN - DAY

It's dim inside but cozy.  The old INDIAN sits on a rickety old
bed with a horsehair mattress, sheep skins and an Indian blanket.
A worn aluminum kitchen table occupies the middle of the room.

Bays of dried ears of corn, squash, melon and beans lay on the
dirt floor.  Chilies and dry mutton hang on wire strung on one
side of the room.  A pile of cedar wood is stacked by an old
franklin stove, a covered pot on top.  Scraps of cotton hang over
the windows, various photos of family and friends, and feathered
Indian gear hang from nails pounded into the wall.  It's very
quiet.

INDIAN
Come on in.

He motions for them to sit in an overstuffed chair.

MALLORY
Thank you (pointing to herself)  I'm Mall-o -
ry...That's Mi...ckey.

Everyone nods and smiles.  MICKEY and MALLORY show another side
of sweetness and politeness.  The YOUNG KID coming in and sitting
down next to the OLD MAN.

INDIAN (in navajo)
When are you leaving?

Mallory signals they don't understand.

INDIAN (in navajo to the Boy)
Good looking woman...uh...Man's got things in
his head he can't get out...demons.  Too much
TV...Trouble follows that one.

MICKEY (to Mallory)
This is like the twilight zone or something.

The Old Man walks over to some pictures on the walls, hands one
to Mallory of a YOUNG COUPLE back in the 1940s or 50s.


[PAGE 17 MISSING]


INDIAN BOY (navajo)
Can you help them grandpa?

INDIAN (navajo)
Maybe they don't want to be helped.  They both
fly too close to sun.  Now they are falling to
earth.  That is why they have come here.  My
prayers would mean nothing in their world.

He stokes the fire, feeds the snake again. He studies a crystal
in his hand.

INDIAN (navajo)
Once there was a woman who went out to collect firewood.

The snake is crawling over to the Indian who reaches down and
picks it up and puts in his lap.

INDIAN (navajo)
You want to hear the story too don't you old
man... O.K. (continues)  She came upon a
poisonous snake frozen in the snow.  She took
the snake home with her.  She put the frozen
snake on her favorite blanket by the warm fire.
She fed it and nursed it back to health.  One
day she picked the snake up and it bit her on
the cheek.  As she lay dying she asked the
snake, I loved you, why have you done this to
me?  The snake answered, "look bitch, you knew
I was a snake."

He chuckles, as does the Boy. It's very quiet. The sound of the
fire.

Mickey has fallen asleep.  The Old Indian begins to SING.

Mallory is awake, watching the Indian.  The room, shadows
dancing.  It is the first time she can remember feeling peace,
almost like family.  She starts to drift off.

Mickey is dreaming out loud.

The Old Man stands and takes the snake to the door.  Opening it,
he lets the snake out.

INDIAN (navajo)
Go be a snake.

Mickey's nightmare is getting heavier.  He's moaning and sweating.
The Old Indian takes his feathered hat of f the wall and puts it
on.  He opens a wooden box and takes out a white eagle feather
and a bundle of medicine.

EXT. HOGAN - NIGHT

The OLD MAN and the BOY with him now make offerings to the four
directions, to the grandfather spirit, the stars, the earth, the
mother, praying, singing.  His face and hands are marked with
white ash and colors so the spirits will recognize him.

INT. HOGAN - NIGHT

As we hear the mounting sounds of the prayer, we see MICKEY'S
face dreaming, sweating.

The OLD MAN is now leaning over Mickey and MALLORY in half light,
shaking the rattle and waving the burning sage over Mickey to
chase the demons.

We push into Mickey's eyes.

DREAM IMAGERY -- death, murder, shit...a WAR FOOTAGE.  In
Bosnia...a decapitated BODY sitting in the corner of the room,
just sitting as if alive, as if about to rise up...A MAN slaps a
WOMAN. A BABY cries...shooting...a MURDER VICTIM screaming "Oh
god no! Please no!" BIRDS fly backwards...A MONSTER with a knife
in its hand coming at us, the face of the Demon!

Suddenly TWO SHOTS explode off the walls of the hogan.

Mickey is awake, stunned, sweating -- the gun in his hand.

Mallory sitting up.

The OLD INDIAN stands still over Mickey.  Everything stops.

Then staring into the Beyond, he falls to the ground.

Mickey is shocked, howls.

MICKEY
Ahhhhhhhhh!

MALLORY (screaming, feeling the merge)
Ooohhh my God... Mickey YOU KILLED HIM!!!

They look down at the dying Chief.

INDIAN (quietly, in navajo)
You thought coming here was an accident...this
was no accident...I saw this demon in my dream -
- 20 years ago.  I was waiting...I forgive you.

The Old Indian dies.

MALLORY
This is bad Mickey.

Mickey walks outside, in circles, ranting to himself.

EXT. HOGAN - NIGHT

The last of the moon is disappearing behind the earth.  The lone
dog howls.

MICKEY with the gun in hand runs to the Indian's PICKUP truck,
jumps in.  It won't start. He catches a glimpse of something in
the rear view mirror.  The DEMON FACE over his own.

MICKEY (spooked)
SHIT!

He leaps, scrambles out of the truck, looks in the back for gas.
A 5 gallon can.  He shakes it.  Half full of gas.

MICKEY
Mallory!

INT. HOGAN - NIGHT

MALLORY is covering the dead INDIAN with his blanket.

MICKEY (O.S, desperate)
Mallory!

EXT. HOGAN - NIGHT

On the horizon, we see the YOUNG BOY standing there looking.  He
runs away.

MALLORY walks past MICKEY, heading elsewhere.

MICKEY (carrying the can)
We got gas, baby.

She says nothing, pissed.

MICKEY
Come on Mall -- it was an accident.  This whole fucking
thing is crazy (catches up to her, spins her).

MALLORY
Don't you feel anything!...Something else has
taken over Mickey. I don't know what's real
anymore. I'm scared. That was bad! Maybe we were
led into the wilderness by the demon.


MICKEY
There's no demon -- just us.

She looks at him.

MICKEY
I'm sorry bout the old man.  I really am.  But
you gotta be strong Mall.  I need ya.  Now come
on.  The car's this way.

Mallory walks away.

MALLORY
I felt at peace last night. It's over Mickey!
I'm going any place but with you.  You got no
real feelings. You're just as dead as all of 'em!

Mickey follows.  A sudden rattle in the night.

MICKEY
Wait a minute!

Mickey flicks a lighter.

A big RATTLESNAKE.

They walk around it.  She wants to get away from him, doesn't pay
attention.

He flicks his lighter again.

MORE SNAKES.

Mallory keeps walking faster and faster.  Mickey tries to grab
her.  She breaks away.

MALLORY
Lemme alone!  I'm outta here.

We hear another RATTLER.  Mallory screams out.  She's bit!

MICKEY
OH GOD NO!

He starts shooting into the ground.

Mallory lies there stunned, hands to her ears.

MALLORY
Stop it...STOP IT.

Mickey rips off his shirt and wraps it around a stick, soaks it
in the gasoline and lights it, making a big torch in the night.

There are SNAKES coming at them from all directions.

MICKEY
Holy Shit!  What the fuck have we done!

Lighting the way with his torch, he hauls Mallory up and hotfoots
it out of there, snakes popping their rattlers everywhere.

A huge RATTLER sinks its fangs into Mickey's leg.  They're both
bit.  He keeps moving, spitting the torch into the snake's face.

INT. CAR - MOVING - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Mickey driving past a ROADSIGN saying "GALLUP."

MALLORY is delirious.

MICKEY
You'll make it Mall.  Badasses don't die ...
Indians got a saying I read.  It says you're
either stronger than the poison or you die.  They
get bit, they run... fast as they can.  They
either drop dead right then and there...or they
live.  We're gonna live Mall -- a long, long time.

PAST A CHEAP MOTEL on the outskirts of town -- says "U SLEEP
MOTEL. $7.50 the night.  Free Hot Tubs.  Porno Films on Cable."
The CAMERA stays with the motel, letting the car whip past.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

JACK SCAGNETTI, in undershorts on the bed, is drunk, sweating,
eyeballing a friendly YOUNG WOMAN.  She's awkward, a little
nervous but she's down to her undergarments, looking at the
CLIPPINGS of "Mickey and Mallory" spread over the table and
dresser, pictures of crime scenes and his book -- "Scagnetti on
Scagnetti."  A half empty bottle of vodka.  A gun, handcuffs and
a police badge.

PINKY (worried)
...my name's Pinky...
(no answer)
Say are you a real cop?  Or are you some kinda
freak or something?  I don't want no trouble.

SCAGNETTI (mumbles)
Ya...I'm a real cop.

Pinky smiles.  The light from the TV fills the room with a
strange aura.  The sound is off.  We hear MUSIC from the next
room.  TRUCKS pass by outside.

PINKY
You're not qonna hurt me are you?

SCAGUETTI
I never hurt anybody in my whole life. I'm the
law.  I'm your protector. You don't ask me any
more questions, Pinky...step up on the
bed...move slowly.

Not sure what he wants, Pinky steps barefoot up onto the bed,
standing over him, a foot on either side of his torso...she's
slowly bending, spreading, arching like a young woman remembering
childhood ballet dreams, her eyes closed...

He moves his hands up her legs and ass, exploring, continuing up
across her shoulders.  Around her neck, bringing her down. Closer.

SCAGNETTI
Come here, give big Jack a kiss...just keep
lookin' at me now...just keep lookin'...don't
close your eyes...y'ever been strangled?

Head LIGHTS wipe across the wall.  A TRAIN passes.

A different rhythm now.  Her eyes.  His hands around her neck.
Strangling her.  She is terrified, struggles.

An ankle with a thin gold chain.  A flailing arm kicks over the
night stand and lamp.

Falling, rolling.  Stale green motel carpet...she heaves,
staring.  Slender leg kicking, fists pound at his face as he gets
on top of her.  Fingers tear flesh.  Not a word is spoken. Her
eyes never close. Fingers tear at his cheeks.

The TRAIN has passed.  Silence.  The TV blinks.  The radio plays
softly in the next room (people partying, laughing).

His face.

EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - EDGE OF TOWN - NIGHT

The HOOKER'S separated body vanishes in plastic bags in a large
dumpster.

SCAGNETTI looks around, impeccable in a clean suit, shiny
cufflinks.  He crosses back to his car, revealing an ancient
DRIVE-IN next door.

EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE - NIGHT

The last show.  A Goldie Hawn-Steve Martin picture is playing --
giant closeups, a comedy.

MICKEY and MALLORY are slumped against the driving wheel,
delirious, struggling for breath, sweating heavily.

MICKEY
When's this over?  We gotta get outta here,
Mall...we...

MALLORY
Angels Mickey... I see angels

On Goldie Hawn. (ANIMATION SEQUENCE begins here -- TBD)

MICKEY
Ya, I see em.

MALLORY
They're guarding us.  Each step we're
together...Oh God...it's perfect.  We're gonna
make it Mickey...we're gonna...

MICKEY
Goddamn Mall, that's poetry.

Mickey slams the car into drive, plowing forward out of the
parking spot, smashing the movie meter.

He sideswipes into another car, screams, anger. A PERSON stepping
out to confront.

Mickey slams his car backwards into the angry person, crushing
him.  Then he zigzags his way through the parking lot past the
faces of Goldie and Steve.

EXT./INT. "DRUG ZONE" - NIGHT

It towers over the deadbeat western landscape like a vision of
the future -- gleaming white cube of fluorescent power -- sacred
Aztec Gods within -- offering aisle after aisle of nicely colored
packages of American D...R..U...G...S.

HIGH ANGLE moving on MICKEY staggering down one aisle ... looking
(presumably) for snake venom.

The same goes for MALLORY in her aisle -- face now green with the
sickness, cotton-mouthed. Time is running out...her breathing
labored, short -- a sound from hell.

MALLORY (pleading)
Mickey, I'm so cold...I'm goin' now...

Staggering, falling in the aisle...

MICKEY
No you're not! No you're not! Get angry!  Mall--

Mickey in his aisle looking through the rubbers, pulling out a
handful, staggering down a football-field aisle towards the
counter that looks as far as an oasis in the Mojave.

ON TV:

At the CONTTROL BOOTH,  a nine-inch COLOR TELEVISION plays in
CLOSE UP.  A pumped up MUSIC CUE peaks as we see:

TITLE:  PRODUCED AND DIRECTED BY WAYNE GALE

Following a series of shots of WAYNE GALE in the field (VIDEO
SEQUENCE), the young commando journalist stands on the yellow
line of Highway 58. His accent AUSTRALIAN STREET:

WAYNE TV
Welcome to another episode of "American
Maniacs," where we chronicle the mayhem, the
brutality, and the violence of that peculiarly
American creation -- the serial killer.

PULL BACK to reveal an enormous POLYNESIAN DRUGGIST, 300
pounds, watching a portable TV on the counter of the control
booth.  He's behind a hi-strength glass and raised up a couple of
steps.  His eyes, at this late hour, nervously wander to his
SURVEILLANCE SCREEN -- revealing:

ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR:

Mickey and Mallory, separate aisles, alone in an enormous sea of
fluorescence, foaming.

ON THE TV:

WAYNE TV
Tonight I'm standing on Highway 666 -- running
through towns like Cortez, Colorado, Shiprock,
and ending in Gallup, New Mexico.  To some it's
a beautiful stretch of the American landscape,
but to Mickey and Mallory Knox, who are still
at large, it is literally a candy lane of
murder and mayhem...

The moments are expanding in the Pharmacist's eyes as -- not
yet, but almost -- thoughts begin to cross over into neighboring
compartments.

HOME MOVIE MONTAGE -- TV

On the TV -- a MONTAGE OF Home Videos.  These are films of Mickey
and Mallory living a normal life.

-- MALLORY -- very introverted -- with her PARENTS who look
really weird -- doing something weird like feeding the fish.  Or
all three are smiling, Mallory in the middle.  Her father holds a
chicken drumstick.  Mallory's taking a bite out of it.

-- MICKEY in his high school yearbook photograph or elementary
school.  Very innocent, sweet.  Possibly a photo in Santa's lap.

WAYNE TV
Once they were average citizens, living drab,
nothing-ever-happens lives, but then these
sweethearts began a cross-country murder spree
that has lasted only three terrifying weeks but
has left.

-- PHOTOS: BLACK & WHITE of bloody VICTIMS -- both men and women

-- PHOTO:  BLACK & WHITE of a bloodstained police chalk outline.

WAYNE TV
...forty eight known bodies in its wake.
Including...

TIGHT over the DRUGGIST in enormous diopter as MICKEY approaches
the CONTROL BOOTH, staggering.

A PHOTO OF MALLORY'S PARENTS -- MOM and POP.

WAYNE TV
Mr. and Mrs. Ed Wilson -- who are -- or rather
"were" -- Mallory's Mom and Dad!

The Pharmacist's terrified eyes carry from the television to
Mickey trying to get his attention out the booth.  Up close
Mickey looks like shit, pale, sweating, waving a handful of
rubbers at the Druggist.  His mouth voicing words through the
ventilated "bullet-proof" glass:

MICKEY
Hey you... 'scuse me?  Aloha?

The Pharmacist in zombied terror approaches.

MICKEY
Hey!  Chief -- this rattlesnake took a chunk
out of us a ways back. My lady friend and I are
pretty sick...I think we're dyin', but you
never can tell these things... so how's 'bout
ungluing your fat ass from the boob tube and
getting us some snakebite juice, okay??

The Pharmacist nods and silently pushes the ELECTRONIC ALARM
beneath the counter with his fat finger.  In a daze of his own,
he complies with Mickey's request, meandering to the medicine
shelves.

ON THE TV:

WAYNE in front of a 7/11 store.

WAYNE TV
Mickey and Mallory started off as armed
robbers, but their idea of robbery is a little
different than you or I -- in fact it is an
assault.

ON TV CONT.

INT. 7/11 STORE - DAY

This scene is shot through the store's black and white
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA high angle corner.

MICKEY and MALLORY are in the 7/11, cocking their shotguns and
shouting things.

MICKEY (on video)
Money! Money!  Money!  Fast!  Fast!  Faster!
Faster!

MALLORY
Mickey!

Mickey shoots a CUSTOMER.

Mallory blasts the Young CLERK who flies into a comic book rack.

MICKEY (not noticing the TV, impatient)
You fuckin' find it yet?

The Pharmacist, stalling, fiddling with bottles, ultranervous
about the naked TV staring at Mickey, trying to distract him.

PHARMACIST
Have...have you tried the hos... hospit...tal
yet.

MICKEY
What the hell is this?
(sicker)
You fuckin' find it yet!

WAYNE TV
They'd storm in with shotguns and kill every
customer in the place without hesitation.  But
they always leave one clerk alive.  To tell the
tale of...

ON TV --

The surveillance camera revealing Mickey and Mallory tearing out
the 7/11 leaving one OLD INDIAN behind.

CUTTING to PHOTOS, BLACK and WHITE, of:

MICKEY and MALLORY -- high school sweetheart photos

Staring right back at him.  It finally reaches MICKEY who can't
help but be flattered.

WAYNE TV
Mickey and Mallory!

MICKEY
I'll be damned. (then) You piece of shit!

He goes for his gun.

The Pharmacist, all 300 pounds of him, hits the floor in one
giant sumo fireball.

Mickey blasting the window with his gun -- bullets careening off
the hi-strength glass.

MICKEY (come alive)
MALL!!!  COPS!  Get the fucking car out front!
I'll get the snakeshit!

Mallory, reinvigorated by the mention of "cops!" -- gets back to
her feet and with pure, groggy will tears herself outside like a
cyborg.

Mickey with successive gunblasts, shatters the COUNTER GLASS and
climbs in...

The Pharmacist, hands hitting the ceiling, begs for his life.

PHARMACIST
Ppppppplllll.....eeeezzzee.

MICKEY
Snake juice!

The Pharmacist shits --

PHARMACIST
We don't carry...hosppp...ital... I'm the only
clerk left...I'm the onnnnlllly clerk left ...

Mickey trashing the counter in any case, cramming every
prescription drug into a shopping bag, comes close.

MICKEY
Yeah, but you forgot one thing...

PHARMACIST
Whhhaaaat's th...thhhaaaat?

MICKEY
If I don't kill you, there's nothing to talk
about, is there?

The Pharmacist gets it.

MICKEY
Fuckin' squid!

Blows his 300 pounds through the gut.  Octopus flesh flying in
gobs in every direction.  Mickey tears out of there...

FLYING POV CAMERA -- ripping down the aisle, Mickey's POV --
there's a honk from outside.

Mickey tearing past vitamin displays, knocking down a rack of
stuffed animals.  His strength is fading.  Snake juice coursing
through his veins.

FLASH -- THE DEAD INDIAN

FLASH -- THE SUN.  BUDDHA...some sign of spiritual hope.

He gets to the door, swings out through the glass.  Sees it:

EXT. PHARMACY AND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Mallory is slugging it out toe to toe with a COP.  Another COP
lies on the ground at her feet, dead.  TWO COP CARS.

THREE MORE COPS in windbreakers are tearing up - simultaneously
spot MICKEY in the doorway.  They hit the pavement pulling their
guns.

Mickey is faster.  Whipping down, his .45 out, blazing away...

Tearing a hole through one COP...

Taking out ANOTHER with a headwound.

Bullets CRASHING through the pharmacy glass, shattering the
frontage of the store.

INT./EXT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

MICKEY scrambling back into the aisle, protected.  Looks back and
sees:

COP (O.S.)
Throw your gun down!  And get on the floor!
Now!

AN EXIT PATH -- out the rear of the store.

But back to MALLORY as she is engulfed by TWO MORE COPS,
altogether beating the shit out of her with guns, fists,
nightsticks, and dragging her behind one of their cars.

The look on Mickey's face.  Heartbroken.  He's gotta stay.  He's
gotta go down with her.

MICKEY
Awright!  Awright!  I'm coming!! But don't
fucking touch her!  You hear me or you got a
few more dead pigs on your hands!

COPS, crouched behind protection, looking at each other.

MALLORY (yells)
Mickey!  Take off!

COP (O.S. to Mickey)
Okay! Okay! She's secured!

Their POV -- Mickey's TWO GUNS come skittering out from behind
the aisle.

Mallory, blood pouring out of her, looks, moved by his action --

MICKEY
(standing, arms in the air, full exposure)
So...come'n get the big bad wolf.

SCAGNETTI suddenly appears from behind one of the cars -- nice
suit, a gun in his hand, the "look." Even down to the fingernail
scars on his cheek.

A LIGHT pops on.  A LOCAL NEWSCREW filming as:

Three more COP CARS arrive.  POLICE are pouring in.

SCAGNETTI
(on bull horn)
Put your hands where I can see them.  Step out
into the light and lay down on the ground.
Now...

With Scagnetti in the lead, the video camera tracks behind the
THREE COPS in windbreakers crashing towards Mickey, guns drawn,
overdoing it a bit for camera in a "COPS" TV docudrama style.  A
"recreation" already of an event that is just traspiring.

Mickey has a smile on his face as Scagnetti hauls him around and
cranks up his arms behind his back, trying to cuff him.

SCAGNETTI
You're outta business Knox you fuckhead!
You're gonna die, you piece of shit!

Mickey, never out of surprises, joker smile and all, wrenches one
hand free.  He whips out his BUCK KNIFE and swings it behind him.

He hits COP 1 in the eyes.  COP 1 screams and falls on the
ground.  Blood smears his face and hands.

COP 1
My eyes!  My fuckin' eyes are out!

Scagnetti has jumped back, alarmed.

SCAGNETTI
Don't kill him! I wanna fuck him! He's mine!

Mickey stands there, knife in hand, toying with them.  As he
drops the knife:

The TWO OTHER cops pull out their TASER GUNS and fire lots of
volts into Mickey's torso.  It's an extraordinary sight!

CU on Mickey on fire, electrified, spinning, spinning...till he
sees stars, millions of stars.

The CAMERA WHIRLING with Mickey as he crashes to earth.

Unsatisfied, the Cops pull out their clubs and beat him
mercilessly -- with all the pent-up righteous rage of so many
good men killed in the line of duty against this raging
psychopath asshole.  Galaxy bandit.  Forever outlaw to the race
of man.

The NEWS CREW films.  In the wake of Rodney King, the Cops don't
really pay attention.

Mallory, bloodied to her pulp, watches from the ground, on her
knees, arms squeeze-cuffed behind her, a nightstick through her
elbows.  She SINGS to herself.

Scagnetti crosses to her, jerks her up by the hair, examines her
as coldly as a bug.

MALLORY (sings, ignoring him)
"These boots are made for walkin
That's just what they're gonna do
One of these days these boots are gonna
walk over you"

She doesn't bother to look at him.

FADE TO BLACK:

ACT TWO

EXT. BATONGA PRISON - DAY

SUBTITLE:  "A YEAR LATER"

TWO MEN move toward us -- SCAGNETTI and a Deputy Warden,
WURLITZER, in uniform.

WURLITZER
...always wanted to meet you Scagnetti.  I
respect you and you know what, I even bought
your book and I read the whole goddamn thing!

As they walk past us, revealing the medieval-looking prison in
background, they come to a standing tower of a man, Warden
DWIGHT McCLUSKY -- suit and tie, a man of iron from another era
-- with another Deputy Warden, KAVANAUGH, in uniform.

WURLITZER (introducing)
Warden...Jack Scagnetti.

McClusky giving him an iron handshake.

MCCLUSKY
...Dwight McClusky.  Welcome to Hell.

Scagnetti playing top dog, supercop cool.

SCAGNETTI
Good to meet ya Dwight.  How the hell are my
two favorite assholes?

MCCLUSKY
We got the two rat fucks back in there.  I
guess you wanna see  em.

INT. PRISON CORRIDORS - DAY

A door slams, giant reverb down the halls.  Echoes of keys
clinking, eyes of GUARDS.  McClusky waves his arms as he moves
and gates slide.

As they move, we sense a tense prison -- the nervous demeanors
and eyes of GUARDS, silent scary PRISONERS in close proximity.
The TWO DEPUTIES, Wurlitzer and Kavanaugh, tag along, wary
protection, despising the inmates, ADLIBBING to their many
requests.

MCCLUSKY
I seen you on TV.  I even went and read your
goddamn book.  I'm impressed.  That E. Scarwin
case was something.  You put an end to a
nightmare, Scagnetti...

SCAGNETTI
It was no big deal, Warden, just business as usual.

MCCLUSKY
I'm surprised Hollywood ain't found you yet.
Your story would make a better movie than that
"Serpico" shit.  But I tell ya Scagnetti, in
all my years in the penal business -- and I
tell ya that's no small number    Mickey and
Mallory Knox are without doubt the most
twisted, depraved group of shitfucks it's ever
been my displeasure to lay my eyes on.  I mean,
these two rat fucks are a walkin' reminder of
just how fucked up our system really is.

SCAGNETTI
Don't get me started, Warden.

MCCLUSKY
Dwight, you call me Dwight, Scagnetti. You up
to date?

SCAGNETTI
They been separated since incarceration --
couple of places?

MCCLUSKY
Semanko and Jessup...

SCAGNETTI
They killed a shitload of inmates and guards?

MCCLUSKY
Three inmates, five guards and a shrink all in
one years' time.

SCAGNETTI
Psychiatrist?

MCCLUSKY
Yeah.  Mickey's better half -- Miss Mallory
strangled his ass when he made the dumbass
mistake of askin' her what her parents done to
her -- and she done it all shot up on
tranquillizers!

FLASHBACK -- PRISON CELL - DAY

The dead PSYCHIATRIST lying on the floor, tongue sticking out of
his face.  MALLORY cuffed to a chair, beaten, right into CAAERA
at the milling, freaked out COPS:

MALLORY
You gonna give me some more time?  I already
got life.  What else you got?  Death?  I'd like
to see you fuckin' try!  I haven't met one
motherfucker here who's shown me shit!!

They WHACK her good.

BACK TO:

INT. PRISON CORRIDORS - DAY

SCAGNETTI (sarcastic)
Oh yeah.  Her parents.  Her father was doin'
her.  So she drowned him in a fish tank.

FLASHBACK - INT. MALLORY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE on a home aquarium with fish swimming around.  Suddenly
Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

SCAGNETTI
The mom they stuffed a sock in her throat and
torched the bitch!
(laughs, cynically)
Her kid brother they left alive.

FLASHBACK - INT. MALLORY'S PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mallory's MOTHER mouth is stuffed with a sock, held down.  A gas
nozzle pouring gasoline all over her.

BACK TO:

MCCLUSKY
Yeah.  My old man beat the tar out of me -- but
I didn't kill him.

SCAGNETTI
Well, it was because they wouldn't give 'em
their blessing to get married.

MCCLUSKY
You gotta be kidding!

SCAGNETTI
No.  Ain't love grand?

MCCLUSKY (roars)
"Ain't love grand."  Ain't that the truth!
It's like that other lie -- "love makes the
world go round."

They laugh together as they go past a new door. A nervous GUARD
whispers to Deputy Wurlitzer.

Suddenly FOUR GUARDS come out of a cell, carrying a badly bloodied
PRISONER.  He's been stabbed over and over.  They hustle him past
McClusky and Scagnetti who keep talking, ignoring the filthy looks
thrown at McClusky from every PRISONER in the cell block.

MCCLUSKY
...so how does a guy like you become a
specialist in psychos?

SCAGNETTI
Well, Dwight, for starters I'd recommend having your
mother killed by one. After that happened, I developed
a rather keen interest in the subject.

MCCLUSKY
What the hell happened?

SCAGNETTI
I was born and spent the first part of my life in Texas.

MCCLUSKY
You don't have an accent?

SCAGNETTI
I don't wanna talk like those assholes.

MCCLUSKY
My mammy was from Texas.

SCAGNETTI
I meant y'know, the assholes I grew up with who
beat the shit outta me...Anyway, one day when I
was five, my mother took me out to play in the
park.  Well, that just so happened to be the
same day that Charles Whitman climbed up to the
top of University of Texas tower and started
shooting strangers.

MCCLUSKY
You was with her?

SCAGNETTI
Sure was.  You see, the thing is I didn't hear
the shots.  I didn't hear any of 'em.  One
minute I'm walking with my mother and then all
of a sudden her chest explodes.  She hits the
ground, right?  I'm just lookin' at her.  Her
forearm flies off.  Then her hip explodes.
Now, I'm not hearing any of these shots.  All I
know is my mother is falling apart in front of
my eyes...

MCCLUSKY
What about you, son?

SCAGNETTI
Some hero grabbed me and threw me behind a
bush.  It took them all goddamn day to get
Charlie.  So, that meant I spent all Goddamn
day lyin' flat on the grass, being eaten alive
by fuckin' ants and thinkin' "What the fuck
happened to my mom?"  Ever since I've had a
strong opinion about the psychopathic fringe
that thrives today in America's fast food
culture.  I tend not to exhibit self-discipline
becoming of a peace officer.

MCCLUSKY
You got a right Jack.  Say, you don't mind,
d'you, if I call you Jack--?

SCAGNETTI (ignores the question)
Not at all. But I tell you what it is.  These
fucks think they're special -- Daddy yanked
their dicks, Momma never game 'em a hug  -- so
they have carte blanche to take innocent life.
(McClusky nods intensely)
They think they're invincible.  I never caught
a killer yet who ever dreamed he might get
caught.  And they all look the same when I
catch 'em -- like little kids with their hands
in the cookie jar.

MCCLUSKY
That's my observation as well.  We have an army
of shrinks who talk about mania and
schizophrenia and multiphrenia and obsessions.
But it's all bullshit.  It's Pride!  Arrogance!
Somewhere, somehow they get the idea they're
better than everyone else -- it makes me sick.
And Mickey and Mallory Knox are the sickest
I've ever seen.

INT. DINING AREA - DAY

They walk through the spotless dining area.  The PRISONERS eat
silently, each one more uptight than the one before him.

The Guards on the catwalks above sense something in the air,
nervous, nodding to the Warden who makes AD LIB INQUIRIES as he
moves.

MCCLUSKY (to prisoner)
Y'all right.

WURLITZER (nervous)
Don't go down that corridor, chief.

McClusky changes direction.

KAVANAUGH (whispers)
Not there either, boss.

MCCLUSKY waits.

SCAGNETTI (shrewd)
So why me, Dwight?  What's this really about?

MCCLUSKY
You feel the silence, Jack!  The silence in the
air?

SCAGNETTI
...yeah?

MCCLUSKY
The one thing you don't want in prison, Jack,
is silence.

Camera coming to rest on a huge BLACK INMATE.  He's not eating.
He's not chewing.  He's not blinking.  The inmates on either side
of him look like they might shit their pants.

The MAN he's looking at is nervous, jacked up on speed.

NERVOUS MAN
Don't focuking you look at me, motherfucker!

The Black Guy goes for him --lunging across the table with a fork
aimed at the jacked up guy's throat.

But McClusky beats him to the punch -- twisting a personalized
medieval instrument of torture -- a thumb cracker or something,
over the inmates' fingers -- breaking them backwards.

The Black Inmate's face shows the agony he is feeling.  As he
finally releases the fork.

GUARDS now surround the TWO PRISONERS and cart them away.

As McClusky renews his walk with Scagnetti, reinvigorated by the
incident.

MCCLUSKY (to Guards)
Put him in F Block for the month.  Then bring
him to me.

SCAGNETTI (impressed)
Jesus Dwight! You should be on "American
Gladiators."

MCCLUSKY
...30 minutes every day, just shake and roll it.
(shaking his body tai-chi style)
...doesn't take much...someone goes for you,
you go right for the throat Jack!
(feints for Scagnetti's throat with a flat palm)
...a chop that paralyzes...you know I got an
office I'm gonna show ya Jack, it's so good I
don't wanna go home at night.  I got a
secretary 23 fuckin' years old.

WURLITZER
Yolanda Bingham.

MCCLUSKY
Got an ass on her like...

KAVANAUGH
...two perfectly round scoops of vanilla ice
cream.

MCCLUSKY
My coffee cup...

WURLITZER
...which says The Boss on it,

MCCLUSKY
...might as well be a bottomless pit.

KAVANAUGH
She puts the fuckin' waitresses at Sambo's
shame.

WURLITZER
And we ain't talkin' lukewarm water poured over
old grounds.

MCCLUSKY
So, tell me why would I want to leave paradise
to come down here and breathe this air and
smell the smell of a bunch of losers?
(pauses, holds Scagnetti's eye)
Cause of you, Jack...
(indicates the prisoners)
Mickey and Mallory did this to 'em.  Got my
whole prison worked up.

WURLITZER
Like sharks to chum bait.

MCCLUSKY
Smell of blood drives 'em nuts.

WURLITZER
80 percent of these assholes are violent offenders...

KAVANAUGH
We're over 200 percent capacity.

MCCLUSKY
This ain't a prison anymore Jack -- it's a timebomb.

SCAGNETTI
So ship 'em out.

KAVANAUGH
Nobody wants 'em

WURLITZER
No state!

MCCLUSKY
I'm even talkin' hellholes where the warden's
hard as a bar of iron.  No one wants these
assholes behind their walls, dealing with 'em

WURLITZER
Day in

MCCLUSKY
Day out.

SCAGNETTI
So fry 'em.

MCCLUSKY
Fuck we tried!  And each fuckin' time they kill
somebody new we got to start the whole legal
process all over again.

WURLITZER
It eats up two to three years.

KAVANAUGH
Mickey is fuckin' diabolical.

MCCLUSKY
He knows...

INT. WOMAN'S CELL BLOCK - DAY

MCCLUSKY
What's his name?

KAVANAUGH
Pete.

MCCLUSKY
Pete, open it up. We got a visitor for the song
bird.

A BUZZER sounds.  A door clanks open.  Soon as it does we hear a
FEMALE VOICE singing "Walking after Midnight" by the Cowboy
Junkies.

SCAGNETTI
So, sounds like a hemorrhoid you can't get rid
of, Dwight.

MCCLUSKY (smiles)
Even hemorrhoids can be cut out Jack.  That's
why we're shipping 'em for testing to Nystrom
with you.

SCAGNETTI
Nystrom?  Lobotomy Bay?

MCCLUSKY
Vegetable land.  Home of the criminally insane.

SCAGNETTI
That hasn't been done in years.

MCCLUSKY
We got a first stage ruling.  It won't stick
with all these asshole do-good shrinks around,
but it gets them under your control for a few
hours.

SCAGNETTI
Yeah?  And then...?

MCCLUSKY
The public loves you Jack...youre a celebrated
lawman.  You busted "M&M."  Twenty six years on
the force, a bestseller out in paperback.

WURLITZER
A modern day Pat Garret with a deadly axe to
grind with maniacs...
(Scagnetti puffing up)

MCCLUSKY
You're a livin' breathing icon of justice and
that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and
Mrs. Knox.  We -- the Prison Board -- we know
that once you get 'em on the road...if anything
should happen...

WURLITZER
an accident

MCCLUSKY
a fire

KAVANAUGH
an escape attempt

ALL
...anything...

MCCLUSKY
Jack "Supercop" Scagnetti would be there to
look out for his public's best interests.

SCAGNETTI
I'm getting the picture here.

MCCLUSKY
...and of course nobody in their right mind
would cry for those two pigfuckers if they
happened to take some lead.  A lotta lead.
(Scagnetti thinking)
You write the script, Jack, call it "Showdown
in Mojave:  The Extermination of Mickey and
Mallory," I don't give a shit ... I'll give you
my two best men (indicating) Kavanaugh and
Wurlitzer. (corrects their names and faces).

WURLITZER
We got a special dislikin' for these punkolas.

MCCLUSKY
Have we found our man?

Hold on Scagnetti as he walks up to Mallory's glassed cell --
very white, very medical.  Inside we hear singing.  An old
friend.  Still fascinating to Jack.

MCCLUSKY
...So here she is...you know her, you love
her, you can't live without her...Mallory Knox.

INT. MALLORY KNOX CELL - DAY

MALLORY (a year older) sings.

MALLORY
"I go out walkin' after midnight
in the moonlight just like we used to do."

MCCLUSKY
Hey Knox!  Somebody out here wants to meet you.

MALLORY
"I'm always walkin' after midnight
searchin' for you..."

Mallory just keeps on truckin.

MALLORY'S POV:  We stare at MCCLUSKY and SCAGNETTI for a second.
Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them.  Mallory
screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars.  Mallory's POV
flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

SCAGNETTI
Jesus Christ!

CAMERA PANS to McClusky smiling.

MCCLUSKY
Don't worry about it.  She does it all the time.

BACK TO:  Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood
trickling out her scalp.

MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
Follow me.

SCAGNETTI
So, uh...where do you keep the other half, Warden?

McClusky walking through ANOTHER DOOR.

MCCLUSKY
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest
cell in the whole dungeon.  But it just so
happens we can't see him right now.  Cause he's
got a special visitor.

SCAGNETTI
Who's that?

MCCLUSKY
Wayne Gale.

SCAGNETTI (surprised)
Wayne Gale!  That TV scumbag.

MCCLUSKY
We call 'em "Media," Jack.  Why, you don't like
the media?

SCAGNETTI
A worm in my blood stool's got more attraction
to me.  This guy lives to fuck cops over.

MCCLUSKY
Can't say no to the media.  You want the job
Jack?  Then come say hello.

INT. JAIL -- SPECIAL VISITING ROOM - DAY

WAYNE GALE,  the young, energetic commando journalist is testing
a small tape recorder, accompanied by a FEMALE ASSISTANT, JULIE,
and TWO GUARDS.  His Australian accent on, he manages to include
everyone in his monologue.  Including his face -- which he likes
to bounce off every reflecting surface he sees, continually
checking himself.  A natural-born narcissist. A BLACK INMATE is
working in the room.

WAYNE (sympathetic)
How ya doin' brother?  Doin' some hard time?
What you in for?

INMATE
Murder.

WAYNE
I'm with you.  (into recorder)
Testing one...two...three...over.  Oh man this
place brings back memories.  I did my first
network interview in this place.  Remember
Sonny "The Beast" Maricopa.

They shake their heads.

WAYNE
Years ago.  Great welterweight.  But dumb --
like all these killers, couldn't count the eyes
in his head.  Beat his bimbo girlfriend to
death, then mutilated her.  Ever box?

DEPUTY WARDEN
A little.  Back when...

WAYNE
Yeah.  I was nowhere near as good as Sonny
but...I could hit.  I had some power.  Some
moves.  I was a dancer...

FLASHBACK - INT. GYM - DAY

A sudden disconnected image of WAYNE beating a bag, lathered
up, a real anger expressing itself.

BACK TO WAYNE - PRESENT

WAYNE (Cont.)
Anyway there I was just another punk kid from
the streets of New York, got a free ride to
Columbia, got out of school, kissed some ass
over at CBS, and my first pony out the gate I
get to interview Sonny Maricopa.  That was
something.

During this, Wayne's expression tightens as he hears the
approaching SLAM of doors and the CLANKING of chains and now the
sound of "his" FOOTSTEPS:


WAYNE
Ohhhkkkaaaay.....showtime

The gate slides open.  MICKEY KNOX is led in by TWO DEPUTIES,
wearing a blue jumpsuit with a thick and wide leather belt around
the waist and metal rings built into each side.  Long sturdy
chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and
through the rings, binding his arms to his sides.  His hands and
feet are double-cuffed.

The DEPUTIES have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in half
at the slightest provocation.  Yet for a man wrapped and bound in.
chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.

He is seated roughly on the prisoner's side of the glass.

Wayne starts to smile but something weird happens.  The smile
gets stuck on his face.  He can't stop smiling his all-American
you-must-love-me smile.  It just hangs there, embarrassing and
noticeable to everyone in the room.

Mickey waits -- what's wrong with this guy?

Finally Wayne gets control of his nerves.

WAYNE
Hi, Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm...I'm
Wayne Gale. (starts to laugh again) Oh jeesus! Oh god!

MICKEY (cutting it short)
Hey.  I know who you are.  You're famous...

WAYNE
Hey I could say the same about you. (smiles) I
want to thank you for seeing me. (Mickey waits)
I have a television show.  Every few weeks as
part of our look at current America we profile
a different serial killer.  You don't mind if I
call you a serial killer, do you?

MICKEY (shrugs)
Technically, mass murderer.

WAYNE
Whatever. The episode we did on Mickey and
Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

MICKEY
Y'ever do one on John Wayne Gacy?

WAYNE
Yes.

MICKEY
Whose ratings were higher?

WAYNE
Yours.

MICKEY
How 'bout Ted Bundy?  Ever do one on him?

WAYNE
Yes.  Yours got the larger Nielsen share.

MICKEY
Good.  Yuppie piece of shit.

WAYNE
What I'd like to do --

MICKEY
How 'bout Manson?

WAYNE
Manson beat you.

MICKEY
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.

WAYNE (indicating Julie)
Julie, my producer...and I...
(Julie nods; she's mute)
...we've been waiting to do a follow-up episode
on you for a long time.  And that time has
definitely come
(encouraged, Julie makes a strange, grunting sound
of approval)
I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to
what's going on that the Prison Board has
thrown the Constitution straight out the
fuckin' window.  You and Mallory may be killers
but nuts, insane? NOT.  You're being
railroadedinto a hospital for the sole purpose
of turning you into a vegetable.  Now some
people are saying, "So what."  I am not one of
those people.  If we avert our eyes while they
do this to you, we give them permission to do
it again whenever they see fit.  Today, they
wipe clean your mind because they feel your
actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean
my mind -- or dump me in syndication -- because
they feel what I say is dangerous.  Where does
it all end?  That's my angle.

No response from Mickey.

WAYNE (looks at Julie and back to Mickey)
My problem Mickey, is you don't exactly inspire
empathy.  I'm all alone on this.  I need your
help.  I have interviews with the Prison Board,
with Warden Dwight McClusky -- and I'm telling
ya Mickey, they look bad.  The two
psychologists they used for their kangaroo
court won't talk to us -- which also looks bad.
I have an interview with the judge at your
trial Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and
famous author Emil Reignold -- both of which
discount the notion you're insane.  What we
need now is YOU.  You haven't talked to the
press since your trial.  Now a few days before
you get transferred to an asylum, you give an
exclusive to Wayne Gale.  We're talking a media
event here.  A 40/50 share.  We run this during
the Sweeps, the network'll be creaming for it,
promos on the Super Bowl -- (new idea) hey,
I'll even ask 'em to program it same day as the
Super Bowl!  Right after it!  They might go for
it. Television history.  The first sit down, in-
depth interview with the most charismatic
serial killer ever, one day before he's being
shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of
his life.  This is Wallace with Noriega, Elton
John confessing his bi-sexuality to Rolling
Stone, this is the Maysles Brothers at
Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews.

INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - DAY

Watching them through one-way glass are the WARDEN and SCAGNETTI.

WAYNE
Every sonofabitch out there witha TV's gonna be
looking at you Mickey, listening to your words.
Sell 'em on your sanity.  You're composed, you're
articulate, you may be a cold-blooded killer but
you're obviously not a nut.  We'll shame 'em into
dropping the whole thing.  Whattaya say?

MICKEY
You got any gum?

Wayne has a duty free bag filled with items -- gum, multi-
vitamins, fruit shakes, health food.

WAYNE
Gum, spearmint, big red? Multi-vitamins? I even
got a fruit shake.

MICKEY
You got a guitar you can give me?

WAYNE (hopeful)
I'll bring a guitar next time!

MICKEY (pause)
You talked to Mallory about this?

WAYNE
She won't see me Mickey.  Now you're not
supposed to know anything about what's going on
with her, but since you two been sentenced,
Mallory hasn't spoken one word.  All she does
is sing.

MICKEY
She sings?  What does she sing?

WAYNE
Songs.  "He's a Rebel" "Leader of the pack,"
that Dusty Springfield tear-jerker, "I Only
Want To Be With You."  Her behavior's the main
thing the doctors used against you.  So even if
she'd see me which she won't, I can't put her
on camera anyway.  If I ask her, Mallory, are
you insane?"  And she starts singing, "Dead
Skunk in the Middle of the Road," that blows
our whole case.

Mickey cracks a smile.  The GUARD comes over to take him away.

DEPUTY
Time, motherfucker!

WAYNE (jumping up)
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!  Civilization
rules here, civilization!  Let him answer
me...Come on Mickey, whaddaya say?  Time is
running out...

Pause.  Mickey being pulled up by the Guards, strangely in
control.  CAMERA suddenly TRUCKING in on him -- a bizarre sound
as if a plan has now kicked off in his malevolent mind.

MICKEY (quietly)
I say, go for it...

He exits with Guards. Wayne stunned, turns to Julie.

WAYNE
"Yes!"  Am I God or what!  This saves us,
Jules, this saves us.  That asshole didn't know
it but we were over, we were history,
shitcanned.  This gives us another whole
season!  Takes us to the end of the year!  I'll
renegotiate with network, million dollars more
on the contract, maybe Sunday night, maybe you
get a little more money...One fucking "Yes,"
Yes! Yes! Yes!

INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - SIMULTANEOUS DAY

SCAGNETTI has the opposite reaction.

SCAGNETTI
Why the hell you lettin' that scumbag do this,
Dwight?

MCCLUSKY
Relax. If I don't, we'll be excoriated in the
press. If I do, it'll be weeks before they
clear it.

WURLITZER
Legal, appeals.

MCCLUSKY
And M & M are gonna be post toasties before
that ever happens, right Jack?  And no one's
gonna give a flying fuck about two dead losers.

INT. VISITING ROOM - DAY

The WARDEN, followed by SCAGNETTI, enters the room, smiling.

MCCLUSKY (to Wayne)
Everything all right Mr. Gale?

WAYNE, seeing the Warden, switches character instantly.

WAYNE
Warden McClusky -- a man made for the camera.
Too bad James Arness just kicked off. And Ted
Danson's busy.  He would've been just perfect
for your life story.

MCCLUSKY (chuckling)
How 'bout Johnny Cash? Is he available? Maybe
you know Jack Scagnetti -- he's gonna be
helping us with the transfer.

Wayne, affable, shakes hands.  Scagnetti treats him like vermin.

WAYNE
Of course.  America's favorite cop.  "Scagnetti
on Scagnetti" great book -- makes me want to do
one of my own.  You paved the way Jack...

SCAGNETTI
And you shit on it you little turkey-neck.

WAYNE
Turkeyneck, eh? Am I? You better get back on
the stairmaster, Scagnetti.

MCCLUSKY
Boys boys.

WAYNE
Heh heh Jack isn't too fond of our show; we
sometimes give the B.O.D. to the defendants.
You know "human rights" --

MCCLUSKY
B.O.D.?

WAYNE
"Benefit of the doubt"

SCAGNETTI
What doubt?  Mickey and Mallory are turds, you
little sissy. Australia is a penal colony,
isn't it.  The only doubt I got is you --

MCCLUSKY (contains him)
Uh Jack! ... Jack's sort of our avenging angel
you might say.

WAYNE
In any case, he says yes.

MCCLUSKY
I figured he would.  But I want to keep contact
with the population to a minimum.

EXT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

The WARDEN shuttling the GROUP back out into the CELLBLOCKS,
towards the exit.

MCCLUSKY (Cont'd)
They hate Mickey Knox in here.  They see him as
a publicity hound.  It's bound to stir 'em up.
It's gotta be done my way.

WAYNE
No problem.  Just give me a big room and I'll
take it from there.  We're "stealth"
journalists.

As they walk off, we hear:

WAYNE (Cont'd)
My crew is the crew that got inside the Shining
Path for a face to face with Abimayel Guzman
while the BBB was stuck at the airport
scratching their nuts.  If I were you, chief,
I'd worry more about the promos that start
hitting the air next week.  You're a
national face, Warden -- a real hero to the
American public.  You run a
damn impressive ship here.  And...frankly, who
knows?  Something like this could launch a new
career in public office for you.  So I'll have
my producer Julie call you in the morning to
work out the details.  I got a plane to catch
right now to New York.

CUT TO:

INT. MICKEY KNOX CELL - DAY

CAMERA drifting to MICKEY lying on his bunk. A high security
single cell. Lawbooks, no pinups, a fax, a telephone,
television.  He writes Mallory a letter.

MICKEY (V.O.)
Dearest Mallory...You once told me I had no
feelings.  You were right and you were wrong.
I got more feelings now than I ever had before.
I never missed someone like I miss you.  My
cell is so cold.  At night I get the chills.
pretend you're lying next to me,holding me from
behind with your leg draped over mine and your
arms wrapped tightly around me.  I lie in my
cell...

WIDE SHOT off the cell.

DISSOLVING TO:

INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

Not knowing where we are, CAMERA moves across a wall into a CU of
MALLORY.

MICKEY (V.O.)
...and imagine kissing you.  Not making love,
just kissing for hours and hours on end.  I
remember everything about our time.  I remember
every joke you ever told.

INT. MICKEY CELL - DAY

CLOSE UP of the LETTER being written over the WIDE SHOT of the
cell.

MICKEY (V.O.)
I remember every secret you ever shared.
Shared or revealed?  I think shared is proper.
I remember every single time you laughed.

ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes.  We can hear
Mallory's laugh -- a distant haunting echo.

MICKEY (V.O.)
I remember every meal we ever ate.  I remember
your cooking.  I remember watching David
Letterman.

We hear the echo of television laughter.

MICKEY (V.O.)
I remember driving fast behind the wheel of the
Dodge Challenger.

The sound of the Dodge Challenger swells as we...

INTERCUT TO:

INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

MALLORY is moving her body in the middle of the cell to a music
only she can hear, then begins to sing "All of Me" (B. Holiday)
in slow acapella, using the cell as the stage and a man who isn't
there as her audience.

MALLORY (singing)
I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take ALL OF ME.

MICKEY (V.O.)
You, baby, by my side.  Your bare feet up on
the dash, singing along with the radio, "He's A
Rebel,"  "Ring of Fire," "Groove Me,"...and
your dancing, my God, your dancing.  I lie on
my bed and go over every day, every minute of
our happiness.  Every day take a day of our
time and go through it hour by hour.  I don't
jump ahead either.  I take it as it comes, and
I live that day again.  That way when I get to
our first kiss...

DISSOLVE TO:

FLASHBACK

INT. MALLORY'S PARENTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The set is sitcom TV format.  The lighting is flat, the
performances and timing are TV.  It is SHOT in three camera
SITCOM FORMAT -- possibly BLACK and WHITE, harkening back to an
earlier era in Mickey's mind.  The time when he first saw TV.

MICKEY (V.O.)
...they're not just memories.  I feel that joy
again.  And I am no longer in prison.  We're
together again.  And when my head hurts and I
can remember no longer, I write you letters and
send them telepathically to your heart.

MALLORY gets a big handful of AUDIENCE APPLAUSE as she comes down
the stairs, dressed to the nines, punky, sexy, ready to trot --
yet a sweet girl's expression, maybe with braces.

MALLORY
Hello Dad, how was work?

DAD is a strange-looking hombre, seated at the table, exhausted
and angry in a dirty undershirt.

DAD
Work?  What work! I'm unemployed.  Three years.
I'm unemployed.
(LAUGHTRACK)

MOM is always-smiling with cracked-egg eyes, serving him a large
salt cracker with pea soup.

MOM
You look nice, Mallory.

Her younger brother, KEVIN, is doing his homework at the table.

KEVIN
Yuck. She looks like...uccckkk.
(LAUGHTRACK)

MALLORY (ignoring Kevin)
Thanks Mom.  I'm late. I'll be back by midnight.

DAD
What are you wearing? A broom stick in a trash
bag.  A few pounds lighter and you'd be Miss
Ethiopia. Where the hell do you think you're
going?

MALLORY
To the John Lee Hooker concert.  With Donna.  I
told you yesterday.

Dad rises and tracks her across the living room.  She's evidently
not going anywhere tonight in his mind.

DAD
First off, you don't tell me anything, you ask
my permission.  Second, you can't go out in
that whorehouse dress.  Third, you can't go out
at all.  You didn't mow the yard.

Mom keeps her smile intact.  But Mallory loses her schoolgirl
sheen and becomes the Mallory we know and love.

MALLORY
That piece of shit lawnmower is fucked!  How am I
supposed to use it?

Dad backs her into the wall, puts his hand on her face, his thumb
on her lip.  She's scared.

DAD
You fuckin' little douchebag cunt, you watch your
language in front of your mother.  I'll kick the
shit outta you just like I do her.  Just remember
you stupid bitch, you shit brown just like me.

Mom just shakes her head at Dad's shenanigans and keeps setting
the table.

BROTHER KEVIN
Mom do we have any croutons?

MOM
Sure Kevie.

At the base of the stairs, Dad feels around Mallory's ass.  She
writhes in disgust.

DAD
This is my house.  It doesn't matter how much you
wag your ass in my face.  If it's in my house,
it's my ass.  Got it?  So take it upstairs and
take a shower.  Make sure it's a good shower.
Cause I'm coming up after to see how clean you are.

Mallory runs upstairs really upset.  Dad reconfigures himself,
sits back down at the table.

MOM
Don't you think you were a little hard on her, dear?
(LAUGHTER)

BROTHER KEVIN
Yeah Dad.  Mallory can't fix a broken bobbypin.
How's she gonna fix a lawnmower? (LAUGHTER)

DAD
I'll show her a...little "tenderness" after I eat (wink).
When I get up there, she won't see my face for an hour.

LAUGHTER.  The DOORBELL ringing.  Dad gets up but Mom stops him.

MOM
That's probably Donna.  I'll break the news to
her.  Don't let your macaroni get cold, Ed.

But when Mom opens the door, it's MICKEY who steps in, dressed as
a meatman with a big box of beef, blood all over his apron.  The
APPLAUSE is deafening.  GIRLS in the audience SCREAM his name.
Mickey hangs five for the recognition as he puts down the beef.

MICKEY
Delivery for Ed Wilson.

MOM
What on earth is it?

MICKEY
It's beef lady.  Fifty pounds of beef.

MOM
Well...wait here.  I need to have a word with
my husband (exiting to kitchen).

Mallory stands on the stairs, getting a good look at him.  His
apron smeared with old blood.

MALLORY
Who are you?

MICKEY
I'm Mickey.  Who are you?

MALLORY
I'm Mallory.

MICKEY
You're "beautiful."
(Mallory melts at the appreciation, a look of
embarrassment at the camera)
You a big meat eater, Mallory?

MALLORY
I can be.

MICKEY
You always dress like that, or were you waitin' for me?

MALLORY
Why would I be waitin' for someone I don't even
know?

MICKEY
Well...maybe something's inside you told you to
get ready...ever think about that?...Fate.  You
believe in fate, Mallory?

MALLORY
Maybe..

MICKEY
You don't look too happy.  How bout we go for a
ride?...Talk about it.

She smiles.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

MOM is scolding DAD, her hands on her hips.

MOM
You promised your doctor, Ed -- no more meat.

DAD
I eat what I want! So what! This food here (her
food) you pray after you eat.

Mom cries.

MOM
I just don't want your arteries to clog up and
then you'll keel over at the table.

DAD
Don't fuckin' cry.  It turns me off!

MOM
I haven't cried in 20 years and you still
haven't touched me...
(big laughter)

DAD (pointing at Kevin)
What about him?

MOM
You thought you were in Mallory's room.  That's
why we have Kevin.

KEVIN
What?

MOM
(going back to the Living Room)
I'm sending it back.  I don't care what you do
to me.

The SOUND of BURNING RUBBER.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

MOM and DAD RUN out.  The beef remains, with a note which Dad
grabs.

DAD
"Out with the meat man.  Back before dawn.
Love Mallory."...that cunt!

MOM (at the window)
They stole your car!

DAD
That meatman cocksucker!  I'll get him too.
Call the cops!

INT. PRISON -- VISITING ROOM - DAY (TWO YEARS LATER)

MALLORY, 2 years older, the braces gone, is visiting her love,
MICKEY, who's taking on convict mannerisms -- early stages that
are refined into the later, more famous Mickey.  He's doing 2
years for car theft.  They are embracing, sitting down, in a room
full of reunited FAMILIES.

NOTE:  The shooting style reverts back to 16 mm black and white --
two young lovers.

MICKEY
Everything I see, I see you Mall.

MALLORY
I know baby.  I'm goin' crazy too...

MICKEY
Even ugliness looks beautiful cause of you.  Even
though I'm here, I visit you every night.

MALLORY
I know Mickey...I can't break away from you
either, but you gotta listen...My Dad is moving
us away so you can't never find us.  He's
insane...He knows you're getting out next
month.  He got a doctor to say you raped me and
he's gonna bring more charges.

MICKEY
He can't keep me away from you.

MALLORY
He says if you ever show up he'll kill you.

MICKEY
When's this supposed to happen?

MALLORY
He won't say.  Look, I've gotta go.  If he
finds out I'm gone he'll beat me...I just
wanted to see you...I love you Mickey.  Please
don't forget me.

MICKEY
It's cool.  It won't matter where he takes you,
to Timbuktu...I told you we're fate. They can't
stop fate...Nobody can...it won't matter.

She looks at him deeply.

MALLORY
Bye.

MICKEY
One of these nights, I'll be coming to see ya.

On Mickey's face as she exits.

EXT. FARMLAND - DAY

A BLACK CLOUD rolls in.  The WIND is blowing.  A STORM is brewing.

MICKEY is part of a Jail WORKCREW breaking MUSTANGS -- guarded by
ARMED MEN on horseback (with shotguns)

Suddenly a large FUNNEL CLOUD touches down. A TORNADO zigzags
crazily up the road--more and more immense. The end of the world.

The WORKBOSS is yelling for the men to get back to the bus.

EVERYONE is running for the road.

The TORNADO is moving in fast.

But Mickey, lost in all the blowing and confusion, has taken off
down the road, heading straight at the tornado.

One of the GUARDS takes off after him...fires a shot.

Mickey is running his ass off, straight into the twisting
devil...obviously a PROCESS SHOT is looming here.

The HORSEMAN is gaining on Mickey, fires again.  But the horse is
spooked by the storm and THROWS the Guard.

As the Man hits the ground, he discharges the shotgun right into
himself -- blowing his chest out.

Mickey is last seen as a tiny man disappearing into the TORNADO --
arms extended as if he were embracing Death itself.

INT. MALLORY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She lays in bed, hears a car SCREECH up.  Knows it's him.  Runs
downstairs.  Tonight will be the night!

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

DAD is watching wrestling on TV in his underwear ("go on, break
his arm!  Do something!  What do we got here...2 fuckin' faggots!
Kill each other!") But it is no longer the sitcom style -- we are
in 16 mm hard-edged film format.

DAD (to Mallory running to the door)
Where the fuck do you think you're going! Get
back upstairs!

MALLORY
I'm going OOOUT!!

The door BLASTS OPEN.  MICKEY -- all fucked up from the storm,
cuts, bruises, is on Dad like lightning struck a demon.
Hitting him with a tire iron.

MICKEY
Hey Jack, Mickey's back.

But Dad doesn't go down.  He fights back.

Tipping the scale, Mallory jumps on her dad's back -- liberated
at last -- kicking him, tearing his eyes out!  It goes round and
round.

Mickey hits him again. Dad's dazed.

They stuff his head in the fish tank.  They hold him down.  Dad
drowns.

MICKEY
Where's the old bag?

INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MOM comes awake from an open-mouthed snore -- terrified eyes as:

MICKEY stuffs a sock, soaked in gasoline, into her throat,
shutting her up.

The rest of her is sprayed with gasoline from the can Mickey is
holding.

CLOSE UP of a MATCH being lit.

MALLORY holds it in front of her face for a moment.

MOM begging for her life with her daughter.  Her words muffled by
the sock:

MOM
Oh God.  Don't please don't Mallory!

Mallory tosses the match.  We hear ignition.

INT. STAIRS/HALLWAY - NIGHT

Mickey and Mallory exit the room on the run, freezing as
Mallory's little brother, KEVIN, stares at them in his nightshirt
from the hallway.

Mallory makes a farewell gesture.

MALLORY
You're free!

They run out.

EXT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT (PROCESS SHOT)

MICKEY and MALLORY flying blind to their freedom.  Outrageous
STARS whirl and collide above them.

MALLORY
Wherever we go, whatever happens Mickey, when I
look up at the stars, I'll know you're looking
at the same ones.

MICKEY (sweet)
The same ones, baby.

MALLORY
Mickey.

MICKEY
Yeah.

MALLORY
You make every day like kindergarten.

EXT. RIO GRANDE GORGE - DAY

They're standing by an old iron BRIDGE looking down into an enormous
100-foot drop into the feisty waters of the Rio Grande.

All their last clothes and possessions sail over.

MALLORY even lets her favorite teddy bear go.

MICKEY takes both her hands.

MICKEY
Mall, it's time to grow up, we got the road to
hell in front of us...will you marry me?

MALLORY
Oh Mickey I been ready for so long, but where
we gonna have our wedding Mickey?

MICKEY
Right here. This is our church, Mall.

They notice, for the first time, the beauty of the land and water
around them.  They look at each other.

MALLORY
Oohh.  I'm so excited!
(goes to the car and pulls out a headdress)
I got the perfect thing.

Mickey takes out his knife and slits his left hand.

He takes Mall's right hand and slits it.

MALLORY
Oh, it's not what I had in mind.

They clasp their hands, mixing blood. He hikes Mall and himself
up closer to the railing so they are looking directly down into
the plummeting gorge.

They watch as the blood drips from their hands into the river
below (ANIMATION OPTION). Mickey pulls out the two wedding rings
he's been saving.

MALLORY (quietly)
...we'll be livin' in all the oceans now.

MICKEY
God...before you and this river and all the
things we don't know about...Do you Mickey take
Mallory to be your wife, to stay with her and
treat her right -- till you die?
(answering himself)
I do.

A TRUCKLOAD OF INDIANS drive by looking at these gringos.

MICKEY (Cont'd)
Mallory, do you take Mickey to be your husband,
and love him till you die?

MALLORY
For all eternity until you and I and you die and die
and die again. Till death do us part! Yes, yes, yes.

MICKEY
Then baby...we're man and wife.

He puts the rings on their fingers. And they kiss joyfully.

INSERT - TELEVISION FILM - "AMERICAN MANIACS"

WAYNE GALE is once again standing on HIGHWAY 666 right next to a
shot-up roadsign.

WAYNE TV
...after that there was no stopping Mickey and
Mallory.  They tore up the countryside with a
vengeance right out of the Bible.  In the
course of 3 weeks that stretched down this
Highway -- 666 -- to some a beautiful stretch of
American landscape, to others the fastest
distance between Cortez and Gallup, but to
Mickey and Mallory a candy lane of murder
and chaos.  As they slaughtered 48 people --
innocent people, people they never met before,
total strangers -- all killed to fill the
fantasies of these love-crazed narcissist
psychopaths...

INT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY

WAYNE GALE is looking at himself on tape with his CAMERA and
EDITING CREW and JULIE, the assistant.  They're in an editing
"session," rolled up sleeves, coffee, cigarettes, donuts, bagels.
A mirror is close by.

WAYNE (involved)
...not bad, not bad.  Maybe trim that look...
and go for the close-up there when I say "love-
crazed-narcissistic etcetera."

DAVID (bright young editor)
...we really raped and pillaged the first show
to do this.

ROGER (cameraman)
...but we changed the order around so it wasn't
super obvious.

DAVID
...it still needs a new intro in my opinion
Wayne, you can't cannibalize yourself all the
time or...

WAYNE
Repetition works, David, you think those
schmucks out there in zombieland remember
anything.  It's junkfood for the brains.  It's
filler, fodder -- just build for the interview.
Keep using that word -- "Live Interview."
Anticipation, David -- that's all it's about,
the next bite of chocolate, the next car, the
next vacation, the next life, next -- that's
all.  'Just do it.'

DAVID (making a tape cut)
Heil, mein Fuhrer!

DEBORAH, another assistant, hands him a cellular phone.

suburbs of Chicago...and they finally caged
here at this All-Nite Pharmacy in the small New
Mexico town of Jerome -- not far from the

wildly behind the THREE WINDBREAKER COPS & SCAGNETTI on MICKEY,
clobbering him for camera.

Gerald -- three weeks out of the Academy
came walking out with our coffee and --

my bear claw.  When the driver of the car asked
him something...

EXT. DONUT SHOP - DAY

A cinema verite recreation of the crime, a la "COPS," shot in 16
mm color.  Moving in fast on TV GERALD, who has little
resemblance to the photograph of Real Gerald.

DALE (V.O.)
Gerald started giving him what looked like
street directions.  When he finished, the
driver waved him "thanks," brought up a shotgun
and --

Pandemonium!  The shadowed figures of TV MICKEY and TV MALLORY
firing a blast.  TV Gerald flying backward with pumped "sound"
effects.

TV DALE, another actor type with little resemblance to the real
Dale, is jumping out of his car, gun pulled, in futile anger as:

TV Mickey peels his car out -- leaving a really bloodied corpse
of TV Gerald on the pavement, bear claws and donuts and coffee
heaped over him.

BLACK & WHITE PHOTO of Alfie's DONUT SHOP.  A white grease
pencil circles where REAL GERALD is shot.  We hear another
shotgun BLAST and a SCREAM over this.

LAUGHTER and a car PEELING OUT over this.

INT. COP CAR - MOVING - HIGHWAY - DAY

TV DALE is pursuing MICKEY and MALLORY -- FIRING rounds out his
side window as he drives.

TV DALE (into radio)
I am currently in high pursuit!  Send back up!
Send back up!

INT. MICKEY CAR - MOVING - HIGHWAY - DAY

TV MICKEY is weaving back and forth on the road like Steve
McQueen in "Le Mans."  TV MALLORY is hanging out the window,
FIRING her shotgun, laughing her head off.  She sees something
that gets her attention.

WAYNE TV (V.O.)
...in the ensuing chase, they even managed to
kill American marathon bicyclist, Bryan Smyj,
who was in the wrong place at the wrong time,
only because...

Mallory passing a BICYCLIST decked out in colors, flying down
the road, sucking on a water bottle.  Threatened by the vehicles
barreling down the road at war, he shoots Mallory the finger.

Like a skilled trap-and-skeet shooter, Mallory whips her shotgun
left, tracks the fast-moving target, and gleefully BLASTS the

Cyclist off the bike, then whips her shotgun back onto the
oncoming Cop.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As the CYCLIST flies off the road, the TWO CARS whip through the
FRAME, one at a time, SPITTING gunfire.

REAL MALLORY (V.O.)

football bleachers.

Sick, isn't it?

Renaissance psychopaths that they were -- and
obviously bored with conventional robbery and
murder, they would always leave one clerk or

WAYNE interview THREE LONG HAIRED GUYS, cinema verite style,
jumpcutting their response time.

KID 1
Hot.

KID 2
Hot.

KID 3
Totally hot.

KID 1
Mickey and Mallory are the best thing to happen
to mass murder since Manson.

KID 2
But they're way cooler...

KID 3
They're romantic, I dunno...

KID 1
I'm not saying y'know I believe in mass murder
or that shit, but...

Don't get us wrong.

murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory.

Morrison, Jack Nicholson...add a bloody pale of

cause. Only nobody knows what it is.

LONDON GIRL (screaming)
Their cause is each utter!

TWO JAPANESE TEENS dressed like the Knox's speak in Japanese

FRENCH GIRL (in English)
They are super cool!

INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - DAY

WAYNE is interviewing Dr. EMIL REINGOLD who talks to us with an
impressive manner. His name on a TITLE CARD underneath.

DR. REINGOLD
...Mickey and Mallory's operatic devotion to each
other. In a world where people can't seem to make
the simplest of relationships work and the slightest
emotional commitment is considered devastating,
Mickey and Mallory have a do or die romance of a
Shakespearian magnitude. To the country's youth, 75
percent of whom are coming from broken homes, they
have an us-against-the world posture which youth
loves. And they've taken that posture 10 steps
beyond. Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country
ntimb with violence. They've created a world where
only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters
that world is murdered...

Wayne going at it on a cellular conference call.

He knows the footage, bored.

WAYNE (in phone)
Bill...Bill listen to me...if you advertise that we'll
hit a 75 awareness. By Wednesday!  By Saturday we'll be
85, 90 climbing...by Sunday morning only homeless
morons living in parks won't know we're there! We'll
eviscerate "60 Minutes" -- they'll be a spark in a
distant galaxy fart. We're LIVE Don, hello! Anybody in?
Right after the Superbowl! We got 'em in their houses,
angry, the Game's just sucked (it always does), and
they wanna see this guy Mickey. What makes him tick! Is
he like me! The guy wants to tear apart his wife! His
best friend he wants to kill. Recent statistics show
that more husband-wife beatings take place during and
after sports events than at any other...listen, Bill,
this is Don King and Muhammed Ali in the Jungle,
Michael Jackson at the SuperBowl! The most talked about
event in television history. Books will be written ...
So?  Who cares, it's a book for chrisakes, who the fuck
reads a book. Don Don listen to Jim, talk to Don -- who
can stop live TV? Nobody. You blow this and NBC'll be
eating your lunch next season, and I'll be there too
... With Letterman.  And you'll be cleaning out gorilla
shit and reptile cages in pet stores, you better
fuckin' believe me for once.  Cause ... 'cause I am
outta here!...I'm out unless...unless yeah...you
know...yeah...at least a mill...maybe 2 we're talkin'
now...should've signed me a month ago. Peanuts!  Fox
was offerin' more.  Lobotomy Bay.  Right...yeah right...

ON TV CONT'D:

DR. REINGOLD (Cont'd)
Insane, no.  Psychotic, yes. But to suggest
that they're insane gives the impression that
they don't know right from wrong.  Mickey and
Mallory know the difference between right and
wrong.  They just don't give a damn.

WAYNE TV (in front of courthouse)
It was Dr. Reingold who Mallory Knox strangled
six months after this interview.

FREEZE FRAME ON REINGOLD

WAYNE (to the editors)
Rrrrrnnnnggg. Commercial.  How to brush your
teeth. How to get an enema, how to live
longer. Fanfuckingtastic! But less of the
shrink.  Keep the teens, the long hairs, love
the cop at the donut shop, love the Warden,
he's so dumb McClusky, he still thinks he's the
good guy. Cut in right when he's on that
horrific fuckin' laugh. Freeze frame on the
laugh (the Warden displays a rictus of francis
bacon madness on his face)...don't even let him
answer. Fuck him. He's such an idiot. Then cut
to me talking with the Huns...

JULIE (sign language, subtitled)
Should we shoot film on Mickey?  For posterity?
Maybe a PBS; gives us library value; give us
some respect for a change, maybe an Emmy?

DAVID
Fat fuckin' chance.

WAYNE
Yes!  Great idea Julie!  Same time as the video. I
see... high contrast sixteen millimeter black and white.
And I mean black and white, where the black's black and
the white's white.  For history.  For prosperity.

DAVID

You're right, David.  Prosterity. Film!

INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY

WAYNE TV
...Even their victims fell in love with Mickey

WAYNE'S standing in a GYM.  Behind him MUSCLE MEN and WOMEN are
working out; their GRUNTS fill the BG.  Wayne turns off camera
into an ECU of two heads belonging to the famous bodybuilder
twins, SIMON and NORAAN HUN.  Their names appear in a subtitle
card below screen.

WAYNE
Simon and Norman Hun, what do you think of
Mickey and Mallory?

SIMON
I admire them.

NORMAN
I do, too.

WAYNE (confused)
But how can you say that?

SIMON
They're mesmerizing.

NORMAN
Have you seen "Pumping Iron?"

WAYNE
Yes.

SIMON
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold
Schwarzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.

WAYNE
Yes.

NORMAN
Through the power of the simple word --

SIMON
And a snake-eye glare --

NORMAN
-- and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to
totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.

SIMON
He squashed him mentally before physically
defeating him.

NORMAN
He had the edge.  The mind's edge.

SIMON
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

NORMAN
They've hypnotized the nation.

SIMON
Schwarzenegger was the king of the edge before
they came along

ZOOM BACK to WAYNE.

WAYNE
Yet you two are both victims of Mickey and
Mallory?

SHOT now ZOOMS back to reveal that both Simon and Norman are in
wheelchairs (their legs maimed or gone).

SIMON & NORMAN
Yes.

WAYNE
How can you say you "admire" them?

NORMAN
It's like this, Wayne.  Two people are standing
in a dark room waiting for the other to attack.
These two people can't see each other, yet they
know they're there.  Now, they can either stand
in that dark room forever waiting until they
die of boredom, or one of them can make the
first move.

WAYNE
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?

NORMAN
They can't because neither knows if the other
is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs.
So, you may as well make the first move.

WAYNE
Obviously they made the first move.

NORMAN
Unfortunately, yes.

SIMON
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

WAYNE
Why?

SIMON
They passed the 'edge' along to us, Wayne.

WAYNE
How so?

SIMON
By taking away our legs.  Now we have to fight
harder to get ahead than anyone else in the
gym.  Probably the whole city.  They gave us
the fighting spirit.  Before this happened I
was content.  Now I'm pissed off.  Now I'm half
a man and I've got to work like the devil to
get whole again.

WAYNE
But you'll never be whole again.

SIMON
Never is a very long time, Wayne.  A word only
the weak use.  I'm not a sore loser.  Even if I
don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get
up and fight this world until I'm on top again.

NORMAN
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

SIMON
And that's the way of the world.

NORMAN
They're just shocking the world into
remembering the primal law.

SIMON
Survival of the fittest.

WAYNE
One last question, boys.  Usually Mickey and
Mallory kill all their victims except for the
lucky one.  How come they let you two survive?

The brothers pause, turn to Wayne.

NORMAN
They had us hogtied down during one of their
house-raids, and they were taking chainsaws to
our legs before they were gonna kill us.

FLASHBACK - INT. HUN BROTHERS' HOUSE - NIGHT

MICKEY and MLLLORY are carving the BROTHERS up with chainsaws --
hidden in shadows.  A demonic humor to the scene.

BACK TO SIMON.  The sound of the CHAINSAW echoes over:

SIMON
Just for fun, I guess.

NORMAN
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, "Hey,
these are the Brothers."

SIMON
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, "Oh my
God, I'm your biggest fan."

FLASHBACK -- Micky's look of genuine admiration as he stops
the sawing.

NORMAN
Apparently, they've seen all our films.

SIMON
They were especially influenced by "Conquering
Huns of Neptune."

NORMAN
So Mallory calls 911 and they took off.

SIMON
They actually apologized.

subsequent trial turned into a sick circus...

JUMP TO:

FILE FOOTAGE (Mickey's Trial): -- grainy large CROWD
circling the courthouse, a very mixed bag.

WAYNE TV (V.O.)
As spectators, reporters, law students,
tourists, gawkers, the devoted and the demented
were drawn to the Illinois courthouse like
moths to a flame.  The Mickey and Mallory Knox
murder trial was such an event that it made the
crime spree that preceded it pale by
comparison.  The nation caught Mickey and
Mallory fire.

EXTERIOR COURTROOM (PRESENT) - DAY

WAYNE walking, into camera, looking back at the courthouse.  The
location is desolate.

WAYNE TV
The very first thing that was strange was the
decision of Mickey's to act as his own counsel.
Now this in itself is not unheard of; for
instance, Ted Bundy acted as his own counsel as
well.  What was unexpected was how spectacular
Mickey's performance would be.

INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

WAYNE interviews JUDGE BERT STEINSMA in his courtroom office.

WAYNE TV (V.O.)
We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was the
presiding judge during the Knox trial...

JUDGE STEINSMA TV

lasted five days.  But I breathed a sigh of
relief when Mickey showed up and he was very
prepared, and proved to be an excellent amateur
lawyer.

WAYNE interviews state prosecutor WANDA BISBING, a stern woman in
her forties.

WAYNE TV (V.O.)
However, this opinion is not shared by the
state's prosecutor on the case, Wanda Bisbing.

BISBING TV
Oh that's rich.  Considering that Mickey Knox turned his
court into a mockery and personally made him look like a
fool, I'd say that's very benevolent of Judge Steinsma.
As far as Mickey being an excellent lawyer, maybe I'm old
fashioned but when I went to law school, we were taught
the object was to win the case, which I did.

TEENS DURING SLUMBER PARTY!"  In smaller bolder face under it:
"One Teen Escapes Killer's Clutches."  On the front page is a
PHOTO of the teen who escaped.  It's seventeen-vear old GRACE
MULBERRY.  CAMERA moves into a CU of the photo.

WAYNE TV (V.O.)
Of the six teens murdered that night, seventeen-
year old Grace Mulberry was the lucky one left
to tell the tale.  This haunted young lady
summoned up the courage to take the stand, and
tell what she saw that horrible night -- and
then allowed herself to be cross-examined by
the man who killed her brother and girlfriends.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - (MICKEY'S TRIAL) - DAY

As it was then.  A circus.

GRACE, her FATHER and BISBING emerge from the sedan in front of
the COURTHOUSE and start up the steps.  Microphones and cameras
are thrust in their faces.

Grace is afraid to face the crowd.  Her head darts in the
direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

Miss Mulberry!  How does it feel to be the only
survivor of Mickey and Mallory's reign of
terror?

Grace and her Father shove their way through the crowd.  We hear
the cry of:

CAMERA whips towards the bottom the steps as MICKEY and MALLORY
step out of the van, in chains.  The REPORTERS race down the
stairs.  The FANS go apeshit.  As they are led up the stairs by
SHERIFF DEPUTIES.

Yeah, I always regretted we never got around to
looking up my old history teacher, Miss
Bainbridge.  Now there's a big bad bitch not
good for herself or nobody else.

WAYNE
But if you had to do it all over again, would
you do anything different?
(swinging the mike to Mallory; CAMERA following)

MALLORY
Yeah, I'd kill the jury.

CUTE REPORTER 4
Do you have anything to say to your fans!

MICKEY
(looking into CAMERA; big smile)
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

EXT. COURTHOUSE (PRESENT) - DAY

WAYNE by himself on the courthouse steps, to CAMERA:

WAYNE TV
No, apparently not. Grace Mulberry gave her
tearful testimony.  Then it came time for
Mickey Knox's cross-examination.

INT. WANDA BISBING OFFICE - DAY

BISBING TV
Grace was terrified of Mickey.  You have to
understand most of their victims were normal
people with normal lives that nothing out of
the ordinary ever happens to.

CUT TO:

INSERTS -- COURT SKETCH shows Bisbing standing at the bench in
front of Judge Steinsma with Grace on the stand.  Mickey sits
with Mallory at the defense table.

BISBING (V.O.)
Then out of the blue, they're dealing with the
devil incarnate.  It was extremely difficult
for us to find survivors who would take the
stand and testify when they knew Mickey would
be cross-examining them.

INSERT COURT SKETCH of Mickey looking like the devil incarnate,
cross-examining Grace.

INSERT COURT SKETCH of a terrified Grace. CAMERA closes on her
face. The distinct sounds of a court in session can be heard in
the BG.

BISBING (V.O.)
Grace was every bit as terrified, every bit as
haunted.  But she felt her brother Tim and her
five girlfriends were counting on her...

CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM (MICKEY'S TRIAL) - DAY

The camera cranes up over the sketch to GRACE, in tears.

WANDA BISBING (wrapping up)
No further questions your Honor.

CAMERA dollies towards a MEDIUM OVERHEAD TWO SHOT of MICKEY and
MALLORY.  Mickey pauses, sketching something on a piece of paper.
Mallory looks over at it, still unseen.

JUDGE STEINSMA
Defense?

MICKEY (extending the moment)
As a matter of fact, your Honor, I do...have
some questions ...

Holding the pencil to his lips, he stands and leaves the drawing
behind, exiting FRAME.

Mallory looks at it.  A SKETCH of a man stabbing a woman.

CLOSE on Mickey as he crosses to GRACE.

CLOSE on GRACE'S eyes as they look downward.

CLOSE on JUDGE STEINSMA as he shuffles paper on his bench.

CLOSE on BISBING as her eyes follow Mickey across the court.

CLOSE again on Mickey studying Grace, the pencil pressed to his
lips in thought.

CLOSE on Grace as she pulls from a reserve of strength. Clenching
her hands, her eyes come up and lock hatefully on Mickey.

MICKEY
That's one helluva story, Miss Mulberry.

GRACE
Maybe to you.

Mickey paces in front of her, like a caged tiger.

MICKEY
Grace...I hope you don't mind if I call you Grace.

CAMERA dollies tighter on Grace.  Once locked onto her eyes, her
head drops forward and we:

FLASHBACK

INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT

ECU of GRACE'S eyes as her head is yanked back into frame.  The
CAMERA pulls back to reveal her eyes wide with fear, a gag in her
mouth and a knife pressed against her throat.  SOUNDS of
squealing murder victims in adjacent spaces. The night of the
murder.  A slaughter-fest of squealing TEENAGERS.

MALLORY'S got the knife to her neck.

MICKEY is wandering around, in a daze, in a black leather jacket
over a white t-shirt covered with blood.  Blood on his face, a
knife in his hand.  He turns to camera with the same deadcalm:

MICKEY (at the murdersite)
Grace...I hope you don't mind if I call you
Grace.

BACK TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

CLOSE on GRACE in a daze.

CLOSE on MICKEY smiling at her.

MICKEY
Grace?

Uh...yes.

MICKEY
I'd like to ask you about your murdered
brother...Tim?  His martial arts abilities?
How long had he been studying?

GRACE
Uh...he started when he was in the seventh
grade, so that would make it nine years.

MICKEY
And what was the color of Tim's belt?

GRACE
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't
believe in belts.

CLOSE on BISBING listening. Grace is doing better than she
thought.

MICKEY
Is that a fact?  Well, then, Grace could you
tell us what form of martial arts it was?

GRACE
It was Jeet Kune Do.

MICKEY

Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that
form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet
Kune Do was a style developed~by Bruce Lee.
Did you know that?

GRACE
Yes.  That why Tim studied it.  Because it was
Bruce Lee's fighting style.

CLOSE on the COURT CLERK'S HANDS typing.

MICKEY
Now, I think it would be safe to say that
anybody who studied the fighting style that
Bruce Lee developed -- arguably the greatest
fighter in the history of martial arts --
anybody who studies that for nine years, that
would be a fella who could defend himself.
Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

GRACE
Yes I would.

Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand.

MICKEY
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands and feet
considered weapons like guns or knives?  Am  I
correct on that point?

Grace's eyes on -- a CU of Mickey's HAND holding the pencil.

GRACE
Yes, you are.

CU of MALLORY listening.

MICKEY
Yet in your testimony just now, you described
that Tim...

CAMERA moves into a tight CU of Grace.  Her eyes widen.

MICKEY (O.S.)
...kicked me four times in the head.

FLASHBACK -- INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT

TIM, in a rage, cuts loose and hammers MICKEY with four punishing
kicks in the head!

BACK TO COURTROOM - CLOSE ON MICKEY

MICKEY
...and his trained Bruce Lee kicks had little
or no effect.

FLASHBACK - INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT

CAMERA is LOW ANGLE as TIM backs up after his attack.

We INSERT a High School class RING he wears on his right fist as
he steps into a fighting stance, ready for Mickey to drop.

MICKEY, however, spits out a stream of blood, and smiles at him.

BACK TO COURTROOM

CLOSE on GRACE.  We move down and see she is twisting the same
High School RING nervously in her hand.

CLOSE on MICKEY noticing the Ring and her attachinent to it.

MICKEY
Then, after shrugging off four blows to the
head like I was Superman, I lifted Tim-nine-
years-of Jeet-Kune-Do Mulberry off the ground
and threw him across the room.

Mickey, with arms raised over his head, pantomimes throwing Tim's
body.

FLASHBACK - INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT

WIDE SHOT as TIM flies into FRAME, CRASHING into the living room
wall.

BACK TO COURTROOM

We quickly PAN down a number of items with white evidence tags on
them.  We stop at Mickey's BUCK KNIFE.  Mickey's HAND comes into
FRAME and picks up the knife.

MICKEY
Then I took...

CU of MICKEY as he brings the knife into FRAME.

MICKEY
...this knife and proceeded to tear your
brother limb from limb.  And your brother,
whose hands are lethal weapons--

CLOSE on WANDA BISBING as she stands.

BISBING
Objection, defense is intimidating the witness
with the murder weapon.

JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.)
Sustained.  Mr. Knox, put the knife down.

Mickey is locked on Grace.

MICKEY (Cont'd)
--  had little to no defense.

GRACE (yelling)
I don't know how you did it, but you did it!

JUDGE STEINSMA
Mr. Knox!  The knife!

Mickey glances to the Judge, then slowly places the knife back on
the table.

MICKEY
How do you think a human being could possibly
be capable of doing something like that?

CLOSE on MALLORY watching.

GRACE (yelling)
I don't know!

Mickey locks eyes with Grace, moves very close.

MICKEY
Now...I don't believe that Grace.  I think you
have a definite opinion on how I was able to do
those things you described.  Now, I'm going to
ask you again.  And I want you to remember you
are under oath.

Grace collects herself.

MICKEY (O.S.)
In your opinion, Miss Mulberry, how was I able
to murder your brother Tim Mulberry in the
manner described?

Bisbing waits for the answer.

The Judge looks down at Grace.

Grace looks back into her open palm.  CU of the ring.

Mickey bearing down on her, waiting.

We DOLLY tighter on Grace as she looks up at Mickey timidly.

GRACE (softly)
You're not human.

Mickey smiles.

GRACE
I thought about it a lot.  And the only thing I
could figger' is you're not human...You're a
vampire, or the devil or a cyborg or something
like that.  But you're not human.

Grace breaks down.  Putting her hands to her head to stop the
pain.

Mickey rolls his pencil in his hand, then CAMERA tilts up as he
leans down into a CU, smiling at her.

MICKEY (softly)
Thank you.  Grace, there is one other thing...

GRACE (softly, into her lap)
What!...

Mickey smiles.

MICKEY
Do you believe in fate?

GRACE
What?  I don't know.

MICKEY
Well do you believe you have any choice when
it's time for you to die?

BISBING
Objection.  What does this have to do with
Grace Mulberry?

MICKEY
You know what this has to do with Grace
Mulberry?  I'll tell ya what it has to do with
Grace Mulberry.  It's her time!

Grace tearfully looks up and meets Mickey's demonic glare as he
plunges his PENCIL deep into her chest.  Grace's eyes go wide as
Mickey's vicious attack continues.

CAMERA whips to a CU of Bisbing jumping up screaming as
PANDEMONIUM breaks out in the courtroom in SLOW MOTION.

CU pencil puncturing Grace's blood-soaked chest.

CU Judge Steinsma slams his gavel, directing the Sheriff DEPUTIES
in SLOW MOTION.

CU of Mickey.  His attack is unending.

Grace goes limp.

As the Deputies reach Mickey from all sides, the pencil breaks

Mickey turning to the Judge.

MICKEY
No further questions your Honor.

Mickey's POV of a large DEPUTY stepping in front of him with a
riot club.

LARGE DEPUTY
Lights out prick!

Deputy swings the club.

CUT TO BLACK:

ACT THREE

EXT. PRISON - DAY

SUBTITLE READS:  "SUPERBOWL SUNDAY"

WAYNE unloads his cameras with CREW and VANS.  A major mobile
setup, yards of cable, lights.

INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

MICKEY'S pacing back and forth in his cell, talking to himself in
the mirrors, over the washbasin.

MICKEY
...You know.  'I'm gonna just rip off your dress
and squeeze your titties.' Then Little Red Riding
Hood whips out her .357, sticks it in the Big Bad
Wolf's face and says, 'No, you're not.  You're
gonna eat me...just like the story says.'

LAUGH SOUNDTRACK -- the sitcom running in his head.

JUMP TO:

MICKEY
...and the Polish guy says, 'That's nothing.
When I get through with my Hanna, I get up, wipe
my dick on the curtain, and she hits the roof!'

LAUGH SOUNDTRACK

JUMP TO:

Mickey's pretending he's calming down a hysterical audience.

MICKEY
No...please...thank you...you're too
kind...no...please...

KAVANAUGH opens the cell door.

MICKEY (hands in the air)
How ya doin' today Kavanaugh?

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

WARDEN McCLUSKY strides through his kingdom, trailed by SCAGNETTI
-- in a foul mood of indigestion and nausea. WURLITZER follows.

SCAGNETTI
How the hell did you let it go "live" Dwight --
for chrisake!!

MCCLUSKY
I couldn't stop it, it just got out of hand.
It don't change a thing Jack! We're gonna move
the scumbags tomorrow morning -- a little ahead
of schedule, that's all.

SCAGNETTI
You know Dwight--when I do these two ratfucking
douchebags, I'm going right up there with Jack
Ruby. In the Hall of Fame. I'll be world famous.

MCCLUSKY
You'll be bigger, Jack -- Oswald was a pussy...
(cocking his ear) Do you hear it, Jack?

SCAGNETTI
Oswald might've been a pussy but he was a great
shot (listens)...yeah, it's...

MCCLUSKY
...dead quiet.

Now we notice it.  Like the vacuum before the storm.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

McCLUSKY and SCAGNETTI enter, past the TECHNICIANS setting up two
cameras, lights, cable; ASSISTANTS, GUARDS all over the room.

WAYNE is checking his makeup and stubble in a mirror with a
MAKEUP PERSON as he walks and talks with his cameraman, ROGER.

WAYNE
Then maybe take him to the window, Rog...
(pretending the cameraman is Mickey)
So, Mickey, 'if you were let outta jail today,
what's the first thing you'd do?'
(pause)
Little shit like that.  I don't wanna have to
feel I gotta stay in the chairs.  We're after a
cinema verite, anything can happen, truth-
twenty-four-times a second kinda feel...Hi
Dwight.  How goes?  Can I just have a little
word?

He takes the WARDEN aside; Scagnetti dropping back.

SCAGNETTI
So Dwight, I'm gonna catch myself a little word
With Mallory.  The air in here's...y'know, a
little phoney for my taste.

Scagnetti exits.

WAYNE (to Scagnetti)
Yeah, you do that Jack.  Nice suit.
(to Warden)
Now Dwight, I don't know if you've ever been on
a set before --

MCCLUSKY (proud)
Ya know, I was. I was...

WAYNE (acting surprised)
Really?

MCCLUSKY
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about 8
years ago.  I knew this guy who...

WAYNE
Well...small world. Well then you know how it
works.  What we're about in this talk business
is intimacy, Dwight.  We're about two people
having a conversation.  I want a trust to
develop.  If you're thinking about all this...
(indicating the bustle of the room)
you're not going to relax, we'll be talking
at each other instead of "to" each other...
(pauses, Dwight waits; Wayne switches gears)
Which brings me to ... what I wanted to talk to you
about...I have to get Mickey Knox to relax-- to
share what he's never shared before. How Dwight
can we expect him to do that when we got more
deputies per cubic inch looking up his asshole
with shotguns than he has photosynthetic spores?

MCCLUSKY (turning on Wayne, short)
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to
do, Wayne?

WAYNE
Lose 'em.  Leave 'em outside.  I'm getting rid
of my crew.  Just me, the cameraman, the
soundman, that's it.  Intimate.  Dark.
Shadows.  Truth.

MCCLUSKY
Wayne, do you have the slightest idea how
dangerous Knox is?

WAYNE
Dwight, I assure you I am very familiar with
Mickey's career.

MCCLUSKY
Since he and his wife have been in custody,
they've killed --

WAYNE
I'm sure I know the facts as well as you do
Dwight.

MCCLUSKY
Well lemme clue you in on one fact you don't
know.  If I take my men out, Mickey Knox is
gonna snap your pencil fuckin' neck like a
fuckin' twig.

WAYNE (sensitive)
Dwayne...Dwight...One--fuckin' I grew up in a
very tough neighborhood in Sydney, and I've
handled some pretty rough customers in my day.
Mickey Knox don't scare me.

MCCLUSKY
You're a dreamer, son...you're a dreamer.

WAYNE
Two--I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take
that risk. Grenada, Panama; I was dodging 'scuds
in Baghdad, Dwight. Three--it ain't gonna happen.
Believe me when I tell you, it's in Mickey Knox's
best interest to play this game according to
Hoyle. (pause) Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
We've gotten into an adversary relationship here,
which is not what I want...

MCCLUSKY
No!

WAYNE
Seriously Dwight, look at this...
(counting the DEPUTIES in the room)
Six...seven.. eight.  Jesus Christ Duane, they
hate him.  He hates them.  We got hate in the
air.  Even you and I feel it.  I gotta explore
Mickey.  Columbus didn't know he was looking
for America. He was looking for India.  He
needed to be left alone, trusted, he...

MCCLUSKY
What in the goddamn hell are you talking about?

WAYNE
Two guys?

MCCLUSKY
Okay.  I'll take two guys off.

WAYNE
No, no, no, no. I mean only two guys.

MCCLUSKY
I can't do that.  Five guys.

WAYNE
Three.

MCCLUSKY
I'll cut it in half.  Four guys, but that's it.

INT. RECREATION ROOM - PRISON - DAY

Elsewhere in the prison, the boring SUPERBOWL winds down with the
Quarterback dropping to his knees, running out the clock and
"timeouts" being taken.

A LARGE CROWD of silent PRISONERS is gathered as the "AMERICAN
MANIACS" PROMO comes on:

INSERT TELEVISION FOOTAGE -- LOGO

A SHOTGUN GRAPHIC explodes through the screen and reveals file
footage of MICKEY and MALLORY, supering to WAYNE GALE waiting,
standby, "live."

TV ANNOUNCER
Right after the "Game," stay tuned for a special
"American Maniacs" on W-A-T-C-H. Mickey Knox is
the most dangerous man in America, but Wayne Gale
isn't afraid to meet him one on one to learn what
48 people died for: is this man insane or does he
belong where he sent so many others: in the
grave? Be sure to stay tuned for...

The SCREEN of the TV EXPLODES as something heavy (a machine tool
wrench) is thrown through it.  We hear an INMATE:

INMATE
Mother fucker!

The INMATES are throwing whatever they can now at the TV as the
WHISTLE goes and the GUARDS rush in with sticks.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

TV INSERT -- LOGO for "AMERICAN MANIACS" rolls to loud cue-in
MUSIC and ANNOUNCER.

TV ANNOUNCER
...and now Wayne Gale goes one to one with
Mickey Knox.  Straight from Batongaville
Penitentiary -- on the eve of Mickey Knox's
lobotomy.  Is he or isn't he?  Let America be
the Judge...

CUT TO:

MICKEY'S face -- in a chair, real calm, no handcuffs, a pleasant
smile.

MICKEY (TO THE GUARD)
How ya doin' today?

Across from him is WAYNE, with a serious intensity, half-glasses,
consulting his yellow legal pad notes, Mike Wallace-style.

WAYNE TV
Mickey Knox.  Thank you for this time.  I have
a few questions I'd like to start with, do you
mind?

MICKEY TV (smiles)
Let's roll the fuckin' (BLEEP) dice, Wayne.

WAYNE TV
Mickey Knox, when did you first start thinking
about killing?

CAMERA now in the room, rolling off Wayne to reveal Mickey and the
setup. It's made to look like a one on one but we now see
McClusky's DEPUTIES, among them WURLITZER and KAVANAUGH, are quite
close, just out of camera range. Mickey is cool as a feather.

MICKEY
Birth... I was thrown into a flaming pit of
scum...forgotten by God (laughs).

WAYNE
What do you mean by that?

MICKEY
What do I mean?...I mean I came from
violence... it was in my blood.  My Dad had it.
(chuckles)
You know.  Eat, Shit, Fuck, Kill, Die... it was
all my fate...my fate.

INSERT TV MONITOR -- the words are BLEEPED immediately.

Wayne's excited, Mickey's rolling right out the gate.

WAYNE
No one is born evil Mickey, it's something you
learn...Let's talk about your father? How he was
murdered? You were 10 years old when he died is that...

Mickey's mood immediately changes, darkens.

MICKEY TV
I didn't kill my father...and I don't want to
talk about that shit...

He throws a box of donuts at the camera.

JULIE signals excitedly from the monitor - a head set sending
messages to her.  More people turning on.  Thumbs up to WAYNE,
excited.

MICKEY
Please.

WAYNE TV

OK OK Mickey, let's go on to something else. I
understand Mickey Knox is reading the Bible these
days?

MICKEY
Ya?

WAYNE
The teachings of the Bible seem inconsistent
with your actions -- Christian values.

MICKEY
I don't know why.  The Bible's full of killings.

WAYNE
But what about God, does he have the right to
judge you?

Wayne's eyes scooting everywhere, motioning to McClusky to get
his men out of the background when Mickey's on camera.

MICKEY
God created me...if what I did was so bad why
didn't he stop me...why didn't he protect me
when I was a kid...He's doing it, not me.

WAYNE
Mickey, how can you look at an ordinary
innocent person...a guy with kids...and shoot
him to death... how can you do that?

MICKEY
Innocent?  Who's innocent Wayne?...it's just
murder man.  Everyone does it, all God's
creatures ...in one form or another...I know a
lotta people deserve to die...
(a look at McClusky who is impervious)

WAYNE
Why do they deserve to die?

MICKEY
Everybody got somethin' in their past, some
guilt, some sin, some awful secret thing...I
think people who deserve to die are those
people who are not living in the first place.
I think there's a lotta people walkin' round
right now who are aiready dead and need to be
put outta their misery.

WAYNE
...sort of "everyone meets their serial killer
half way"?  Is that what you're saying?. The
theory that the Jews wanted to be victims
walking into the gas chambers at Auschwitz;
that even genocide at some level's agreed
upon...?

MICKEY
The wolf don't know why he's a wolf, and a deer
don't know why he's a deer...God just made it
that way...

WAYNE
...You're talking now about "predators" Mickey.
You're saying the world itself is predatory.
When a mountain lion takes down an elk, it's
because it's the elk's time to go, and all the
b.s. liberal agenda about saving the animal
herds only overpopulates the balance of nature?
Maybe you're right Mickey Knox, maybe you're
right....  Corporate
predators.  Enviromental predators.  Nuclear
predators. Life is a hunt.  I've seen it
Mickey.  I was there.  When the shit (BLEEP)
hit the fan.  At Grenada.  I saw it all go down
at Grenada...

Mickey bored.  Julie signalling frantically to Wayne to cut the
jab.  Wayne sees the signal,

WAYNE
...so tell me Mickey, any regrets?  Three
weeks. 47 people, not cool.

MICKEY (corrects)
...48. Ya, I'm sorry I got Mallory into this
mess.  Prison and all.  She doesn't really
deserve it.

WAYNE
Anything else?

MICKEY
I'm sorry the Indian got killed.

WAYNE (consulting his notes)
The next to last victim.  The one whose
grandson testified at the trial that his
grandfather was trying to help you...

MICKEY
He saw it...

WAYNE
He saw what?

MICKEY
The Demon...He saw the Demon.

Mickey is deep into the memory.  Wayne's puzzled.

WAYNE
So what happened?

MICKEY
The whole deal was a mistake. I didn't mean to
kill him...The old man was trying to help us...

WAYNE
So what happened?
(fiercely, aside, to McClusky)
Dwight, will you get those two assholes outta
there!  It's supposed to look like me and
Mickey alone!

MCCLUSKY (aside)
Don't call my men assholes.

WAYNE (aside)
Shhh! I didn't mean they were assholes.  I mean
"get 'em outta here!"

McClusky signalling to Kavanaugh and Wurlitzer to step back.

Julie signalling fiercely for quiet.

WAYNE (to himself, re: McClusky)
Asshole.

MICKEY (meanwhile deep into it)
...there was a fight in my dream, see...it's
the same dream I've had since I was a
kid...it's hard to move...like I'm made of
lead...I taste metal in my mouth...Then...the
Demon comes after me.

WAYNE
What does it want...your soul?
(no answer)
What does it do?

MICKEY
It kills in this case something good.

WAYNE
So as long as you're bad...it won't kill you.

MICKEY (somewhere else)
...after the old man, we were gonna stop
killin'.  The old man took it out of us.

WAYNE
...but you both've killed on the inside?

MICKEY
The Demon lives in here.  Everyone's got the
demon.  It feeds on their hate, it cuts, rapes,
kills...it's the alien man, it uses your
weakness, your fear...only the vicious survive.

WAYNE (skeptical)
So that's why you're reading the Bible, you're
looking for help?  Hard to believe, Mickey.

MICKEY
You mean if Jesus could raise Lazarus from the
dead maybe he could help me?...No dice. (pause)
You know the only thing that kills the Demon?
...Love.  That's why I know Mallory is my
salvation.  She was teaching me how to love.
It's like being in the Garden of Eden...

WAYNE
"Only love can kill the demon." Hold that thought.

COMMERCIAL MUSIC cues in. Pause for a BREAK.

CUT TO:

INT. MALLORY CORRIDOR - DAY

The silence is vast...As SCAGNETTI'S feet go past, drawn
inexorably to her cell.  TWO GUARDS accompany him.

INT. MALLORY CELL - DAY

DOORS open -- SCAGNETTI'S POV marching in.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
Rise and shine Mallory!

MALLORY, asleep on the bunk, springs into a fighting stance.  If
you've seen a panther in a zoo, you understand the attitude
Mallory brings with her everywhere she goes.

CAMERA whips back to Scagnetti and the TWO GUARDS -- with
shotguns trained on her.

GUARD
Turn around and face the wall!

SCAGNETTI (approaching her)
That's all right fellows, we want to have a
little talk is all...

Pulls a chair out, indicates for her to sit.  She doesn't.

GUARD (nervous)
Mr. Scagnetti, don't get close to her.  She'll
kill you!...One way or the other, she'll kill ya!

Scagnetti ushers them to the door.

SCAGNETTI
Relax fellows, read my book.  Now I met some
women were really crocodiles in my time but
this little lady--I think she's gotta sweet
streak for me.

Scagnetti pulls his gun out and gives it to the Guard, pushing
the door closed on him.

GUARD
Sir, we're not allowed...

Scagnetti closes the door on them.  Alone with Mallory.

SCAGNETTI
Smoke?  (she stares)
I know you smoke.

A look of steel.  He gets closer, gentle.

SCAGNETTI
You know I'm not here to hurt you, Mallory. I
wanna be your friend. And if I ever met a girl
who needs a friend, it's you. You're a very
pretty girl...but I'm sure people tell you that
all the time.

Mallory doesn't respond.  Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
mouth, puts it between Mallory's lips.  She smokes.

Scagnetti relaxes.  Step one.  Hold on a C.U. of Mallory.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
I was reading the file on you.  You know what
it said?  It said during your trial, whenever
they put you on the stand, no matter what they
asked, your answer was always the same... "I
love Mickey."  It also says that when they gave
you a polygraph "I love Mickey" was the only
thing you said that registered as the truth ...

Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

SCAGNETTI
Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky Fromme?  Is
Mickey your Charles Manson? Or does he just got
a big dick?  That's it, isn't it?  Mickey's got
a big donkey dick. But you ain't seen mine. You
never been fucked by the real Prince Charming.

Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.  He's playing with a
cobra here, and he knows it.  It turns him on, deeper into his
sexual obsession with murder.

SCAGNETTI (pressing close)
Can you remember the last time you fucked? Huh?
What I want you to do is close your eyes
and remember...remember the last time ol' Mickey
gave you the high hard one.  Are ya thinking about
it?  Good.  Remember it.  Don't ever forget it
cause it ain't never gonna happen again.  Cause
when they get through with all that electroshock
shit they got lined up for you two, Mick's dick
ain't gonna be worth shit.  Course you're not gonna
give a particular shit either.  Cause when the good
doctors get through givin' you the zap...you won't
know where the hell you are.  They'll just put you
on a window sill and water you every other day.

Mallory looks at him with steel, then yawns.  Drops the cigarette
on the floor

CU of cigarette hitting the floor in SLOW MOTION.  We can still
see the red, burning end.

CU of Mallory's bare foot rising off the floor in SLOW MOTION

CU at floor level of Mallory's foot coming down on top of the
cigarette, then grinding it out -- SLOW MOTION.

Scagnetti watches this, gulps.

INT. RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Where the television was first smashed; the tone has shifted from
insurrection to riot  Instead of subduing the PRISONERS, the
SEVEN GUARDS are now in full retreat, swinging nightsticks over
shield.  The Prisoners, all desperate angry men, attack them --
bring them down.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

The RIOT is spreading.  The MEN take one of the GUARDS and throw
him into a huge spinning WASHING MACHINE and slam the door on
him, watching him go round and round.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY                                    162

The interview winds down.  JULIE very pleased -- a big "thumbs
up" for WAYNE who gleams.  Dollar signs all over his brain.

WAYNE
You have ultravision Mickey...you see things
others don't. You see the shadows.  Tell us.
Describe Mallory, Wayne...I mean Mickey.

MICKEY
Describe Mallory?  Okay.  She's my wife, she's
pretty, she's got brown hair, two eyes, two
feet...

WAYNE
Don't play dumb with me Mickey.  You know what
I mean.  Describe Mallory.
(points to his head)
What's up there?
(points to his heart)
What's in here?

MICKEY
That's indescribable.

WAYNE
Well, riddle me this Batman.  How do you feel
about the fact that you're never gonna see
Mallory again?

MICKEY (smiles)
Says who?

WAYNE
Says the United States Government of America.

MICKEY (laughs)
When have they ever been right?

WAYNE (pressing)
Then was it really worth it?

MICKEY
Was what worth it?

WAYNE
Was massacring all those people worth being
separated from your wife for the rest of your
life?

MICKEY
Do you think up all these question or does it
come from some central casting for reporters?

WAYNE
No Mickey, I can't let you get away with
rhetoric.  Answer the question.  Was it worth
it?  You haven't seen, heard, or smelled
Mallory in a year?  Was it worth it?

MICKEY
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie?
Yeah, it was.

WAYNE
Excuse me, did you say an 'instant of purity'?
What was that instant of purity?  The bodies
you left behind?

MICKEY
That's only part of it.  I mean, its a big,
big part.  But it's only the chorus, it's not
the whole song.

WAYNE (passionately)
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the "purity"
that you couldn't live without in 48 people who
are no longer on this planet because
they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking
(BLEEP) pure about that? How do you do it!!

CAMERA ZOOMS in on a pore-catching CU of Mickey.  Pause.

ECU profile of DEPUTY WURLITZER on the intercom, hearing the news
of the riot for the first time.  His expression shows.  He
signals to MCCLUSKY who goes to the phone.

MICKEY (meanwhile)
You'll never understand.  Me and you, Wayne, we're
not even the same species.  I used to be you...then
I evolved.  From where you're standing, you're a
man.  From where I'm standing, you're an ape...I'm
here...I'm still evolving...and you, you're stuck
somewhere else man.  You're presenting a reflection
of yourself. You buy and sell the Fear. You say
why?  I say why not?

WAYNE (with Mike Wallace intensity)
Awright, Mickey...now let's cut the BS, let's
get real.  Why?  Why this "purity" you feel
about killing?  Why forchrissake, why!!!!

MICKEY (laughs)
...I guess...Wayne...you just gotta hold that
ol' shotgun in your hand and it all 'comes
clear to you like it was for me that first
time.  That's when I knew my one true calling
in life.

WAYNE
And what's that Mickey?

MICKEY (smiles)
Shit, I'm a natural born killer.

COMMERCIAL MUSIC plugs in.

WAYNE (ecstatic, to himself)
GREAT!! Oh fuckin' brilliant! DID YA GET THAT!

JULIE (sign language)
Through the roof!  The whole country was
watching.  I heard 80, 90 share!!!

WAYNE
Oh Jesus, we'll be famous...how can I top this!

McClusky freaking out on the phone.

MCCLUSKY
Where! For the love of Pete! Shitfire Leroy!
Okay...Okay.. Mobilize the men. I'm on my way.

Hangs up, to the room.

MCCLUSKY
CLOSE DOWN ALL THE CAMERAS!  We got a riot
going on in the Rec Room in B Wing.

WAYNE
Is this a joke?  Are we finished!  We're live
for chrisake.  We got another 10 minutes!  200
million Americans are...!!

MICKEY takes it all in.

MCCLUSKY
You sure as hell are finished!  They got guns,
hostages, explosives.  Close it down now!

WAYNE (disappointed as hell)
Then could we go with you and film it?
Dwight, forchrisake!  "Live!"

MCCLUSKY
You stay here and you shut up!  I got to see what
the hell's going on down there before I can let
you film anywhere, it all started cause of your
goddamn peckerhead show in the first place!

WAYNE
(following him out, trying to grab Roger)
But the world is watching Dwight -- you can
never get 'em back!  You'll be famous.  It's
history!  Dwight!

MCCLUSKY (to Kavanaugh and his men)
This asshole's still tryin' to tell me what I'm
gonna do in my jail.  Fuck him!  This
nanderfuck don't know what he's dealing with
here, but we do.  And he ain't gonna be
responsible, we are.  So keep your shotguns on,
your fingers on the triggers, and be ready to
fire at a moment's notice!  Phil, Frank you
come with me! Jim you stay here. Let's go!

McClusky, Wurlitzer and DEPUTIES 3, 4 exit--leaving THREE GUARDS
and Kavanaugh with the LIVE CREW...and Mickey who pops gum,
smiles...

INT. RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Pandemonium.  PRISONERS holding GUARDS hostage, working their way
out the ROOM, into a CORRIDOR.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

The PRISONERS storming the GUARD CONTROL CENTER.  SHOTGUN blasts
from the GUARDS kill SEVERAL MEN but they are so desperate they
get into the Tower anyway, piling over the bodies of their dead
comrades.

INT. CONTROL CENTER - DAY

The MEN ransack the keys, hitting the electric locks and controls
-- kicking open several NEW CORRIDORS at once. Men running in
all directions.

INT. MAIN TIER - DAY

TWO INMATES chase a SNITCH -- throw him off a railing.

INT. MAIN TIER - DAY

The "telegraph" hits the 5-Tier MAIN ROOM.  The MEN there start
to go crazy, running down from all levels, attacking the GUARD
TOWER in the center of the room.  SHOTGUN BLASTS are fired.

CAMERA TRACKING OUT -- the noise of a buffalo stampede grows
through the prison.  Madness is coming!

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Everyone's nervous, locked in, hearing the noise.  WAYNE stares,
dying to get out, be part of the action.

JULIE nervously eats donuts.

The THREE GUARDS shift nervously, shotguns ready, eyes looking
out.

MICKEY strolls a bit, smoking, in the middle of a stupid joke no
one really listens to, stretching.

MICKEY
...so the mother says to the sister 'Okay, you
can go to the drive-in movie with Bobby as long
as you take Little Johnny.'  The sister says
okay.  They go to the drive-in, they come back.
The Mother gets Little Johnny and says,  'Okay,
what happened?  Where did ya go?'  Johnny who
can't talk, goes...

Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
like he's driving.

MICKEY
Mother says, 'The drive-in movie.  What did
they do?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

MICKEY
'They kissed.  What else?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, squeezes imaginary breasts.  The guards
relax, listening.  It gets their minds off the outside riot.

MICKEY (surprised)
'He felt her up?  What else?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

MICKEY (dumbfounded)
'They took off their clothes?  What else?'

Mickey, as little Johnny, pantomimes a fucking motion.

MICKEY (angry)
'They did that!  What were you doing?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously jacks off.

MICKEY (as Mother)
'Little Johnny, NO!!!

Everybody in the room breaks up. As Mickey finishes the punchline
he steps in front of KAVANAUGH, laughing, and SLAMS his elbow in
his face. Kavanaugh staggers. Mickey grabs his shotgun, rips it
from his grasp, then bashes him in the face, swivelling to
confront:

The THREE other GUARDS reacting.

Mickey SHOOTS DEPUTY 1 in the chest, blowing him off his feet.
He flies across the room and lands in a thudding heap.

DEPUTY 2 raises his gun, fires.

Mickey fires simultaneously, dropping to a crouch.

Deputy 2 crumples into the wall, firing off another blast -- SLOW
MOTION.

The stray blast takes the SOUNDMAN right in the chest, blowing
him across his equipment.

Mickey takes a hit in the shoulder, spins, pumping the slide.

DEPUTY 3 fires, missing -- hitting one of the TWO VIDEO CAMERAS.
It cracks.

Wayne terrified, running for a corner.

ANOTHER CREWMEMBER, the boom guy, goes crashing down, hit,
screaming

CU of ceiling being blasted.

Mickey spinning on Deputy 3.

MICKEY
Drop it -- put the gun down.

Deputy 3 (DUNCAN HOMOLKA) is a tired and old guard, very scared.
He drops it.

MICKEY
Smart move ... open the chamber.  Empty the
shells!  Everyone raise your hands.

SEVERAL TECHNICIANS shoot up their hands.

HOMOLKA's shells hit the floor.

MICKEY
Wayne!  Where the fuck are you?

Wayne in the corner, cowering, thinks Mickey's gonna kill him.

MICKEY
Get up!  Get a camera.

WAYNE
Uh...uh...where's Scotty?

ROGER
He's dead.

MICKEY
... and unless you wanna play follow the leader,
shut up and do as you're told.
(to Homolka)
You...toss it.

Homolka tosses his shotgun over to Mickey.

MICKEY
Hands behind the head!

Mickey grabs the burly Kavanaugh, who's on his knees, by the
collar.

MICKEY
On your belly, Kavanaugh, the fun's just
beginning.

KAVANAUGH
You'll never get out of here, Knox.  You're
dreaming -- they'll mop you in a bucket.

The battered Kavanaugh glares back at him, drops down.  Mickey
bends over him and takes hold of his right hand.

MICKEY
I am the most dangerous man in the world,
Kavanaugh.

Mickey snaps the trigger finger on Kavanaugh's right hand.
Kavanaugh screams.

MICKEY
And when the most dangerous man in the world
tells you to do something, you oughta think
twice before refusing.

Mickey snaps the trigger finger on Kavanaugh's left hand.
Kavanaugh screams. ("Fuck you!")

MICKEY (points at him)
You're the law.
(points to himself)
I'm the law breaker.

Kavanaugh shuts up.

MICKEY (to Roger)
You...you got a camera?

ROGER
Uh, both cameras are shot to shit!

MICKEY
Too bad for you.

ROGER (quick change)
Uh uh we can get an image.  Got a video
shoulderpack!  Remote Beta.

MICKEY
Good.  Put it on your shoulder.  We're going
out.  All of us.  One big party.  Shoot
everything I do.  (pregnantly) Got it?

ROGER
You bet.

MICKEY
Wayne, tell your station we're going to resume
our broadcast "alive."  Make it happen Wayne.

WAYNE (with feigned enthusiasm)
No problem, chiefo, you got it!

As Wayne reaches for his cellular phone, Mickey notices something
in the back of his belt, under his loosened and frayed shirt.
Mickey reaches for it.

MICKEY
What the hell is this Wayne!

It's a 40 calibre Glock semi-automatic.  States of the art.  But
Wayne will not give it up so easy.  Quick as a wink, Wayne goes
for Mickey's wrist -- tries to put him into an aikido sweep-down
move -- accompanied by a fierce SHOUT.

WAYNE
Eeeeeeyaaahhhhhh!

Nothing happens.  Mickey just stands there, grins -- then smashes
Wayne in the face with a straight arm.

Wayne hits the floor, in GROANING pain.

Mickey brandishes Wayne's gun.

MICKEY
You're a naughty boy bringin' this in here,
Wayne.  What would the lawman say?

Turning his attention back to Kavanaugh, Mickey propells him out
the door.

MICKEY
Get me to Mallory -- and she better be in one
piece.

INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

SCAGNETTI
OK, spread um!...I'll show ya I'm the bad
motherfucker here!

MALLORY smiles and suddenly starts to dance.  Spreading her arms,
undulating her belly.  She's a natural born dancer.

SCAGNETTI watches her, fascinated, misunderstanding.  He peels
off his shirt.

SCAGNETTI (changing tone, intimate)
I know you... I saw what you did to that kid at
the gas station... I know what you like.

MALLORY
Yeah?...what do you think about...right now?

Mallory is weaving like a cobra around him, getting close but
never touching him, making him sweat. Pulling his pants down half
way, he takes her seat.

MALLORY
Tell me what you want...

Scagnetti is screaming with lust and murder.  His head revolving
360 degrees around the back of the chair to watch her.  He can't
help himself.  He's not thinking straight.  He's lost it.

She gets in his face, very close.  About to kiss him first with
her belly, then with her lips.

We even think she might be going along with him.  He's moving his
lips closer to hers.  She smiles -- that long slow orgasm of a
smile.

Then she nails him.  Smashing into his face with a headbutt.
Breaking his nose in an explosion of blood and pain.  Scagnetti
lets out a horrible SCREAM.  She tears into him.

EXT. MALLORY CELL - DAY

The TWO GUARDS fumble with the keys to open the cell door.

INT. MALLORY CELL - DAY

The TWO GUARDS burst through the door to find SCAGNETTI face down
on the ground.

MALLORY'S standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break his
back.  His body is bending like a branch, and he's screaming.

The TWO GUARDS are on top of her like tornadoes, beating the shit
out of her with their shotguns.

She slugs it out with them.  Is Scagnetti alive...   Barely
crawling on the floor, a crumpled wormlike moan escapes his lips.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

MICKEY at the helm of WAYNE, JULIE, TWO HOSTAGE DEPUTIES and a
party of FOUR TECHNICIANS hustles down a corridor of the prison
past SCREAMING INMATES flying in all directions.

INT. PRISON KITCHEN - DAY

A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a MOB
of other SHADOWS carrying nightsticks and bars.  Suddenly we are
out of shadows as:

The MOB catches the PRISON GUARD and stuffs him, mercilessly into
one of the LARGE OVENS, turning up the heat.  He SCREAMS
horribly, the sound carrying over:

INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - MAIN TIER - DAY

This SCENE is a TRAVELLING CU that never leaves MCCLUSKY --
trailed by WURLITZER and STAFF.  We can make out activity on the
edges of frame and we can vividly hear the sounds of chaos all
through the prison.

MCCLUSKY
Get two men up on that tier.  And I want men
with rifles all along the walkway.

WURLITZER
Capt'n

MCCLUSKY
Where do the air ducts lead?

SMITHY
Over there.  But they'll hear somebody
approaching thru 'em.

MCCLUSKY
Then turn the power back on.  The machines
supply us with the cover noise we need.
Smithy, get on it.

SMITHY
Right away Capt'n!

McClusky snatches the walkie talkie from him, talks into it.

MCCLUSKY
Bergman, you in place?

BERGMAN (O.S.)
Sure am, Capt'n.  Nothin' clean yet.

MCCLUSKY (into walkie talkie)
Pass this on to your teams...the second they
get a lock on a blue, they're to take the shot.
Do you understand?

BERGMAN (O.S.)
That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

MCCLUSKY
It's that or death, Bergman!  Do it!

CAMERA follow MCCLUSKY as he heads in another direction.

MCCLUSKY
Wurly, are the sharpshooters in place?

WURLITZER
Yeah.

MCCLUSKY
You sure?

WURLITZER
I think --

MCCLUSKY
Never say you think when you know, or you know
when you think...What do you think, Wurly?  How
many explosives do you think they have in there?

McClusky now reveals the MAIN TIER in utter pandemonium. He barks
out.

WURLITZER
It's hard to say Capt'n.

MCCLUSKY
Take a wild stab!

WURLITZER
I'd say enough to destroy this wing.

MCCLUSKY
The entire wing?

WURLITZER
That's my opinion.

MCCLUSKY
Jesus Harold Christ.  How'd I let this happen!  I
was too soft, Wurly...When I get my prison back,
there's gonna be hell to pay!

WURLITZER
There's gonna be hell to pay!

MCCLUSKY
Pure Hell!

ON TV:

SCREEN FILLS WITH STATIC

INSERT TITLE CARD:  "SPECIAL REPORT"

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
We interrupt this program to bring you a
Special Report.

INT. NEWS ROOM - DAY

Title Card recedes in frame to expose an active NEWS ROOM in the
BG.  News Anchor ANTONIA CHAVEZ is lowering herself behind a desk
while adjusting her earphones.

CHAVEZ TV
Good afternoon, I'm Antonia Chavez and this is
an W-A-T-C-H Special Report. (fingering earphone)
I'm being told that we're taking you right now
live to Batonga Penitentiary where Wayne Gale
continues his interrupted interview in the
middle of a full-scale riot.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - MALLORY WING - DAY

VIDEO FOOTAGE of WAYNE caught in MICKEY'S HOSTAGE TRAIN ~- is all
handheld and harshly lit.  Wayne's crouched, moving backwards,
trying to reassert control over the situation as well as his own
terror.  The relationship he has to his mike and the camera
certainly helps.

WAYNE (into camera)
This is Wayne Gale reporting live from Batonga
where you can tell by the blood and carnage all
around me that the final chapter in the book
called Mickey and Mallory has not yet been written.
An incredible war has broken out here in Batonga,
unlike anything I've ever seen!  Grenada.  The
Gulf...Batonga will stand alongside them as...

The CAMERA swings wildly on ROGER's shoulder to catch MICKEY
edging up to the exterior of MALLORY'S CELL -- about to break in.
CONVICTS screaming continue to run by CAMERA without direction
occasionally flitting to a stop to stare or to make a face in the
camera, chased off by Mickey's gun.

INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

SCAGNETTI is holding his bloody nose, screaming, blood all over
his face.

SCAGNETTI
She broke my fucking nose!  That bitch broke my nose!

He glares over at MALLORY who lies with the shit beaten out of
her in the corner.

GUARD 1 has his shotgun barrel placed in her mouth.

CU on Scagnetti.  He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled as he
walks over to her.

SCAGNETTI
Hold her!

He grabs a can of MACE from GUARD 2's belt and brings it up to
Mallory's face, as she's propped up by the Guards.

Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
eyes, and all over her body.

Mallory crumples to the floor, SCRAAMING in agony.

TWO SHOT of the Guards looking down at her.  We can hear
Scagnetti still SPRAYING her.  They can't look at this anymore.

Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti keeps spraying her.

CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling.

The DOOR whips open and MICKEY steps through aiming the shotgun.

MICKEY (to Mallory)
Honey I'm home!!

He blows GUARD 1 away.

CU of Mallory -- she hears it, but can't yet see.

GUARD 2 is whipping up his gun, FIRES a round as he is hit and
BLOWN across the room.

Right next to Mickey, TECHNICIAN 4 (we will work backwards as
they are eliminated) takes a hit in the gut.  Mickey spins to
confront:

The CAMERA dollying down to the "Scag" crouched over Mallory, his
gun pointed right at Mickey about to fire.

Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of
the room.

Nobody fires.

We DOLLY PAST the faces of both WAYNE and ROGER, inside the room
now, filming this LIVE.  They both hit the deck flat, as do the
OTHER HOSTAGES.

Just the Two Men.  The Showdown.

CU on Scagnetti's face

CU on Mickey's face

CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then
CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey.  CAMERA moves down in front of him into
a CU of his face.

MICKEY
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

SCAGNETTI (not backing down)
Slide the shotgun over here, asshole, put your
hands behind your head, your forehead on the floor

MICKEY
Or what?  You'll wound me?  I can blow you in
half Scagnetti an' ya know it.

SCAGNETTI
I've never wounded anything in my life.  I got
you locked right between the eyes, Knox. I've had
you locked from the "jump" you fuckin' phony.

MICKEY
If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin' you in
half on three.  So, if you got me locked, take
the shot. One...

DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in FG, past the gun, to his face
CU of barrel of shotgun.

MICKEY (O.S.)
Two...

SCAGNETTI
Come on! Shoot me! I was just fuckin' your
girlfriend. She came so hard she broke my nose.

DOLLY continues closing on Scagnetti's face

Wayne watches, beyond himself.  Television nirvana.

Roger filming

ECU on Mickey's face

MICKEY
Okay Scagnetti...you win.

Scagnetti is in pig heaven as MALLORY, reddened with mace, looms
up behind him with a prison fork clasped in her hand.  She yanks
Scagnetti back by the neck and drives the fork deep into his
throat.

ECU the back part of his head.  We hear the sickening sound of
the fork plunging into his throat.  His head jerks back
violently, farther into frame, still held by Mallory

ECU of Scagnetti as his face is racked with pain. He gurgles,
eyes bulging.

She lets him go, stands.

Wayne and his TV audience unbelieving.

She looks down at him.  Raises her foot and pitches him over onto
the floor, trembling, still alive.  He tries -- through the
remainder of the scene -- to get back up on his knees, the CAMERA
trembling from his POV on:

Mallory running into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing.  This
kiss has been a year coming.  Now they're doing something
everybody told them they would never do again.

WAYNE (on TV, getting into it)
This kiss has been a year coming.  They're doing
something everybody told them they would never do again.
At this moment they are the only two people on earth.

We are enraptured too. Roger's CAMERA does a 360 around the
loving couple.

MALLORY (inbetween kisses)
It's taken you so long to come to me.

Scagnetti from a FRONTAL ANGLE spoils the scene with his GURGLING
SOUNDS as he climbs to his knees. The two lovers look down at him.

Mickey, distracted, cracks open his shotgun, showing it to be
empty as he reloads it.

MICKEY (smiles)
Lost your touch Jack. You had me. Two shells.
Two guards.

Scagnetti realizing it.  His POV:

Mallory looms over him.

MALLORY
Get the picture, ya fuckin' squid?

She lifts her foot and sets it down on the CAMERA, covering the
FRAME.

CU of Scagnetti as his face is shoved down to the floor by
Mallory's foot.  She grinds her foot into his face.  Scagnetti
gives up the ghost in that position.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - MAIN ROOM - DAY

CU of MCCLUSKY'S SHOES cutting a mean path down the hallway.
CAMERA rising to his face.  A computer printout of several
hundred pages in his hands.

MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
What's this?

WURLITZER (O.S.)
A list of prisoners.

TILT UP to McClusky's face, exasperated.

MCCLUSKY
What the fuck do I need this for -- I asked for
a list of hostages.

WURLITZER
The hostages?  How'm I supposed to know.

MCCLUSKY
Just get it! What I gotta tell you everything!

WURLITZER
I'm working on it.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

MCCLUSKY turning into a GROUP of DEPUTIES clustered around the
VIDEO MONITORS

MCCLUSKY (urgent to Deputy)
What are those, gates? Try closin' 1-2-3 again.

GUARD (at controls)
They're still jammed open sir...(rapid fire)
We got fires in 5-6 north...the Psych unit
looks like a zoo.  They're slaughtering each
other.  All our informants are being tortured.

ON THE FIVE MONITORS:

MCCLUSKY sees mayhem:  Cons fighting cons, fires, yelling, water
flowing from broken toilets and sinks.  Cons are pounding out
steel mesh windows with pipes.  Rape and murder.  In the Psych
Unit:  violence, sexual perversion, people dancing, crying,
climbing.  Everyone feels the demon's arrival.

Even McClusky.

NAPALATONI (O.S.)
Capt'n!

McClusky glances at him, then back at the monitors.

MCCLUSKY
What is it, Napalatoni? (mispronounces name)

NAPALATONI (corrects name)
Mickey and Mallory Knox are loose.

McClusky looks, remembers.

MCCLUSKY
What do you mean they're loose?

NAPALATONI
They're armed, they got the Wayne Gale crew and
Kavanaugh and Homolka.  Scagnetti's dead.  They
got cameras and they're on TV right now!

McClusky holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his mind
has shut down.

MCCLUSKY
Jesus Harold Christ on a fuckin' crutch, is
this happening to me?

CUT TO:

INT. MALLORY CELL - DAY

DIOPTER SHOT - Wayne's personal phone rings loudly.  Everyone
looks at it.  Wayne slams it to his ear.

WAYNE
Yeah!

MICKEY uses the camera crew's gaffer tape to tie the HOSTAGES (3
TECHNICIANS, WAYNE, JULIE, KAVANAUGH and HOMOLKA) to each other,
in a train pattern. ROGER is given a short leash with camera.

MICKEY
What's your name?

HOMOLKA
Duncan...Duncan Homolka.

MICKEY
Okay, Duncan Homolka, step forward.  Keep
coming.  Put your solar plexus right against
Kavanaugh's butt... Grab his arms...

They squeeze together.  He wraps them.

MICKEY
We're gonna go through some heavy fire. We're
gonna march down the hall and right out the
building.

KAVANAUGH
You don't have a chance in hell. If they have
to kill us all they will.

MICKEY
Police psychology, Kavanaugh.  You know the way
I feel about cops, but you don't know how I
feel about my father.  So when you sound like
him, that makes me feel like hurting you...

A tense moment.

MALLORY
Come on Mickey -- we don't have time for this
shit.  I wanna get outta here before this
place blows up.

During this Wayne is pleading on the phone, guietly.  Mickey in
BG, tying the hostages, casts an amused glance.

WAYNE
...look honey, nothing happened, I swear! I've
been faithful...since that incident...I don't
know what you think you found.  Look we'll talk
about it when I get home...about two hours...is
Jimmy okay?...Of course I'm not okay...this is
worse than Baghdad...listen if I get through
this Delores, it's all straight sailing from
now on... I love you.

MICKEY (to Wayne)
Hey Romeo, you say something about a news van.

WAYNE (clicking the phone off)
Sure Mickey, we have a van.

MICKEY
Where's it parked?

WAYNE
Out front.

MICKEY
Let me have the keys.

Wayne point to JULIE, who digs through her pockets and tosses the
keys to Mickey.

MICKEY
How come you never talk?

ROGER (the cameraman)
She was born without a tongue.

MICKEY (repulsed)
Oh my God!  (to Julie)  Sorry.

Julie shrugs her shoulders like "what're ya gonna do" as Mallory
tapes her up.

Wayne approaches Mickey like he is insane and has to be handled
gently.

WAYNE
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

MICKEY (taping a hostage)
No.

WAYNE
This is crazy.  You can't escape like this.

MICKEY
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old
college try.

WAYNE
We'll all be killed!

MICKEY
Exciting, isn't it?

Duncan Homolka starts to cry.  Wayne's cellular phone RINGS again
in his pocket.  Everyone stares.

WAYNE (interrupted)
SHIT! No one has this number!
(slamming the receiver to his ear)

MICKEY (continuing to the others)
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say
or it's shotgun city.  If we say move, you
move.  If we say left, you move left.  If we
say right, you move right.  If we say mole, you
dig a hole.  Got it?

During this, Wayne pleads on the phone with 'the other one.'

WAYNE
...She called you???...Oh shit! She doesn't
mean that...Mai Ly, it's not "either-or,"
that's bullshit...It's not evidence...Mai Ly I
can't talk to you like this...look I'll be
there as soon as I can...Two, maybe three
hours, we'll settle this, I promise...I
promise...what do you mean 'is this real?'  Do
you think this is a show?  They're dead people
here, honey.  I gotta go!

MICKEY
Wayne! Wagons, hoooaaa!

The hostage train moves out!  Roger hauling the video camera.
Mallory grabs Wayne around the neck and jams her pistol up to his
head as he pockets the cellular phone.

MALLORY
Let's go.  Tongue in two faces.

INT. MAIN TIER - DAY

CAMERA flies down CONVICTS running.  They hang a GUARD off the
railing by his neck.  He dangles there.

INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

CONVICTS are cutting the throats of the SNITCHES in the barber
chairs.  Smoke is pouring out everywhere.

INT. MAIN TIER - DAY

TEARGAS is fired at the CONVICTS as the GUARDS rush the 5-story
MAIN TIER, retaking it.

A CONVICT FIRES a teargas grenade right into the head of ANOTHER
CONVICT.

Out of this morass of smoke and gas, MICKEY and MALLORY lead
their CARAVAN, blasting both GUARDS and CONVICTS who try to
attack them.

CAMERA MOVES with them through smoke, flame, gas, dying bodies --
as if it were a process shot behind them.  There is no stopping
Mickey and Mallory.

TECHNICIAN 3 and TECHNICIAN 2 go down, dead, wounded, dropping
out of the caravan.

KAVANAUGH is wounded

JULIE is wounded, but can't yell out. It's sad

ROGER'S VIDEO captures it all.  The FOOTAGE we see through his
camera is very similar to Vietnam footage.  It's shaky, real
harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

The soundtrack is a mad mixture of yelling, crying, laughing and
gunfire.

MORE DEPUTIES appear, tracking them.

The wild CARAVAN runs in the other direction, FIRING behind them.
TECHNICIAN 1 goes down and Mickey's HIT in the leg, but keeps on
running and FIRING. Mallory sees this and screams.

MALLORY
Mickey!

MICKEY
Don't stop.

Roger's CAMERA right alongside them.

ROGER
Man, oh man!...this is better than Vietnam!

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MAIN TIER - DAY

MORE DEPUTIES appear at the other end of the HALLWAY, catching
Mickey and his crew in a treacherous CROSSFIRE.

Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using their
SHIELDS firing from the rear and the front.

DUNCAN (hysterical)
Please don't kill me! Don't kill me!

Wayne's hit in the ass and ear. Anger in his face. ("Fuck! Fuck!")

Julie is killed, geysering blood all over Mickey and Mallory.

Roger's camera WHIP PANS from that to catch a DEPUTY hopping
around the corner.  The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

Roger's HIT, and the VIDEO CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
control, then THUNKING to the ground.  Roger screams O.S.

CAMERA lies on the floor, video still recording. Roger rolls into
FRAME screaming.

MICKEY
Get the camera!  Get the fucking camera!

Wayne, angry beyond his character, reaches down inside himself
and grabs the gun off a dead Deputy -- and fires a blast at an
oncoming DEPUTY who drops.  He fires at another, and another!

WAYNE
YOU BASTARDS! YOU FUCKSHITEATIN BLOODY BASTARDS!!

As Mallory swipes the camera from the dying Roger

Mickey firing cover for her, sees Wayne has gone nuts.

Kavanaugh is hit again, looks like he's dying.  It looks bad for
the hometeam, but suddenly:

OWEN is there.  A mild looking man in convict's uniform, calm,
emotionless, with his thinning hair he could pass for an
accountant.  In one arm is a 12-gauge.  On his other arm is a gas
grenade launcher.

He's blasting down the approaching DEPUTIES, letting gas grenades
blur the corridor.

The Deputies scatter.

Through the smoke, Owen looks down at Mickey.

OWEN
Come on.  This way!

The Knox's jump up and holding Duncan and propping Kavanaugh,
with Wayne tailing, they run down a NEW CORRIDOR that Owen leads
them to.

Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
and silent.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

On the run:

MICKEY
Who the fuck are you?

OWEN
I'm Owen.

MICKEY
What do you want from us?

OWEN
I want you to take me with you.

MICKEY
Right now we're not goin' fuck anywhere.

OWEN (smiles enigmatically)
Follow me!

Turns into a stairwell.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

MICKEY
Where does this go?

OWEN
To the front entrance.  The ground floor.

A look between MICKEY and MALLORY.  They can smell it -- Freedom!

DUNCAN is hyper-ventilating against the wall.  KAVANAUGH looks
like he's dead.

WAYNE is pumped, yelling.

WAYNE
It was great!  It was fuckin' great!

Mickey patches his shoulder up.

MICKEY
I'm proud of ya! (gives him a high five) got
the feeling now??

WAYNE
I'm alive! For the first fucking time I'm alive! Thank
you Mickey. Let's kill all these motherfuckers!

Mallory takes the gun away from him, gives him the video.

WAYNE
No! No!

MALLORY
Sorry Wayne, you're not centered. You keep
shooting with that.

MICKEY (grabbing Kavanaugh)
Let's go!!!

They tear down the STAIRS.  Two flights.  Freezing as:

INT. LOWER STAIRWELL

MCCLUSKY stands at the bottom of the stairwell, surrounded by a
TEAM OF DEPUTIES, their guns pointed right at MICKEY and the
Caravan.

MCCLUSKY
End of the line, Knox.  Drop 'em!

Mickey grabs KAVANAUGH, props him.  HOMOLKA tries to make a run
for it but MALLORY grabs him. OWEN has suddenly vanished.

McClusky's POV -- Kavanaugh dies right then and there.

MCCLUSKY
He's dead, dickweed! You got shit, asshole! Fire!

Several shots are fired.  Mickey discards Kavanaugh and grabs for
Homolka.  But Mallory is faster, grabbing Wayne and propelling
herself in front of Mickey on the narrow stairs.

MALLORY
Back off ya squids or I'll blast him!  Back off
or I'll blast him!

None of the Deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
likely to start shooting.

WAYNE (begs)
Don't shoot! I beg you, don't shoot! Please,
please, please.

MCCLUSKY (steps forward)
Shut up Gale!  Ya prick! Now Mickey, Mallory,
just let me say --

MALLORY
You shut up!  I don't wanna hear it.

MCCLUSKY
I'm sure you realize Mallory if you kill this
prick, you...

MALLORY (jerks Wayne)
Put your hand up!!

Wayne automatically sticks his right hand up

Mallory SHOOTS a hole in it. Wayne SCREAMS bloody murder. The
deputies jump back.

MALLORY
...I said SHUT UP!

McClusky shuts up.  There's a silent standoff.

Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the Caravan retreats
back up the stairs to the next flight.

Owen runs up again out of nowhere, mysterious.

OWEN
I made a path!

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON SHOWER - DAY

OWEN leads into a SHOWER--dead people everywhere, water gushing
from the broken showers. MICKEY wonders, with a look at Owen, who
did this.

DUNCAN is out and out hysterical, urine stains on the front of
his uniform

WAYNE furious at MALLORY, staunching the blood from his hand with
a piece of his shirt.

WAYNE
Goddamit what the hell's wrong with you!  I was
beggin for you guys.

Mickey's pacing, ignoring his wound.

MICKEY
Think...think...think.

Wayne's cellular phone RINGS once more. Exasperated he grabs it
with his bloody hand.

WAYNE
YEAH...

Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her hand.
Blood trickles out between her fingers. We now see she's been
shot.

Over Duncan's impassioned clamor they hear McClusky YELLING
up the stairwell.

MCCLUSKY
Sixty seconds and I'm coming up!

INT. LOWER STAIRWELL - DAY

WURLITZER
Dwight, forchrissake!  The fuckin' zoo's
explodin' and you're didlin' with these two
pukes, we got more imp...

MCCLUSKY (grabs and shakes Wurlitzer)
These TWO.  These are the ones. They are gonna
die today!  You hear me, Wurly -- I'm gonna
wipe this scum off the face of the earth if
it's the last fucking thing I do.

INT. PRISON SHOWER - DAY

MICKEY ties off a tourniquet on his arm, next to MALLORY,
totally exhausted.  Both of them shot, in pain.  He puts his arm
around her.

WAYNE is yelling over the dying cellular battery:

WAYNE
Blow it off bitch!  You hear me...I ain't never
comin' home.  I'm free of you.  I'm alive!  For
the first fucking time I'm ALIVE.  So guess what
-- You Piss Right Off!

He cuts off and presses "recall" on another number.

OWEN sidles up to Wayne.

OWEN
You're the greatest, Mr. Gale...you've done a
lot for people.

WAYNE
That's okay mate, thanks a lot.

"Mai Ly" comes on the line.

WAYNE
I finally done it.  I left my wife!

MICKEY (to Mallory)
You done good Mall!  Whatever happens, know I
love you...know I loved you more'n I ever loved
myself...

MALLORY (tender)
I know...(then) We're not getting outta here,
Mick! So, I say the hell with going back to our
cells. Let's do a Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid.  Run down these stairs shootin',
go out in a hail of bullets, an' take as many
of these motherfuckers with us as we can.

Lovey, dovey now, they touch and feel each other. Mickey cries,
then laughs.

MICKEY
That's poetry...but we'll do that when all else
fails.

He has a plan, his exhaustion lifting.  He stands, confronts the
hysterical DUNCAN HOMOLKA.

MICKEY
You married?

DUNCAN
Oh I don't wanna die!

MICKEY
Are you married?  Do you have kids?

Duncan nods pathetically.

MICKEY
Good.

Mickey squats in front of Wayne who finishes his call.

WAYNE (on phone)
Mai Ly, we're gonna fuck all night scuba
fuckin' doo!!

Mickey takes a roll of gaffers' tape from his shirt, sticks
strips of them to the wall.

MICKEY (to all)
...the only way we're gonna get all the way to
the front door is if they don't want to kill
you two more than they want to kill me.
(to Wayne)
On your knees, journalist --
(Wayne complies)
Now, say I tell those guys down there if they
shoot or make a move, I'm killing Wayne Gale.
And they shoot or make a move anyway.  Now say
by some freak accident, you don't die, you
live through it.  What would you do?

While Wayne speaks, Mickey props his shotgun under Wayne's chin
and wraps the gaffer tape around the barrel of the shotgun.  Then
he wraps it around Wayne's neck.

WAYNE (going with it)
What would I do?  Me and my Network would sue
the entire Sheriffs Department and Prison
Administration for flagrantly disregarding my
safety.  I would go straight to my buddy, the
Governor, I'd go to "Bill" himself, I'm a
friend of Bill's, I'd go to Mike at 60 Minutes,
I'd expose myself, I'd make sure everyone of
these sons of bitches down there ends up on the
unemployment line.  In fact I'd sue every man
down there personally.

Mickey tosses the tape roll to OWEN and Mallory and gestures to
Duncan.

WAYNE (Cont'd)
...I would make it my life's ambition to bring
Dwight McClusky and the entire prison system to
its knees.  I would do expose after expose on the
brutality and the conditions and the inhumanity
that exists here. Just take me with you!

Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the stock
of the shotgun.

MICKEY
Calm down Wayne. That's what I thought. And
how many people watch "American Maniacs"?

WAYNE
On average forty million.

MICKEY
'Every week by forty million people'!  Have you
won any awards?

WAYNE
Are you kidding?  The Golden Globe.  The Edward
R. Murrow Award...Working on a Pulitzer.

Owen and Mallory are taping Duncan similarly.

Mickey grabs the video camera and lifts it to his shoulder.

MICKEY
'Respected journalist' -- you wanted reality?
You got it.

He pushes Wayne down the stairwell.

INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

MCCLUSKY waits with his DEPUTIES.

Empty FRAME on STAIRWELL

VOICE OF WAYNE
My name is Wayne Gale!  I am the star of
'American Maniacs.'

WAYNE comes into view, camera in his hands -- filming himself.
MICKEY'S right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Wayne's neck.

WAYNE (Cont'd)
...watched by 40 million people every week!  I
am a respected journalist, winner of the Edward
R. Murrow Award among others!

McClusky freezes, not knowing what to do except throttle Mickey
with his bare hands, which he would do if WURLITZER were not
holding him back.

His Deputies pause, hesitating, as they realize if they take out
either MICKEY or MALLORY, that Wayne or DUNCAN would die.

NOTE:  The scene's intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE and color 35 mm.

WAYNE (Cont'd)
You are on camera.  We are Live (the camera
barely turning).  If anybody puts me in danger,
my network will sue Dwight McClusky and the
entire Sheriff's Department and the Governor
himself.  My estate will sue every officer
personally who fires.  The network's law firm
is Sinclair, Marshall, and Milchan.

OWEN whips his gun left and right in clownlike loops like Harpo
Marx, smiling. DUNCAN HOMOLKA simply cries and begs for his life
to be spared.

DUNCAN HOMOLKA (indecipherable)
PPPleeezzeee dddooonn'tt killl meeee!

But Mickey knows what he's doing.  This has an effect on the
Deputies.

MALLORY (yelling)
Make a path!

The wall of Deputies starts moving backwards.

INT. FINAL CORRIDOR - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

It has become a dance.  The CARAVAN on one side taped to the mast
of their ship, moving as if under one tent -- MICKEY, DUNCAN,
MALLORY, WAYNE, OWEN and their guns and eyes...

Across from them a PHALANX of GUNS and LAWMEN -- moving in
syncopated unison, a parallel track out the STAIRWELL into the
FINAL CORRIDOR approaching the RECEPTION AREA to the prison.
Freedom!

Wayne keeps yelling, Duncan blubbering; the Deputies keep their
guns trained but they give ground -- parting like the Red Sea.

Mickey's eyes see ut.

So do Mallory's.  They share a look.

OUTSIDE.  Birds.  Trees.  No bars.  CAMERA moving on it.  Coming
to MCCLUSKY who stands his ground at the door.

MCCLUSKY
How far do you think you're gonna get?

MICKEY
Right out the front door.

MCCLUSKY
That'll never happen.

MICKEY
It is happening.

The Caravan marches forth.  Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
mantras.  Nobody dare to move on them.

Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

MALLORY
Don't stop!

Wayne starts up again.

The Deputies are completely frustrated.  Mickey and McClusky are
nose to nose.

MCCLUSKY (to Mickey)
I will personally hunt you down, blow the head
off your fucking-whore-wife, and plant your
sick ass in the ground all by myself.

MICKEY (cool)
Another day perhaps, but not today, Warden.

Mickey leaves FRAME.

McClusky looks like he's going to pop his cerebral cortex.  He
begins a heart attack.

Mickey and all exit the building.

The Warden, bucking with pain, looks up the Corridor where Mickey
and Mallory have just come from.  What he sees is his worst
nightmare.

Coming right at him are a HUNDRED ANGRY PRISONERS, shotguns,
sticks, numbchuks, razors, broken chairs waving, climbing over
the corpses of their fallen comrades, withstanding the hail of
fire from the Guards -- reaching for Dwight McClusky who is
lifted over their heads, having his heart attack, moved from hand
to hand like at a rock concert, then all we see are the tops of
his shoes as he is held upside down and torn to pieces.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A fogged moment of light strikes film and settles into an ECU of
WAYNE -- gasping a little too dramatically from his wounds.

Mallory's pointing the camera at him; she's laughing at what he
says.

The Scene that follows intercuts a normal format with cinema
verite style shot through the video camera. Sometimes the lip
sync is off.

WAYNE
This is Wayne Gale -- unfortunately no longer
"live."  I'm wounded and all my crew is dead.

MALLORY
Look up, look at me.  That is so good.

WAYNE
Mickey Knox's plan worked.  We walked out the
front door, into a news van, and made our get-
away.  When we were followed by patrol cars,
Mallory Knox killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan
Homolka and tossed his body out the back.

The wind is blowing through the pine trees above.  Insects buzz.
A vee of wild geese fly overhead honking, heading north for the
summer.

WAYNE
Mickey told authorities over my police band
that I would surely be next if they didn't give
up the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
employed, I don't know.  My only thought is
that it all happened too fast for arrangements
to be made.  We've just pulled off to the side
of the road to do this interview.  Tensions run
high --

Mickey screams O.S.

MICKEY (O.S.)
We ain't got all fuckin' dayl

WAYNE
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...

Wayne takes the CAMERA from MALLORY, while MICKEY, his wounds
like Mallory's taped, paces in and out of FRAME; in the BG,
gradually leaving frame, is OWEN.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan?
Did you think it would work?

MALLORY
Well, it wasn't 'till we got to that ground
floor that I totally realized they weren't
gonna shoot 'less we shot first.  When we got
out of the stairwell, I remember thinkin:  'Oh
my God.  This just might work.' But Mickey knew
it would work all along.  There wasn't any
doubt in his mind.

WAYNE (O.S.)
What did you think then?

MALLORY
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get
to be alone together.  And I wondered if I
could wait that long.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Did you have anything to do with the riot?

MALLORY
We had nothing to do with that riot.  That riot
was just -- whatchamacallit --

Mickey can be heard faintly in the BG.

MICKEY
Fate.

MALLORY
What he said.  We just didn't know jack shit
about any riot.  How are we supposed to organize
a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for
the past year, Wayne?  Just bleep out the fucks
and jack shits. Fuck, fuck, shit shit.
(laughs) I mean it's not like we care...If
they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing,
let 'em.  It won't exactly keep us up at night,
Wayne.  But the truth is...it was fate.

WAYNE
...and Fate it was!...and this is "American
Maniacs."

Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

MICKEY
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

WAYNE (O.S.)
So, what's next?

MALLORY (holding Mickey's hand)
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy.
Just enjoy each other's company...

MICKEY
Gotta go...

WAYNE (O.S.)
Wait! But how do you intend to disappear?  You're
probably the most famous couple in America.

MALLORY
Well, back in slave times they had a thing
called the underground railroad.  And we got a
whole fan club out there just waitin' to be
conductors (to the camera) So, you kids out
there, keep the faith.  Cause Mickey and
Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.

WAYNE
So...

MICKEY
Okay, end of interview.

Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
lowers it.

WAYNE
Okay, just let me swing around and film myself
asking the questions.  And then I'll do my
little wrap up and we're off.

Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
balances it on a fence post.

MICKEY
Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up, all right
Wayne.  But it won't be you starin' in the camera,
lookin' dumb, and actin' stupid.  Instead, you're
gonna be starin' down the barrels of our shotguns
and we're gonna be pullin' the triggers.

Wayne forces a chuckle.  Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and
into a THREESHOT.  Actually a FOUR SHOT with Owen there at first,
but again he slides out.  The NEWS VAN is parked in the EG.

WAYNE
That's a joke right?

Mickey pumps the slide on his shotgun. Mallory grabs her shot gun
from off the ground.

WAYNE
Just wait one fucking minute.

MICKEY
I said I'd give you an interview. Now unless
I'm mistaken, we just did an interview
(to Mallory)
We did an interview, didn't we?

MALLORY
Looked like an interview to me.

WAYNE (sincere)
Wait!  I don't know, but I kinda felt during
this ...this whole escape that a kind of bond --
(Wayne is shaking)
...developed between the three of us.  We're
kinda in this together, don't ya think?

MICKEY
No. Not really.  You're scum Wayne.  You did it
for ratings.  You poured gasoline on the fire.
You didn't give a shit about us or about
anything Wayne except yourself.  That's why
nobody really gives a shit about you Wayne.
That's why they didn't deploy helicoptors!

WAYNE
Mickey! What about the Indian?

MICKEY
What about him?

WAYNE
Didn't you say you were finished with killin'?
"Love beats the demon?"

MICKEY (sharing a look with Mallory)
I am. And it will...
(pause)
It's just that you're the last one, Wayne. You
gonna feed on your own misery.

WAYNE (new tone)
So big fuckin' deal, that's show business. Who
cares, so I'm a parasite....it's a "cruel
world" out there.  You were wronged. So what
else is new? The day you killed, your ass
belonged to us.  You did what you had to do.
So did I. We're married.
(Mallory laughing)
Think about it.  The point is we can do a
Salmon Rushdie thing next, books, talk shows,
all remote, we move around, duckin' and
bobbin', then we come up for air once in a
while.  Donahue, Oprah, Playboy...the mystery
avengers, do you know how big you could be?

MALLORY
Does he have an "off" button? Can we take out
his batteries?

MICKEY
We got a better idea.  How bout we kill you?

WAYNE (incensed)
Jesus Christ! What are you nitwits? You can't
kill me!  Without television you're nothing,
nothing...two kids, I made you Mickey, you owe
me.  Without me you're on the bus to fuckin'
diznee land.

MICKEY
(John Wayne voice to Mallory)
Let's make a little music Colorada.

WAYNE
Wait! Wait! Don't Mickey and Mallory always
leave somebody alive to tell the tale??

MICKEY
We are.
(points in camera)
Your camera.

WAYNE
NO!!!!  You can't shoot me.  I AM WAYNE GALE.
My lawyers...

Mickey and Mallory PUMP rounds into Wayne, whose body dances like
a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately.

Mickey slips a new WEDDING BAND on her finger -- and one for
himself.  Mallory is really happy.

They climb into the News Van.  They drive away.

Wayne's body lies peacefully in FRAME as the CAMERA rolls out of
film.

FADE IN:

INT. "AMERICAN MANIACS" NEWSVAN - DAY

MICKEY drives. MALLORY rides shotgun. The CAMERA moves and
reveals OWEN in back. Mallory strums Mickey's guitar.

OWEN
I liked Wayne.

MICKEY
He's resting, Owen.

OWEN (cryptic)
You know he'll never die...This is exciting!
How'd I do back there?

MICKEY
Not bad for a first timer

MALLORY
You got a real mean streak in ya, Owen.
That'll get you where you wanna go.

OWEN
I never knew I had it in me. Comin' as I do
from the fire and all... (a look) What about
you folks? You think you'll be able to lie low?

MICKEY
We're gonna give it a try, we love each other,
that's fo' sure.

OWEN
Love -- you can't beat that.

MALLORY
I had a dream last night.  We stood on the back
porch for a long time...(looking at Mickey)
listening to the rain and thunder...the sky lit
up...we was feelin' the warm air from Mexico...

MICKEY
Poetry...

OWEN (grinning)
Mexico? Never been...

MICKEY
And you ain't goin' either, Owen.  We promised
you a ride out, that's it.  We're droppin' you
next town.

OWEN
But you promised you'd take me with you!

MICKEY
I lied...

OWEN (very disappointed)
Too bad...I'll tell you what I'd really like,
though.

MICKEY
What's that?

OWEN
I'd really like a taste of old Mallory over
there.  I never got with the wild kind before.

Mickey turns his head to see if Owen's joking.

MICKEY
You can't talk like that, Owen.  Mean streak or
not, I don't wanna hear that kinda talk.

OWEN
I'm serious though.  I'd love to take her for a
test drive.  What do you say, Mallory? Are you
interested?

Mallory turns around with her gun loosely pointed at Owen.

MALLORY (mocking singsong)
Oh god -- can you feel my breasts? Can you
spread my ass? How's your pussy looking? Is
this for real? I swear I'd love to contain
myself but people like you...

Owen pulls his own gun up.

OWEN
Now, there's no reason to talk angry, Mallory.
You'll make me think you don't desire me.

MICKEY
All right!  That's enough bullshit!  I don't
like the fact you induced my wife to talk this
way...Put the guns down and can it.

Mallory puts her gun down.  Owen doesn't.

OWEN
Do you do everything he tells you?

MALLORY
Oh yeah, like a dog on a leash.
(to Mickey)
Oh my god this is like Murphy's Law.
Everywhere we go, there's some weirdo.

OWEN
Is that what's standing between you and me?
Mickey telling you what to do?

MALLORY
You better pull over and dump this prick before
I really get mad, Mickey

Mickey pulls to a severe stop, turns.

MICKEY
All right Owen...

He is staring down the barrel of Owen's gun. Owen has a crazy
grin on his face.

SPECIAL EFFECT: Owen now has the face of the DEMON!

Mickey understands.  He laughs.

Owen pulls the trigger, a BLAST fills the screen.

Mallory turns in STOP MOTION, looking at Owen with vengeance in
her eyes. She SCREAMS at what she sees.  ANOTHER BLAST fills the
screen.

CUT TO BLACK:

MUSIC UP -- Patti Smith.





THE END

INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
breakfast cafe. They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE, MR.
BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT, and the
big boss, JOE CABOT. Most are finished eating and are enjoying
coffee and conversation. Joe flips through a small address
book. Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about
Madonna.

MR. BROWN
"Like a Virgin" is all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick. The
whole song is a metaphor for big
dicks.

MR. BLONDE
No it's not. It's about a girl who
is very vulnerable and she's been
fucked over a few times. Then she
meets some guy who's really sensitive -

MR. BROWN
Whoa... whoa... time out Greenbay.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

JOE
(looking through his
address book)
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby...
Toby... think... think... think...

MR. BROWN
It's not about a nice girl who meets
a sensitive boy. Now granted that's
what "True Blue" is about, no argument
about that.

MR. ORANGE
Which one is "True Blue?"

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't remember "True Blue?" That
was a big ass hit for Madonna. Shit,
I don't even follow this Tops In
Pops shit, and I've at least heard
of "True Blue."

MR. ORANGE
Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't
heard of it. All I asked was how
does it go? Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

MR. WHITE
I hate Madonna.

MR. BLUE
I like her early stuff. You know,
"Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
once she got into her "Papa Don't
Preach" phase, I don't know, I tuned
out.

MR. BROWN
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a
point here. You're gonna make me
lose my train of thought.

JOE
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
girl.

MR. WHITE
What's that?

JOE
I found this old address book in a
jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age.
Toby what? What the fuck was her
last name?

MR. BROWN
Where was I?

MR. PINK
You said "True Blue" was about a
nice girl who finds a sensitive fella.
But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor
for big dicks.

MR. BROWN
Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s
about. It's about some cooze who's a
regular fuck machine. I mean all the
time, morning, day, night, afternoon,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

MR. BLUE
How many dicks was that?

MR. WHITE
A lot.

MR. BROWN
Then one day she meets a John Holmes
motherfucker, and it's like, whoa
baby. This mother fucker's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."
He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's
gettin' this serious dick action,
she's feelin' something she ain't
felt since forever. Pain.

JOE
Chew? Toby Chew? No.

MR. BROWN
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't
hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum
by now. But when this cat fucks her,
it hurts. It hurts like the first
time. The pain is reminding a fuck
machine what is was like to be a
virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."

The fellas crack up.

JOE
Wong?

MR. BROWN
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the
fuck do you know about it anyway?
You're still listening to Jerry-
fucking-Vale.

JOE
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know,
like the Chinese name?

Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They
fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

MR. WHITE
Give me this fucking thing.

JOE
What the fuck do you think you're
doin'? Give me my book back!

MR. WHITE
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe;
I'll give it back when we leave.

JOE
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we
leave, give it back now.

MR. WHITE
For the past fifteen minutes now,
you've just been droning on with
names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby
Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung...
fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's
big dick outta my right ear, and
Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my
left.

JOE
What do you care?

MR. WHITE
When you're annoying as hell, I care
a lot.

JOE
Give me my book.

MR. WHITE
You gonna put it away?

JOE
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
with it.

MR. WHITE
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to keep it.

MR. BLONDE
Joe, you want me to shoot him for
you?

MR. WHITE
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologize.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Have you guys been listening to K-
BILLY's super sounds of the seventies
weekend?

MR. PINK
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?

NICE GUY EDDIE
Can you believe the songs they been
playin'?

MR. PINK
No, I can't. You know what I heard
the other day? "Heartbeat-It's
Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco
and the DeFranco Family. I haven't
heard that since I was in fifth
fuckin' grade.

NICE GUY EDDIE
When I was coming down here, I was
playin' it. And "The Night the Lights
Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I
ain't heard that song since it was
big, but when it was big, I heard it
a million-trillion times. I'm
listening to it this morning, and
this was the first time I ever
realized that the lady singing the
song, was the one who killed Andy.

MR. BROWN
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed
the guy?

NICE GUY EDDIE
I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.

MR. BLONDE
They say it in the song.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I know, I heard it. I musta zoned
out whenever that part came on before.
I thought when she said that little
sister stuff, she was talkin' about
her sister-in-law, the cheatin' wife.

JOE
No, she did it. She killed the
cheatin' wife, too.

MR. WHITE
Who gives a damn?

The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She
has the check, and a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody more coffee.

JOE
No, we're gonna be hittin' it. I'll
take care of the check.

She hands the bill to him.

WAITRESS
Here ya go. Please pay at the
register, if you wouldn't mind.

JOE
Sure thing.

WAITRESS
You guys have a wonderful day.

They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.

JOE
I'll take care of this, you guys
leave the tip.
(to Mr. White)
And when I come back, I want my book
back.

MR. WHITE
Sorry, it's my book now.

JOE
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?

Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr. White acts
shot. Joe exits.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Okay, everybody cough up green for
the little lady.

Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
Everybody, that is, except Mr. Pink.

NICE GUY EDDIE
C'mon, throw in a buck.

MR. PINK
Uh-uh. I don't tip.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

MR. PINK
I don't believe in it.

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't believe in tipping?

MR. BROWN
(laughing)
I love this guy, he's a madman, this
guy.

MR. BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these ladies
make? They make shit.

MR. PINK
Don't give me that. She don't make
enough money, she can quit.

Everybody laughs.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that. So let's get
this straight. You never ever tip?

MR. PINK
I don't tip because society says I
gotta. I tip when somebody deserves
a tip. When somebody really puts
forth an effort, they deserve a little
something extra. But this tipping
automatically, that shit's for the
birds. As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

MR. BLUE
Our girl was nice.

MR. PINK
Our girl was okay. She didn't do
anything special.

MR. BLUE
What's something special, take ya in
the kitchen and suck your dick?

They all laugh.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I'd go over twelve percent for that.

MR. PINK
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've
been here a long fuckin' time, and
she's only filled my cup three times.
When I order coffee, I want it filled
six times.

MR. BLONDE
What if she's too busy?

MR. PINK
The words "too busy" shouldn't be in
a waitress's vocabulary.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee.

They all laugh.

MR. PINK
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage. When I worked
for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky
enough to have a job that society
deemed tipworthy.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard -

MR. ORANGE
It is that too -

NICE GUY EDDIE
It is that too. But it's also he
couldn't get a waiter job. You talk
like a pissed off dishwasher: "Fuck
those cunts and their fucking tips."

MR. BLONDE
So you don't care that they're
counting on your tip to live?

Mr. Pink rubs two of his fingers together.

MR. PINK
Do you know what this is? It's the
world's smallest violin, playing
just for the waitresses.

MR. WHITE
You don't have any idea what you're
talking about. These people bust
their ass. This is a hard job.

MR. PINK
So's working at McDonald's, but you
don't feel the need to tip them.
They're servin' ya food, you should
tip em. But no, society says tip
these guys over here, but not those
guys over there. That's bullshit.

MR. BLUE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's.

MR. PINK
Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers.

MR. BLUE
These people are taxed on the tips
they make. When you stiff 'em, you
cost them money.

MR. WHITE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country. It's the
one job basically any woman can get,
and make a living on. The reason is
because of tips.

MR. PINK
Fuck all that.

They all laugh.

MR. PINK
Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips. That's
fucked up. But that ain't my fault.
it would appear that waitresses are
just one of the many groups the
government fucks in the ass on a
regular basis. You show me a paper
says the government shouldn't do
that, I'll sign it. Put it to a vote,
I'll vote for it. But what I don't
do is play ball. And this non-college
bullshit you're telling me, I got
two words for that: "Learn to fuckin'
type." Cause if you're expecting me
to help out with the rent, you're in
for a big fuckin' surprise.

MR. ORANGE
He's convinced me. Give me my dollar
back.

Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.

JOE
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling.
Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?

MR. ORANGE
Mr. Pink.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Mr. Pink?
(to Mr. Pink)
Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't tip.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't tip?
(to Mr. Pink)
You don't tip? Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't believe in it.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't believe in it?
(to Mr. Pink)
You don't believe in it?

MR. ORANGE
Nope.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Shut up!
(to Mr. Pink)
Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard,
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

MR. PINK
Because you paid for the breakfast,
I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

JOE
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar,
and let's move.
(to Mr. White)
See what I'm dealing with here.
Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with
infants.

The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in the
F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying
a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House, talking amongst
themselves.

EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

CREDIT SEQUENCE

When the credit sequence is finished, we FADE TO BLACK:

Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.

Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING ASS,
through traffic.

Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:

SOMEBODY ELSE (O.S.)
Just hold on buddy boy.

Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

SOMEBODY (O.S.)
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed
me. Who would've fuckin' thought
that?

CUT TO:

INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the backseat.
He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers both him and the
backseat.

Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of the
getaway car. He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and out of
traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking
to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

They are the only two in the car.

MR. WHITE
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now! You're hurt. You're hurt really
fucking bad, but you ain't dying.

MR. ORANGE
(crying)
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.

MR. WHITE
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
had a degree in medicine. Are you a
doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me
please, are you a doctor?

MR. ORANGE
No, I'm not!

MR. WRITE
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
what you're talking about. So if
you're through giving me your amateur
opinion, lie back and listen to the
news. I'm taking you back to the
rendezvous, Joe's gonna get you a
doctor, the doctor's gonna fix you
up, and you're gonna be okay. Now
say it: You're gonna be okay. Say
it: You're gonna be okay!

Mr. Orange doesn't respond. Mr. White starts pounding on the
steering wheel.

MR. WHITE
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna
be okay!

MR. ORANGE
I'm okay.

MR. WHITE
(softly)
Correct.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse. Then the
door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
Mr. Orange inside.

Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

MR. WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and
wait for Joe. I can't do anything
for you, but when Joe gets here,
which should be anytime now, he'll
be able to help you. We're just gonna
sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are
we waiting for?

MR. ORANGE
Joe.

MR. WHITE
Bet your sweet ass we are.

Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
around the warehouse.

MR. ORANGE
(yelling)
Don't leave me!

Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

MR. WHITE
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right
here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

MR. ORANGE
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please
hold me.

Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange. Cradling
the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

MR. WHITE
(whispering)
Go ahead and be scared, you've been
brave enough for one day. I want you
to just relax now. You're not gonna
die, you're gonna be fine. When Joe
gets here, he'll make ya a hundred
percent again.

Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's
still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his friend.

MR. ORANGE
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the
ointment, but if help doesn't come
soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't
give a fuck about jail, I just don't
wanna die.

MR. WHITE
You're not gonna fucking die, all
right?

MR. ORANGE
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt,
and I'm hurt bad.

MR. WHITE
It's not good...

MR. ORANGE
Hey, bless your heart for what you're
trying to do. I was panicking for a
moment, but I've got my senses back
now. The situation is, I'm shot in
the belly. And without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

MR. WHITE
I can' take you to a hospital.

MR. ORANGE
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about
jail. But I can't die. You don't
have to take me in. Just drive me up
to the front, drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself. I won't
tell them anything. I swear to fucking
god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look
in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
(Mr. White does)
I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll
be safe.

MR. WHITE
Lie back down, and try to -

MR. ORANGE
I'm going to die! I need a doctor!
I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.

Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

MR. ORANGE
Take me to a doctor, take me to a
doctor, please.

Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps
inside.

MR. PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what?

Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

MR. PINK
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

MR. WHITE
Gun shot.

MR. PINK
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's
Brown?

MR. WHITE
Dead.

MR. PINK
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

MR. WHITE
How the fuck do you think? The cops
shot him.

MR. PINK
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
(referring to Mr.
Orange)
Is it bad?

MR. WHITE
As opposed to good?

MR. PINK
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked
us big time.

MR. WHITE
You really think we were set up?

MR. PINK
You even doubt it? I don't think we
got set up, I know we got set up! I
mean really, seriously, where did
all those cops come from, huh? One
minute they're not there, the next
minute they're there. I didn't hear
any sirens. The alarm went off, okay.
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes
response time. Unless a patrol car
is cruising that street, at that
particular moment, you got four
minutes before they can realistically
respond. In one minute there were
seventeen blue boys out there. All
loaded for bear, all knowing exactly
what the fuck they were doing, and
they were all just there! Remember
that second wave that showed up in
the cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm. But those
other motherfuckers were already
there, they were waiting for us.
(pause)
You haven't thought about this?

MR. WHITE
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there. And after we got
away, I've just been dealin' with
him.

MR. PINK
Well, you better start thinking about
it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking
about it. In fact, that's all I'm
thinking about. I came this close to
just driving off. Whoever set us up,
knows about this place. There could've
been cops sitting here waiting for
me. For all we know, there's cops,
driving fast, on their way here now.

MR. WHITE
Let's go in the other room...

The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We move
past it, and see down a hall.

INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door is
partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is obscured,
but Mr. White is in view.

MR. PINK (O.S.)
What the fuck am I doing here? I
felt funny about this job right off.
As soon as I felt it I should said
"No thank you", and walked. But I
never fucking listen. Every time I
ever got burned buying weed, I always
knew the guy wasn't right. I just
felt it. But I wanted to believe
him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it
really is Thai stick, then whoa baby.
But it's never Thai stick. And I
always said if I felt that way about
a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I
didn't, because of fuckin' money!

MR. WHITE
What's done is done, I need you cool.
Are you cool?

MR. PINK
I'm cool.

MR. WHITE
Splash some water on your face. Take
a breather.

We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
his face.

MR. WHITE
I'm gonna get me my smokes.

Mr. White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
OUT OF FRAME. We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards us,
bent over the sink. Then he grabs a towels, and dries his
face. Mr. White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of Chesterfields in
his hand.

MR. WHITE
Want a smoke?

MR. PINK
Why not?

The two men light up.

MR. WHITE
Okay, let's go through what happened.
We're in the place, everything's
going fine. Then the alarm gets
tripped. I turn around and all these
cops are outside. You're right, it
was like, bam! I blink my eyes are
they're there. Everybody starts going
apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts
shootin' all the -

MR. PINK
That's not correct.

MR. WHITE
What's wrong with it?

MR. PINK
The cops didn't show up after the
alarm went off. They didn't show
till after Mr. Blonde started shooting
everyone.

MR. WHITE
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw
the cops.

MR. PINK
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon.
They didn't let their presence be
known until after Mr. Blonde went
off. I'm not sayin' they weren't
there, I'm sayin' they were there.
But they didn't move in till Mr.
Blonde became a madman. That's how I
know we were set up. You can see
that, can't you, Mr. White?

MR. WHITE
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -

MR. PINK
Don't tell me your name, I don't
want to know! I sure as hell ain't
gonna tell ya mine.

MR. WHITE
You're right, this is bad.
(pause)
How did you get out?

MR. PINK
Shot my way out. Everybody was
shooting, so I just blasted my way
outta there.

CUT TO:

EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. He has a
canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other. If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down. We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.

FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink. We DOLLY with
them.

We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates. ROLLERGIRL is
plugged into a walkman. We hear the song she's listening to
LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK. She's twirling and skating backwards
to the beat of the song.

Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink. The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.

Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.

INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the car's
driver. Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood, shakes it
off, and points his magnum at the driver.

MR. PINK
Get outta the car! Get the fuck outta
the car!

The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
locked.

MR. PINK
Open the fucking door!

EXTREME CLOSEUP - DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.

EXT. STREET - DAY

DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at the
Cops.

Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

Cops FIRE.

INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it. SPEEDING down
the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The young cop takes off running and firing after the getaway
car. It's no use. Mr. Pink leaves him in the dust.

BACK TO:

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you
kill anybody?

MR. WHITE
A few cops.

MR. PINK
No real people?

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh, just cops.

MR. PINK
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

MR. WHITE
That was one of the most insane
fucking things I've ever seen. Why
the fuck would Joe hire somebody
like that?

MR. PINK
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I
gotta get out that door, and you're
standing in my way, one way of the
other, you're gettin' outta my way.

MR. WHITE
That's the way I look at it. A choice
between doin' ten years, and takin'
out some stupid motherfucker, ain't
no choice at all. But I ain't no
madman either. What the fuck was Joe
thinkin'? You can't work with a guy
like that. That motherfucker's
unstable. What do you think? Do you
think he panicked, or ya think he's
just trigger-happy?

MR. PINK
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac!
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us, when he shot up the place. I
came this fucking close -
(hold up two fingers
and makes a tiny
space between them)
to taking his ass out myself.
Everybody panics. When things get
tense, everybody panics. Everybody.
I don't care what your name is, you
can't help it. It's human nature.
But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic
in your head. Ya give yourself a
couple a seconds of panic, then you
get a grip and deal with the
situation. What you don't do, is
shoot up the place and kill everybody.

MR. WHITE
What you're supposed to do is act
like a fuckin' professional. A
psychopath is not a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath,
'cause ya don't know what those sick
assholes are gonna do next. I mean,
Jesus Christ, how old do you think
that black girl was? Twenty, maybe
twenty-one?

MR. PINK
Did ya see what happened to anybody
else?

MR. WHITE
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car
and Mr. Brown floored it. After that,
I don't know what went down.

MR. PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or
Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got
the foggiest. Once I got out, I never
looked back.

MR. WHITE
What do you think?

MR. PINK
What do I think? I think the cops
caught them, or killed 'em.

MR. WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through? You found a hole.

MR. PINK
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle.
But if they did get away, where the
fuck are they?

MR. WHITE
You don't think it's possible, one
of them got a hold of the diamonds
and pulled a -

MR. PINK
Nope.

MR. WHITE
How can you be so sure?

MR. PINK
I got the diamonds.

MR. WHITE
Where?

MR. PINK
I got 'em, all right?

MR. WHITE
Where? Are they out in the car?

MR. PINK
No, they're not in the car. No, I
don't have them on me. Ya wanna go
with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go
right now. But first listen to what
I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set
up! Somebody is in league with the
cops. We got a Judas in our midst.
And I'm thinkin' we should have our
fuckin' heads examined for waiting
around here.

MR. WHITE
That was the plan, we meet here.

MR. PINK
Then where is everybody? I say the
plan became null and void once we
found out we got a rat in the house.
We ain't got the slightest fuckin'
idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or
Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or
arrested. They could be sweatin'
'em, down at the station house right
now. Yeah they don't know the names,
but they can sing about this place.
I mean, that could be happening right
now. As we speak, the cops could be
in their cars, drivin' here this
minute.

MR. WHITE
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.

MR. PINK
What?

MR. WHITE
Two jobs back, it was a four man
job, we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

MR. PINK
No shit?

MR. WHITE
Thank god, we discovered in time. We
hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing.
Just walked away from it.

MR. PINK
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue?
Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he
set this whole thing up. Maybe he
set it up to set it up.

MR. WHITE
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a
long time. I can tell ya straight
up, Joe definitely didn't have
anything to do with this bullshit.

MR. PINK
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time.
I known Joe since I was a kid. But
me saying Joe definitely couldn't
have done it is ridiculous. I can
say I definitely didn't do it, cause
I know what I did or didn't do. But
I can't definitely say that about
anybody else, 'cause I don't
definitely know. For all I know,
you're the rat.

MR. WHITE
For all I know, you're the rat.

MR. PINK
Now you're using your head. For all
we know, he's the rat.

MR. WHITE
That kid in there is dying from a
fuckin' bullet that I saw him take.
So don't be calling him a rat.

MR. PINK
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's
a fuckin' rat. How many times do I
hafta say it before it sinks in your
skull?

The talking stops. The two men just stare at each other. Mr.
Pink breaks the silence.

MR. PINK
I gotta take a squirt, where's the
commode in this dungeon?

MR. WHITE
Go down the hall, turn left, up those
stairs, then turn right.

Mr. Pink exits frame, leaving Mr. White alone.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD:

"MR. WHITE"

EMPTY FRAME

In the background we see what looks like an office set up.

VOICE
How's Alabama?

MR. WHITE
Alabama? I haven't seen Alabama over
a year and a half.

VOICE
I thought you two were a team.

MR. WHITE
We were for a little while. Did about
four jobs together. Then decided to
call it quits. You push it long enough
that woman man thing gets in your
way after a while.

We now cut to see Joe behind his desk.

JOE
What's she doin' now?

MR. WHITE
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've
done a couple a jobs together. Good
little thief. So, explain the
telegram.

JOE
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin'
out of a diamond wholesaler's.

MR. WHITE
Can you move the ice afterwards? I
don't know nobody who can move ice.

JOE
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for
it. But what happened to Marsellus
Spivey? Didn't he always move your
ice?

MR. WHITE
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.

JOE
What for?

MR. WHITE
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?

JOE
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two
minutes. It's daylight, during
business hours, dealing with a crowd.
But you'll have the guys to deal
with the crowd.

MR. WHITE
How many employees?

JOE
Around twenty. Security pretty lax.
They almost always just deal in boxes.
Rough uncut stones they get from the
syndicate. On a certain day this
wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment
of polished stones from Israel.
They're like a way station. They are
gonna get picked up the next day and
sent to Vermont.

MR. WHITE
No, they're not.

The men share a laugh.

MR. WHITE
What's the cut, poppa?

JOE
Juicy, junior, real juicy.

FADE TO BLACK:

BACK TO THE GARAGE

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

We follow Mr. Pink, HANDHELD, back through the rooms and
hallways to the garage. We follow behind him up to Mr. White,
who's standing over Mr. Orange.

MR. PINK
So, I don't know about you, but me -
I'm gonna split, check into a motel
and lay low for a few days.

As he gets closer he sees Mr. Orange is out. He runs over to
them.

MR. PINK
So, is he dead or what?

MR. WHITE
He ain't dead.

MR. PINK
So what is it?

MR. WHITE
I think he's just passed out.

MR. PINK
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead fer sure.

Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

MR. WHITE
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't
get him to a hospital.

MR. PINK
We can't take him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE
Without medical attention, this man
won't live through the night. That
bullet in his belly is my fault. Now
while that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a helluva lot to
me. And I'm not gonna just sit around
and watch him die.

MR. PINK
Well, first things first, staying
here's goofy. We gotta book up.

MR. WHITE
So what do you suggest, we go to a
hotel? We got a guy who's shot in
the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds
like a stuck pig, and when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

MR. PINK
You gotta idea, spit it out.

MR. WHITE
Joe could help him. If we can get in
touch with Joe, Joe could get him to
a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to
come and see him.

During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a CLOSEUP of
Mr. White.

MR. PINK (O.S.)
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
gonna get in touch with him? He's
supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which is making me nervous about
being here. Even if Joe is on the up
and up, he's probably not gonna be
that happy with us. Joe planned a
robbery, but he's got a blood bath
on his hands now. Dead cops, dead
robbers, dead civilians... Jesus
Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna
have a lot of sympathy for our plight.
If I was him, I'd try and put as
much distance between me and this
mess an humanly possible.

MR. WHITE
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was
askin' me to take him to a hospital.
Now I don't like turning him over to
the cops, but if we don't, he's dead.
He begged me to do it. I told him to
hold off till Joe got here.

MR. PINK (O.S.)
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're
on our own. Now, I don't know a
goddamn body who can help him, so if
you know somebody, call 'em.

MR. WHITE
I don't know anybody.

MR. PINK (O.S.)
Well, I guess we drop him off at the
hospital. Since he don't know nothin'
about us, I say it's his decision.

MR. WHITE'S POV:

CLOSEUP - MR. PINK

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
Well, he knows a little about me.

MR. PINK
You didn't tell him your name, did
ya?

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
I told him my first name, and where
I'm from.

There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink, then
he SCREAMS:

MR. PINK
Why!

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
I told him where I was from a few
days ago. It was just a casual
conversation.

MR. PINK
And what was tellin him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
He asked.

Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
We had just gotten away from the
cops. He just got shot. It was my
fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a
fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming.
I swear to god, I thought we was
gonna die right then and there. I'm
tryin' to comfort him, telling him
not to worry, he's gonna be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him. And he
asked me what my name was. I mean,
the man was dyin' in my arms. What
the fuck was I supposed to tell him,
"Sorry, I can't give out that
information, it's against the rules.
I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I
shoulda, but I couldn't.

MR. PINK
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
beautiful -

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
Don't fuckin' patronize me.

MR. PINK
One question: Do they have a sheet
on you, where you told him you're
from?

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
Of course.

MR. PINK
Well that's that, then. I mean, I
was worried about mug shot
possibilities already. But now he
knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
what your first name is, (c) where
you're from and (d) what your
specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta
show him a helluva lot of pictures
for him to pick you out. That's it
right, you didn't tell him anything
else that could narrow down the
selection?

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
If I have to tell you again to back
off, me an you are gonna go round
and round.

Mr. Pink walks out of the CLOSEUP and turns his back on Mr.
White. Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

MR. PINK
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
If we don't, he'll die.

MR. PINK
And I'm very sad about that. But
some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
That fuckin did it!

Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in the
mouth.

END OF POV

Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and realistic
fight. They go at each other like a couple of alley cats.

As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

MR. WHITE
You little motherfucker!

Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

MR. PINK
Ya wanna fuck with me?! I'll show
you who you're fuckin with!

The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING. Mr.
White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
and goes for his own weapon.

The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

MR. WHITE
You wanna shoot me, you little piece
of shit? Take a shot!

MR. PINK
Fuck you, White! I didn't create
this situation, I'm just dealin'
with it. You're acting like a first-
year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a
professional. They get him, they can
get you, they get you, they get closer
to me, and that can't happen. And
you, you motherfucker, are looking
at me like it's my fault. I didn't
tell him my name. I didn't tell him
where I was from. I didn't tell him
what I knew better than to tell him.
Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost
told me your name. You, buddy, are
stuck in a situation you created. So
if you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

MR. PINK
So if you wanna shoot somebody, put
that gun in your mouth and shoot
yourself.

Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

VOICE (O.S.)
You kids don't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start crying.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM CLOSEUP ON MR. BLONDE

The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and
eating a hot dog.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought you
might've gotten caught. What happened?

Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and
starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out.

He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he just
eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr. Pink
tries to talk through it.

We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

MR. PINK
Really, how did you get away?

Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.

MR. PINK
You saw what happened to me, I found
a hole and booked.

Silence.

MR. PINK
Where's Mr. Blue?

Blonde looks in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
We were hopin' you two would be
together.

Blonde looks out the window.

MR. PINK
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr. Blue and you?

Blonde walks away from the window.

MR. PINK
We were worried the cops got ya.

Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

MR. PINK
He got it in the belly. He's still
alive, but won't be for long.

MR. WHITE
Enough! You better start talkin' to
us, asshole, cause we got shit we
need to talk about. We're already
freaked out, we need you actin freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our
hip.

Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
towards them.

MR. BLONDE
So, talk.

MR. WHITE
We think we got a rat in the house.

MR. PINK
I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

MR. BLONDE
What would ever make you think that?

MR. WHITE
Is that supposed to be funny?

MR. PINK
We don't think this place is safe.

MR. WHITE
This place just ain't secure anymore.
We're leaving, and you should go
with us.

MR. BLONDE
Nobody's going anywhere.

Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.

After a few beats the silence is broken.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
Piss on this turd, we're outta here.

Mr. White turns to leave.

MR. BLONDE
Don't take another step, Mr. White.

Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr.
Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Fuck you, maniac! It's your fuckin'
fault we're in so much trouble.

Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. He looks to Mr. Pink.

MR. BLONDE
(referring to Mr.
White)
What's this guy's problem?

MR. WHITE
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta
problem. I gotta big problem with
any trigger-happy madman who almost
gets me shot!

MR. BLONDE
What're you talkin' about?

MR. WHITE
That fuckin' shooting spree in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
they deserve what they got.

MR. WHITE
You almost killed me, asshole! If I
had any idea what type of guy you
were, I never would've agreed to
work with you.

MR. BLONDE
You gonna bark all day, little doggie,
or are you gonna bite?

MR. WHITE
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't
catch it. Would you repeat it?

MR. BLONDE
(slowly)
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day,
dog, or are you gonna bite."

MR. PINK
Both of you two assholes knock it
the fuck off and calm down!

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Blonde)
So you wanna git bit, huh?

MR. PINK
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
fuckin' playground!
(pause)
I don't believe this shit, both of
you got ten years on me, and I'm the
only one actin like a professional.
You guys act like a bunch of fuckin'
niggers. You ever work a job with a
bunch of niggers? They're just like
you two, always fightin', always
sayin' they're gonna kill one another.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
You said yourself, you thought about
takin' him out.

MR. PINK
Then. That time has passed. Right
now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I
completely trust. He's too fuckin'
homicidal to be workin' with the
cops.

MR. WHITE
You takin' his side?

MR. PINK
Fuck sides! What we need is a little
solidarity here. Somebody's stickin'
a red hot poker up our asses and we
gotta find out whose hand's on the
handle. Now I know I'm no piece of
shit...
(referring to Mr.
White)
And I'm pretty sure you're a good
boy...
(referring to Mr.
Blonde)
And I'm fuckin positive you're on
the level. So let's figure out who's
the bad guy.

Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
talking about Madonna.

MR. BLONDE
Well, that was sure exciting.
(to Mr. White)
You're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't
you? Me too. I don't know about the
rest of you fellas, but my heart's
beatin' fast.
(pause for a beat)
Okay you guys, follow me.

Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

MR. WHITE
Follow you where?

MR. BLONDE
Down to my car.

MR. WHITE
Why?

MR. BLONDE
It's a surprise.

Mr. Blonde walks out.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars are parked out front. Mr. Blonde is walking towards
the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are walking behind.
The Camera is HANDHELD following behind them.

MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.

MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.

MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?

MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.

MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think
Nice Guy's anywhere but on a plane
half way to Costa Rica?

MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him. He's on
his way down here, and nobody's going
anywhere till be gets here.

MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
the fuck didn't you say that in the
first place?

MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.

MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?

MR. BLONDE
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look
at the little surprise I brought
you.

Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car. A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

MR. BLONDE
Since we got to wait for Nice Guy
Eddie anyway, let's talk to our boy
in blue here and see if he knows
anything about this rat business.

The three crooks share a frightening laugh. We slowly ZOOM
INTO a CLOSEUP of the cop.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD:

"MR. BLONDE"

INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

We're inside the office of Joe Cabot. Joe's on the phone,
sitting behind his desk.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, I'm tellin' you don't worry
about it. You had a bad couple of
months, it happens.
(pause)
Sid, Sid, Sid... Stop, you're
embarrassing me. I don't need to be
told what I already know. When you
have bad months, you do what every
business man in the worlds does, I
don't care if he's Donald Trump or
Irving the tailor. Ya ride it out.

There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

JOE
Come in.

One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps inside.
Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks towards
the man.

TEDDY
Vic Vega's outside.

JOE
Tell him to come in.

Teddy leaves.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, a friend of mine's here. I gotta
go.
(pause)
Good enough, bye.

He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the front
of the desk.

Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
in.

Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr. Blonde.
Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies style jacket.

Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

The two men embrace each other. Teddy leaves, closing the
door behind him.

JOE
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin'
good, ain't it?

VIC
It's a change.

JOE
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?

VIC
Sure.

JOE
Take a seat.

Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet. Vic sits in a chair set
in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
(while he pours the
drink)
Who's your parole officer?

VIC
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour
Scagnetti.

JOE
How is he?

VIC
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave
the halfway house.

JOE
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin'
jungle bunny goes out there, slits
some old woman's throat for twenty-
five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris
Day as a parole officer. But a good
fella like you gets stuck with a
ball-bustin' prick.

Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. Vic
swallows some Remy.

VIC
I just want you to know, Joe, how
much I appreciate your care packages
on the inside.

JOE
What the hell did you expect me to
do? Just forget about you?

VIC
I just wanted you to know, they meant
a lot.

JOE
It's the least I could do Vic. I
wish I coulda done more.
(Joe flashes a side
grin at Vic)
Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story?
What're your plans?

VIC
Well, what I wanna do is go back to
work. But I got this Scagnetti prick
deep up my ass. He won't let me leave
the halfway house till I get some
piece of shit job. My plans have
always been to be part of the team
again.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

JOE
Come in.

The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie. Vic
turns around in his seat and sees him.

EDDIE
(to Vic)
I see ya sittin here, but I don't
believe it.

Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

EDDIE
How ya doin', Toothpick?

VIC
Fine, now.

EDDIE
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you
up personally at the pen. This whole
week's just been crazy. I've had my
head up my ass the entire time.

VIC
Funny you should mention it. That's
what your father and I been talkin'
about.

EDDIE
That I should've picked you up?

VIC
No. That your head's been up your
ass. I walk through the door and Joe
says "Vic, you're back, thank god.
Finally somebody who knows what the
fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie,
my son, is a fuck up." And I say
"Well, Joe, I coulda told you that."
"I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My
son, I love him, but he's taking my
business and flushing it down the
fuckin' toilet! "
(to Joe)
I'm not tellin' tales out of school.
You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.

JOE
Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
hear it this way. But when Vic asked
me how's business, well, you don't
lie to a man who's just done four
years in the slammer for ya.

Eddie bobs his head up and down.

EDDIE
Oh really, is that a fact?

Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle
on the floor of Joe's office.

Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

JOE
(yelling)
Okay, okay, enough, enough! Playtime's
over! You wanna roll around on the
floor, do it in Eddie's office, not
mine!

The two men break it up. They are completely disheveled,
hair a mess, shirttails out. As they get themselves together,
they continue to taunt one another.

EDDIE
Daddy, did ya see that?

JOE
What?

EDDIE
Guy got me on the ground, tried to
fuck me.

VIC
You fuckin' wish.

EDDIE
You tried to fuck me in my father's
office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic,
whatever you wanna do in the privacy
of your own home, go do it. But don't
try to fuck me. I don't think of you
that way. I mean, I like you a lot -

VIC
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't
throw you to the crew.

EDDIE
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four
years fuckin' punks in the ass made
you appreciate prime rib when you
get it.

VIC
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd
make you my dog's bitch. You'd be
suckin' the dick and going down on a
mangy T-bone hound.

EDDIE
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
walks into jail a white man, walks
out talkin' like a nigger. It's all
that black semen been shootin' up
his butt. It's backed up into his
brain and comes out of his mouth.

JOE
Are you two finished? We were talkin'
about some serious shit when you
came in Eddie. We got a big problem
we're tryin' to solve. Now Eddie,
would you like to sit down and help
us solve it, or do you two wanna
piss fart around?

Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it. So they both
take seats in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a
parole problem.

EDDIE
Really? Who's your P.O.?

VIC
Seymour Scagnetti.

EDDIE
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a
motherfucker.

VIC
He is a motherfucker. He won't let
me leave the halfway house till I
get some piece of shit job.

EDDIE
You're coming back to work for us,
right?

VIC
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole
I got an honest-to-goodness job before
he'll let me move out on my own. I
can't work for you guys and be worried
about gettin' back before ten o'clock
curfew.

JOE
(to Eddie)
We can work this out, can't we?

EDDIE
This isn't all that bad. We can give
you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put
you on the rotation at Long Beach as
a dock worker.

VIC
I don't wanna lift crates.

EDDIE
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't
really work there. But as far as the
records are concerned, you do. I
call up Matthews, the foreman, tell
him he's got a new guy. You're on
the schedule. You got a timecard,
it's clocked in and out for you
everyday, and you get a pay check at
the end of the week. And ya know
dock workers don't do too bad. So
you can move into a halfway decent
place without Scagnetti thinkin "what
the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever
wants to make a surprise visit, you're
gone that day. That day we sent you
to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit
you needed to unload there. You're
at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a
bunch of shit and bringing it back.
Part of your job is goin' different
places - and we got places all over
the place.

JOE
(to Vic)
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
(to Eddie)
Vic was worried.

EDDIE
Me and you'll drive down to Long
Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you
to Matthews, tell him what's going
on.

VIC
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
(pause)
When do you think you'll need me for
real work?

JOE
Well, it's kinda a strange time right
now. Things are kinda -

EDDIE
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas
coming up. And we're kinda just gettin
ready for that right now.

JOE
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach.
Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti
fuck off your back, and we'll be
talking to ya.

EDDIE
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear
it out. I know you don't like to use
any of the boys on these jobs, but
technically, Vic ain't one of the
boys. He's been gone for four years.
He ain't on no one's list. Ya know
he can handle himself, ya know you
can trust him.

Joe looks at Vic.

Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

JOE
How would you feel about pullin' a
heist with about five other guys?

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
portable car phone. The sounds of the seventies are coming
out of his car radio in the form of "LOVE GOES WHERE MY
ROSEMARY GOES" by Edison Lighthouse.

EDDIE
(into phone)
Hey Dov, we got a major situation
here.
(pause)
I know you know that. I gotta talk
with daddy and find out what he wants
done.

FLASH ON

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
behind his back. Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde surround
him and proceed to beat the shit out of him. "LOVE GROWS..."
PLAYS over the soundtrack.

BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
All I know is what Vic told me. He
said the place turned into a fuckin'
bullet festival. He took a cop as
hostage, just to get the fuck out of
there.

FLASH ON

WAREHOUSE

The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.

BACK TO EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
Do I sound like I'm jokin'? He's
fuckin' driving around with the cop
in his trunk.
(pause)
I don't know who did that. I don't
know who has the loot, if anybody
has the loot. Who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not... I will
know, I'm practically there. But
what do I tell these guys about daddy?
(pause)
You sure that's what he said?
(pause)
Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.

Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse. He gets out of the
car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.

Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open, and
steps inside the warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still WAILING
on him.

Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

EDDIE
What in Sam Hill is goin' on?

Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

MR. PINK
Hey, Nice Guy, we got
a -

MR WHITE
You askin' what's goin'
on? Where the fuck is Joe?

Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!

MR. WHITE
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on
us if we don't get him taken care
of.

MR. PINK
We were set up, the cops were waiting
for us.

EDDIE
What? Nobody set anybody up.

MR. PINK
The cops were there waitin' for us!

EDDIE
Bullshit.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there,
we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the
cops had that store staked out.

EDDIE
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

MR. PINK
What the fuck d'you think we've been
askin' each other?

EDDIE
And what are your answers? Was it
me? You think I set you up?

MR. PINK
I don't know, but somebody did.

EDDIE
Nobody did. You assholes turn the
jewelry store into a wild west show,
and you wonder why cops show up.

MR. BLONDE
Where's Joseph?

EDDIE
I ain't talked to him. I talked to
Dov. Dov said he's comin' out here,
and he's fucking pissed.

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
I told ya he'd be pissed.

MR. WHITE
(pointing to Mr. Orange)
What are you gonna do about him?

EDDIE
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance
to breathe. I got a few questions of
my own, ya know.

MR. WHITE
You ain't dying, he is.

EDDIE
I'll call somebody.

MR. WHITE
Who?

EDDIE
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you
think. I'll call a doctor, take care
of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's
Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?

MR. PINK
Brown's dead, we don't know about
Blue.

EDDIE
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?

MR. BLONDE
Well, he's either dead or he's alive
or the cops got him or they don't.

DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

EDDIE (O.S.)
I take it this is the bastard you
told me about.
(referring to the cop)
Why the hell are you beating on him?

MR. PINK
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us
up.

EDDIE
Would you stop it with that shit!
You beat on this prick enough, he'll
tell ya he started the Chicago fire.
That don't necessarily make it so.
Okay, first things fucking last,
where's the shit? Please tell me
somebody brought something with them.

MR. PINK
I got a bag. I stashed it till I
could be sure this place wasn't a
police station.

EDDIE
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta
get rid of all those cars. It looks
like Sam's hot car lot outside.
(pointing to Mr. Blonde)
You stay here and babysit Orange and
the cop.
(referring to Mr.
Pink and Mr. White)
You two take a car each, I'll follow
ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up,
then we'll pick up the stones. And
while I'm following you, I'll arrange
for some sort of a doctor for our
friend.

MR. WHITE
We can't leave these guys with him.

Meaning Mr. Blonde.

EDDIE
Why not?

Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Because this guy's a fucking psycho.
And if you think Joe's pissed at us,
that ain't nothing compared to how
pissed off I am at him, for puttin'
me in the same room as this bastard.

MR. BLONDE
(to Eddie)
You see what I been puttin' up with?
As soon as I walk through the door
I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm
what you told me about us stayin'
put and Mr. White whips out his gun,
sticks it in my face, and starts
screaming "You motherfucker, I'm
gonna blow you away, blah, blah,
blah."

MR. WHITE
He's the reason the place turned
into a shooting gallery.
(to Mr. Pink)
What are you, a silent partner?
Fuckin' tell him.

MR. PINK
He seems all right now, but he went
crazy in the store.

MR. WHITE
This is what he was doin'.

Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the store.

MR. BLONDE
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
They touched it. I blew 'em full of
holes. If they hadn't done what I
told 'em not it, they'd still be
alive.

MR. WHITE
That's your excuse for going on a
kill crazy rampage?

MR. BLONDE
I don't like alarms.

EDDIE
What does it matter who stays with
the cop? We ain't lettin' him go.
Not after he's seen everybody. You
should've never took him outta your
trunk in the first place.

MR. PINK
We were trying to find out what he
knew about the set up.

EDDIE
There is no fuckin' set up!
(Eddie takes charge)
Look, this is the news. Blondie, you
stay here and take care of them two.
White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if
Joe gets here and sees all those
fucking cars parked out front, he's
going to be as mad at me as he is at
you.

Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
talking amongst themselves.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

Mr. Blonde closes the door after them. He then slowly turns
his head towards the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Alone at last.

CLOSEUP - COP'S FACE

MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
Now where were we?

COP
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking set up. I've only
been on the force eight months, nobody
tells me anything! I don't know
anything! You can torture me if you
want -

MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
Thanks, don't mind if I do.

COP
Your boss even said there wasn't a
set up.

MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
First off, I don't have a boss. Are
you clear about that?

He SLAPS the cop's face.

MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
I asked you a question. Are you clear
about that?

COP
Yes.

MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I
don't really care about what you
know or don't know. I'm gonna torture
you for awhile regardless. Not to
get information, but because torturing
a cop amuses me. There's nothing you
can say, I've heard it all before.
There's nothing you can do. Except
pray for a quick death, which you
ain't gonna get.

He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.

COP'S POV

Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S "super
sounds of the seventies" weekend.

He turns on the radio.

Stealer's Wheel's hit "STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU" PLAYS
over the speaker.

NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop. He opens a razor.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's / our face, holding
the razor, singing along with the song.

Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

A SLASH across the face.

The cop / camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's / our face, singing
along with the seventies hit.

Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's / our ear.

The cop / camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop / us to see.

INT. / EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

We follow Mr. Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse... to
his car. He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of
gasoline.

He walks back inside the warehouse...

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

...carrying the can of gas.

Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's BEGGING
him not to do this.

Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

MR. BLONDE
"Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to
the right. Here I am, stuck in the
middle with you."

He moves the match up to the cop...

...when a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the bloody
Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET HITS
and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody trail
behind him.

When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

MR. ORANGE
(feebly)
What's your name?

COP
Marvin.

MR. ORANGE
Marvin what?

COP
Marvin Nash.

MR. ORANGE
Listen to me, Marvin Nash. I'm a
cop.

MARVIN
I know.

MR. ORANGE
(surprised)
You do?

MARVIN
Your name's Freddy something.

MR. ORANGE
Freddy Newendyke.

MARVIN
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once,
about five months ago.

MR. ORANGE
Shit. I don't remember that at all.

MARVIN
I do.
(pause)
How do I look?

The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

MR. ORANGE
I don't know what to tell you Marvin.

Marvin starts to weep.

MARVIN
That fucking bastard! That fucking
sick fucking bastard!

MR. ORANGE
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's
officers positioned and waiting to
move in a block away.

MARVIN
(screaming)
What the fuck are they waiting for?
That motherfucker cut off my ear! He
slashed my face! I'm deformed!

MR. ORANGE
And I'm dying. They don't know that.
All they know is they're not to make
a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I
was sent undercover to get Cabot.
You heard 'em, they said he's on his
way. Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin. We're just gonna sit here
and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his
fuckin' head through that door.

TITLE CARD:

"MR. ORANGE"

INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a Malcom
X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star on it, and
a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny bacon, cheese and
avocado burger. He sits in a booth all alone. He's waiting
for somebody. As he waits, he practically empties an entire
bottle of ketchup on his french fries, not by mistake either -
that's just how he likes it.

We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing a
high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot
Holdaway, and head his way. Holdaway sees Freddy bop towards
him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered across his face.

CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
We hear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's
inside. Cabot's doing a job and take
a big fat guess who he wants on the
team?

HOLDAWAY
This better not be some Freddy joke.

LOW ANGLE looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

FREDDY
It ain't no joke, I'm in there. I'm
up his ass.

CLOSEUP - HOLDAWAY

Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then smiles.

HOLDAWAY
Congratulations.

EXT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway. Freddy's doing a lot of
talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.

INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

We are frozen on a MEDIUM CLOSEUP of Holdaway listening to
Freddy. We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to
meet me. He says I should just hang
around my apartment and wait for a
phone call. Well after waiting three
goddamn days by the fuckin' phone,
he calls me last night and says Joe's
ready, and he'll pick me up in fifteen
minutes.

The freeze frame ENDS. Holdaway comes suddenly up to speed
and says:

HOLDAWAY
Who all picked you up?

From here to end we cut back and forth.

FREDDY
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...

HOLDAWAY
...What bar?

FREDDY
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When
we got there, I met Joe and a guy
named Mr. White. It's a phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

HOLDAWAY
You ever seen this motherfucker
before?

FREDDY
Who, Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one
of Cabot's soldiers either. He's
gotta be from outta town. But Joe
knows him real well.

HOLDAWAY
How can you tell?

FREDDY
The way they talk to each other. You
can tell they're buddies.

HOLDAWAY
Did the two of you talk?

FREDDY
Me and Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
A little.

HOLDAWAY
What about?

FREDDY
The Brewers.

HOLDAWAY
The Milwaukee Brewers?

FREDDY
Yeah. They had just won the night
before, and he made a killing off
'em.

HOLDAWAY
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan,
his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.
And I'll bet you everything from a
diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I-
know, that in Milwaukee they got a
sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's
ass. I want you to go through the
mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with
a history of armed robbery, and put
a name to that face.

Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

HOLDAWAY
(with his mouth full)
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?

FREDDY
Where I was from, who I knew, how I
knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit
like that.

Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now. He
motions for Freddy to elaborate.

FREDDY
He asked me if I ever done armed
robbery before. I read him my credits.
I robbed a few gas and sips, sold
some weed, told him recently I held
the shotgun while me and another guy
pulled down a poker game in Portland.

CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CLOSEUP.

HOLDAWAY(O.S.)
Didja use the commode story?

FREDDY
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous. Holdaway
wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt. Freddy sits on one
of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket, looking at
pieces of paper stapled together.

FREDDY
What's this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a scene. Memorize it.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon
Brando. To do this job you got to be
a great actor. You got to be
naturalistic. You got to be
naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a
great actor you're a bad actor, and
bad acting is bullshit in this job.

FREDDY
(referring to the
papers)
But what is this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug
deal.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

FREDDY
I gotta memorize all this shit?

HOLDAWAY
It's like a joke. You remember what's
important, and the rest you make
your own. The only way to make it
your own is to keep sayin' it, and
sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin'
it, and sayin' it.

FREDDY
I can do that.

HOLDAWAY
The things you gotta remember are
the details. It's the details that
sell your story. Now this story takes
place in this men's room. So you
gotta know the details about this
men's room. You gotta know they got
a blower instead of a towel to dry
your hands. You gotta know the stalls
ain't got no doors. You gotta know
whether they got liquid or powdered
soap, whether they got hot water or
not, 'cause if you do your job when
you tell your story, everybody should
believe it. And if you tell your
story to somebody who's actually
taken a piss in this men's room, and
you get one detail they remember
right, they'll swear by you.

INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing
the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but he's still
reading it from the page, and every once in a while he
stumbles over his words.

FREDDY
...this was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought of '86. I still
had a connection. Which was insane,
'cause you couldn't get weed any
fuckin' where then. Anyway, I had a
connection with this hippie chick up
in Santa Cruz. All and my friends
knew it. And they'd give me a call
and say, "Hey, Freddy, you buyin'
some, you think you could buy me
some too?" They knew I smoked, so
they'd ask me to buy a little for
them when I was buyin'. But it got
to be every time I bought some weed,
I was buyin' for four or five
different people. Finally I said,
"Fuck this shit." I'm makin' this
bitch rich. She didn't have to do
jack shit, she never even had to
meet these people. I was fuckin'
doin' all the work. So I got together
with her and told her, "Hey, I'm
sick of this shit. I'm comin' through
for everybody, and nobody's comin'
through for me. So, either I'm gonna
tell all my friends to find their
own source, or you give me a bunch
of weed, I'll sell it to them, give
you the money, minus ten percent,
and I get my pot for free." So, I
did if for awhile...

FREDDY EXITS FRAME

CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Another empty frame, except obviously outside. Freddy enters
frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene,
finishing his sentence. When we move to a wider shot we see
Freddy performing his monologue to Holdaway in a parking
lot. Holdaway sits on the hood of his beat-up car. Freddy
paces back and forth as he performs his story.

FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain in
the ass. People called me on the
phone all the fuckin' time. I couldn't
rent a fuckin' tape without six phone
calls interrupting me. "Hey, Freddy,
when's the next time you're gettin'
some?" "Motherfucker, I'm tryin' to
watch 'Lost Boys' - when I have some,
I'll let you know." And then these
rinky-dink pot heads come by - there's
my friends and everything, but still.
I got all my shit laid out in sixty
dollar bags. Well, they don't want
sixty dollars worth. They want ten
dollars worth. Breaking it up is a
major fuckin' pain in the ass. I
don't even know how much ten dollars
worth is. "Well, fuck, man, I don't
want that much around. If I have
that much around I'll smoke it."
"Hey, if you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem. You
motherfuckers been smokin' for five
years, be a adult about it." Finally
I just told my connection, count me
out. But as it turns out, I'm the
best guy she had, and she depended a
lot on my business. But I was still
sick to death of it. And she's trying
to talk me into not quitin'. Now
this was a very weird situation,
'cause I don't know if you remember
back in '86, there was a major fuckin'
drought. Nobody and anything. People
were livin' on resin and smokin' the
wood in their pipes for months. And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin' me to sell it. So I told her
I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man
anymore. But I would take a little
bit and sell it to my close, close,
close friends. She agreed to that,
and said we'd keep the same
arrangement as before, ten percent
and free pot for me, as long as I
helped her out that weekend. She had
a brick of weed she was sellin', and
she didn't want to go to the buy
alone...

CUT TO:

INT. BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy continues his story.
The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

FREDDY
...Her brother usually goes with
her, but he's in county unexpectedly.

MR. WHITE
What for?

FREDDY
Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him for something, found
the warrants on 'im, took 'im to
jail. She doesn't want to walk around
alone with all that weed. Well, I
don't wanna do this, I have a bad
feeling about it, but she keeps askin'
me, keeps askin' me, finally I said
okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to
it. Well, we're picking this guy up
at the train station.

JOE
You're picking the buyer up at the
train station? You're carrying the
weed on you?

FREDDY
Yeah, the guy needed it right away.
Don't ask me why. So we get to the
train station, and we're waitin' for
the guy. Now I'm carrying the weed
in one of those carry-on bags, and I
gotta take a piss. So I tell the
connection I'll be right back, I'm
goin' to the little boys room...

CUT TO:

INT. MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY

MEDIUM ON FREDDY

He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
shoulder. Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks. We move
into a CLOSEUP.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...So I walk into the men's room,
and who's standing there?

FREEZE FRAME on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles
County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd. All of their eyes
are on Freddy. Everyone is frozen.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.

NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
They were waiting for you?

FREDDY (V.O.)
No. They were just a bunch of cops
hangin' out in the men's room,
talkin'. When I walked through the
door they all stopped what they were
talking about and looked at me.

BACK TO BAR

EXTREME CLOSEUP ON MR. WHITE

MR. WHITE
That's hard, man. That's a fuckin'
hard situation.

BACK TO MEN'S ROOM

EXTREME CLOSEUP ON GERMAN SHEPHERD

Barking his head off.

FREDDY (V.O.)
The German Shepherd starts barkin'.
He's barkin' at me. I mean it's
obvious he's barkin' at me.

We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room. We can
hear the dog barking.

FREDDY (V.O.)
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in my veins, everything I
has was screaming, "Take off, man,
just take off, get the fuck outta
there! "Panic hit me like a bucket
of water. First there was the shock
of it - BAM, right in the face! Then
I'm just standin' there drenched in
panic. And all those sheriffs are
lookin' at me and they know. They
can smell it. As sure as that fuckin'
dog can, they can smell it on me.

FREEZE FRAME

Freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in front of the sheriffs.
It suddenly jerks to life, and moves to speed. The dog is
barking. Freddy moves to his right, out of frame. We stay on
the sheriffs. One sheriff yells at the dog.

SHERIFF #1
Shut up!

The dog quiets down. Sheriff #2 continues with his story. A
couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen, but
as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

SHERIFF #2
So my gun's drawn, right? I got it
aimed right at him. I tell 'em,
"Freeze, don't fuckin' move." And
the little idiot's lookin' at me,
nodding his head "Yes," sayin' "I
know... I know... I know." Meanwhile
his right hand is creepin' towards
his glove box. So I scream at him,
"Asshole, you better fuckin' freeze
right now! " And he's still lookin'
right at me, saying "I know... I
know... I know." And his right hand's
still going for the glove box.

THE CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up against
the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna shoot
you in the face right now if you
don't put your hands on the fuckin'
dash." And the guy's girlfriend, a
real sexy Oriental bitch, starts
screamin' at him, "Chuck, are you
out of your mind? Put your hands on
the dash like the officer said." And
then like nothing, the guy snaps out
of it and casually puts his hands on
the dash.

Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past the
sheriffs over to the sink.

THE CAMERA PANS with him. A sheriff is sitting on a sink. He
looks down and watches Freddy wash his hands.

SHERIFF #1
What was he goin' for?

SHERIFF #2
His registration. Stupid fuckin'
citizen, doesn't have the slightest
idea how close he came to gettin'
shot.

Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them, but
there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns on the
drying machine. He can't hear anything the sheriffs say now.
The sound of the machine dominates the sound track.

These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

CLOSEUP - FREDDY

CLOSEUP - His HANDS, rubbing each other getting blown dry.

SHOT of Sheriffs talking. We can't hear them because of the
machine.

CLOSEUP - FREDDY

CLOSEUP - FREDDY'S HANDS

CLOSEUP - GERMAN SHEPHERD

He barks. We can't hear him because of the machine. Machine
turns off. Freddy turns and walks out of the room.

BACK TO BAR

CLOSEUP - JOE

JOE
(laughing)
That's how you do it, kid. You knew
how to handle that situation. You
shit your pants, and then you just
dive in and swim.

IN SLOW MOTION Joe lights a cigar.

HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
Tell me more about Cabot.

He's a cool guy. A real nice, real
funny, real cool guy.

FREDDY
Do you remember "The Fantastic Four"?

HOLDAYWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
The Thing. The motherfucker looks
just like The Thing.

INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSEUP - TELEPHONE

It RINGS. Freddy answers it, we FOLLOW the receiver up to
his face.

FREDDY
Hello.

NICE GUY EDDIE (O.S.)

It's time. Grab your jacket -

INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

CLOSEUP - Nice Guy Eddie speaking into the car phone.

EDDIE
We're parked outside.

FREDDY (O.S.)
(through phone)
I'll be right down.

We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone.
Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.

EDDIE
He'll be right down.

INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment
getting everything he needs. He puts on his jacket and slips
on some sneakers.

DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand comes
into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE UP to his
face.

Fear.

FREDDY
(to himself)
Don't pussy out on me now. They don't
know. They don't know shit.
(pause)
You're not gonna get hurt. You're
fucking Baretta and they believe
every word, cuz you're super cool.

He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and close
OFF SCREEN.

EXT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

COPS' POV

From inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO COPS
watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and up to
Eddie's parked car.

COP #1 (O.S.)
There goes our boy.

COP #2 (O.S.)
I swear, a guy has to have rocks in
his head the size of Gibraltar to
work undercover.

COP #1 (O.S.)
Do you want one of these?

COP #2 (O.S.)
Yeah, gimme the bear claw.

Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.

INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is in the
passenger seat. Freddy and Mr. White are in the backseat
together.

MR. PINK
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about,
black women ain't the same as white
women.

MR. WHITE
(sarcastically)
There's a slight difference.

The car laughs.

MR. PINK
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I
mean. What a while bitch will put up
with, a black bitch won't put up
with for a minute. They got a line,
and if you cross it, they fuck you
up.

EDDIE
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
this. I've seen it happen.

MR. WHITE
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a
truism, how come every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of
shit?

MR. PINK
I'll make you a bet that those same
damn niggers who were showin' their
ass in public, when their bitches
get 'em home, they chill the fuck
out.

MR. WHITE
Not these guys.

MR. PINK
Yeah, those guys too.

EDDIE
Let me tell you guys a story. In one
of daddy's clubs there was this black
cocktail waitress named Elois.

MR. WHITE
Elois?

EDDIE
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called
her Lady E.

MR. WHITE
Where was she from, Compton?

EDDIE
No. She was from Ladora Heights.

MR. PINK
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this
lady from Ladora Heights once.
(in a stuck up black
female voice)
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
the black Beverly Hills."

EDDIE
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway,
this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-
upper. I bet every guy who's ever
met her has jacked off to her at
least once. You know who she looked
like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV
show "Get Christie Love"? She was a
black female cop. She always used to
say "You're under arrest, sugar."

MR. PINK
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on. I totally dug it. What
the fuck was the name of the chick
who played Christie Love?

EDDIE
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier
was the other one. Pam Grier made
the movies. Christie Love was like a
Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
What the fuck was that chick's name?
Oh this is just great, I'm totally
fuckin' tortured now.

EDDIE
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked
like her. So one night I walk into
the club, and no Elois. Now the
bartender was a wetback, he was a
friend of mine, his name was Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's
Lady E tonight?" Well apparently
Lady E was married to this real piece
of dog shit. I mean a real animal.
And apparently he would so things to
her.

FREDDY
Do things? What would he do? You
mean like beat her up?

EDDIE
Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something. Anyway,
Elois plays it real cool. And waits
for the next time this bag of shit
gets drunk. So one night the guy
gets drunk and passes out on the
couch. So while the guy's inebriated,
she strips him naked. Then she takes
some crazy glue and glues his dick
to his belly.

The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

EDDIE
I'm dead fuckin' serious. She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together. The
paramedics had to come and cut it
loose.

The car reacts badly.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!

FREDDY
You can do some crazy things with
it.

EDDIE
I don't know what he did to her, but
she got even.

MR. WHITE
Was he all pissed off?

MR. PINK
How would you feel if you had to do
a handstand every time you took a
piss.

The car laughs.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

JOE
You guys like to tell jokes and giggle
and kid around, huh? Giggling like a
bunch of young broads in a school
yard. Well, let me tell a joke.

CAMERA TRACKS ACROSS men's faces.

JOE
Five guys sitting in a bull pen, San
Quentin. Wondering how the fuck they
got there. What'd we wrong? What
should we've done? What didn't we
do? It's your fault, my fault, his
fault. All that bullshit. Finally,
someone comes up with the idea, wait
a minute, while we were planning
this caper, all we did was sit around
and tell fuckin' jokes. Got the
message? When this caper's over, and
I'm sure it's gonna be a successful
one, hell, we'll go down to the
Hawaiian Island and I'll roar and
laugh with all of you. You'll find
me a different character down there.
Right now it's a matter of business.
With the exception of Eddie and
myself, who you already know, you'll
be using aliases. Under no
circumstances are you to tell one
another your real name or anything
else about yourself. That includes
where you're from, your wife's name,
where you might've done time, about
a bank in St. Petersburg you might've
robbed. You guys don't say shit about
who you are, where you been or what
you've done. Only thing you guys can
talk about is what you're going to
do. This way the only ones who know
who the members of the team are Eddie
and myself. And that's the way I
like it. Because in the unlikely
event of one of you getting
apprehended by the cops, not that I
expect that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with. You don't
know any names. You know my name,
you know Eddie's name. That I don't
care about. You gotta prove it. I
ain't worried. Besides, this way you
gotta trust me. I like that. I set
this up and picked the men I wanted
for it. None of you came to me, I
approached all of you. I know you. I
know your work, I know your
reputation. I know you as men. Except
for this guy.

Joe points a finger at Freddy.

Freddy shits a brick.

JOE
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he
wouldn't be here. Okay, let me
introduce everybody to everybody.
But once again, at the risk of being
redundant, if I even think I hear
somebody telling or referring to
somebody by their Christian name...
(Joe searches for the
right words)
...you won't want to be you. Okay,
quickly.
(pointing at the men
as he gives them a
name)
Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.

MR. PINK
Why am I Mr. Pink?

JOE
Cause you're a faggot, alright?

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Why can't we pick out our own colors?

JOE
I tried that once, it don't work.
You get four guys fighting over who's
gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody
knows anybody else, nobody wants to
back down. So forget it, I pick. Be
thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.

MR. BROWN
Yeah, but Mr. Brown? That's too close
to Mr. Shit.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy.
Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple.
That sounds good to me, I'm Mr.
Purple.

JOE
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from
another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr.
Pink.

MR. WHITE
Who cares what your name is? Who
cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple,
Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

MR. PINK
Oh that's really easy for you to
say, you're Mr. White. You gotta
cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr.
White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no
big deal, you wanna trade?

JOE
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look,
this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city
counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink.
We got two ways here, my way or the
highway. And you can go down either
of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr.
Pink?

MR. PINK
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget
it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink,
let's move on.

CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the
layout of the jewelry store on it.

JOE
I'll move on, when I feel like it.
All you guys got the goddamn message?
I'm so goddamn mad I can hardly talk.
Let's go to work.

CUT TO:

EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY

We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on customers
through the windows.

While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr. White
and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

MR. WHITE (V.O.)
Let's go over it. Where are you?

FREDDY (V.O.)
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody come in or go
out.

MR. WHITE (V.O.)
Mr. Brown?

FREDDY (V.O.)
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's
parked across the street till I give
him the signal, then he pulls up in
front of the store.

MR. WHITE (V.O.)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

FREDDY (V.O.)
Crowd control. They handle customers
and employees in the display area.

INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.

MR. WHITE
Myself and Mr. Pink?

FREDDY
You two take the manager in the back
and make him give you the diamonds.
We're there for those stones, period.
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go
off. We're out of there in two
minutes, not one second longer. What
if the manager won't give up the
diamonds?

MR. WHITE
When you're dealing with a store
like this, they're insured up the
ass. They're not supposed to give
you and resistance whatsoever. If
you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson,
take the butt of your gun and smash
their nose in. Drops 'em right to
the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls
down, screaming, blood squirts out
his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody
says fuckin' shit after that. You
might get some bitch talk shit to
ya. But give her a look, like you're
gonna smash her in the face next.
Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if
it's a manager, that's a different
story. The managers know better than
to fuck around. So if one's givin'
you static, he probably thinks he's
a real cowboy. So what you gotta do
is break that son-of-a-bitch in two.
If you wanna know something and he
won't tell you, cut off one of his
fingers. The little one. Then you
tell 'im his thumb's next. After
that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies
underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a
taco.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

It's the moment of the robbery. The alley is empty.

In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose. Guns FIRING,
people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING, glass
BREAKING...

A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

Freddy opens the driver's side door. A bloody SCREAMING Mr.
Brown FALLS out.

MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes! My eyes! I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!

FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just blood
in your eyes.

Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics. He RUNS to the end
of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the patrol
car.

Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr. White's
ambush in shock.

Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange? You're Mr. Orange, aren't
you?

By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown is
dead.

Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

MR. WHITE
Is he dead?

Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

MR. WHITE
Did he did or not?

Freddy, scared.

FREDDY
I'm sorry.

MR. WHITE
What? Snap out of it!

Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as he
RUNS.

They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car. He points his
gun at her.

MR. WHITE
Get us outta here!

Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

Freddy starts to climb in.

The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

MR. WHITE
The bitch's got a gun!

She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.

CLOSEUP - FREDDY

As he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened to him
and what he's done. SLOW MOTION.

Mr. White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car. He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.

INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is CRYING.

We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car. Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

MR. WHITE (O.S.)
Just hold on buddy boy.

FREDDY
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed
me...

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr.
Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.

We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot
full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody
mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound.
Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot.

EDDIE
What the fuck happened here?

Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde / Toothpick Vic.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Orange)
What happened?

MR. ORANGE
(very weakly)
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and was
gonna burn him alive.

EDDIE
(yelling)
Who cares what he was gonna do to
this fuckin' pig?

Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and the
chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once
more.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that? Worse or better?

MR. ORANGE
Look, Eddie, he was pullin' a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through the
door, he was gonna blow you to hell
and make off with the diamonds.

MR. WHITE
(to Eddie)
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That
sick piece of shit was a stone cold
psycho.

MR. ORANGE
(to Eddie)
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him. He talked about
what he was going to do when he was
slicing him up.

EDDIE
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.

MR. WHITE
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to
me. Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.

Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

MR. PINK
He's right about the ear, it's hacked
off.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind. According
to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill
you. Then when we came back, kill
us, grab the diamonds, and scram.
That's your story? I'm correct about
that, right?

MR. ORANGE
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth. I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
that's what happened.

The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of Nice Guy Eddie.

There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has
said. Finally:

EDDIE
The man you killed was just released
from prison. He got caught at a
company warehouse full of hot items.
He could've walked away. All he had
to do was say my dad's name. But
instead he shut his mouth and did
his time. He did four years for us,
and he did 'em like a man. And we
were very grateful. So, Mr. Orange,
you're tellin' me this very good
friend of mine, who did four years
for my father, who in four years
never made a deal, no matter what
they dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
man is free, and we're making good
on our commitment to him, he's just
gonna decide, right out of the fuckin'
blue, to rip us off?

Silence.

EDDIE
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
what really happened?

VOICE (O.S.)
Why? It'll just be more bullshit.

Eddie steps out of his CLOSEUP and we see Joe Cabot standing
in the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.

JOE
(pointing to Mr. Orange)
This man set us up.

CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's
happening.

JOE
That's okay, Eddie, I do.

MR. WHITE
(to Joe)
What the fuck are you talking about?

JOE
(pointing to Mr. Orange)
That piece of shit. Workin' with the
cops.

MR. WHITE, MR. PINK & EDDIE
What?

JOE
I said this lump of shit is workin'
with the LAPD.

MR. ORANGE'S POV

Looking up from the floor at everybody.

Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

JOE
Aren't you?

MR. ORANGE (O.S.)
I don't have the slightest fuckin'
idea what you're talkin' about.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly to Joe)
Joe, I don't know what you think you
know, but you're wrong.

JOE
Like hell I am.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly)
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a
mistake. He's a good kid. I understand
you're hot, you're super-fuckin'
pissed. We're all real emotional.
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know this man, and he wouldn't do
that.

JOE
You don't know jack shit. I do. This
rotten bastard tipped off the cops
and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blue's dead?

JOE
Dead as Dillinger.

EDDIE
The motherfucker killed Vic.

MR. WHITE
How do you know all this?

JOE
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred
percent on. I should have my fucking
head examined for goin' forward when
I wasn't a hundred percent. But he
seemed like a good kid, and I was
impatient and greedy and all the
things that fuck you up.

MR. WHITE
(screaming)
That's your proof?

JOE
You don't need proof when you got
instinct. I ignored it before, but
not no more.

He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms.

Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

EDDIE
Have you lost your fucking mind? Put
your gun down!

Mr. Pink fades into the b.g., wanting no part of this.

MR. WHITE
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake
I can't let you make.

EDDIE
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at
daddy!

Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

JOE
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry
have been friends a long time, he
ain't gonna shoot. We like each other
too much.

MR. WHITE
Joe, if you kill that man, you die
next. Repeat, if you kill that man,
you die next!

We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.

MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange. Not taking his eyes off
him.

Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to start
firing any minute.

Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr. White.

Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

Nobody says nothing.

FOUR SHOT of guys ready for violence. Mr. Pink in the
background.

MR. PINK
C'mon, guys, nobody wants this. We're
supposed to me fuckin' professionals!

Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

JOE
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

MR. WHITE
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
this!

JOE
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on
this.

MR. WHITE
Don't ask me that.

JOE
I'm not askin', I'm betting.

Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Daddy, don't!

Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his hands
up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
chest.

Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

Joe's dead.

Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest heaving.
The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees, not
moving.

Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the satchel
of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP, MEN
RUNNING to the warehouse.

While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange lies.

He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
stroking his brow.

MR. WHITE
(with much effort)
Sorry, kid. Looks like we're gonna
do a little time.

Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an effort:

MR. ORANGE
I'm a cop.

Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
brow.

MR. ORANGE
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
Orange's eyes.

The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME CLOSEUP of Mr. White.

The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see anything,
but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

POLICE FORCE (O.S.)
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop your
fucking gun!

Mr. White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

BANG!

We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.

FADE OUT:

THE END

I

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
skin off ankles.

AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
Greenville Auction.

DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
unknown, never to be seen again.

As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
for forty.

WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.

The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
of the auction block.









2

DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
(their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
buy Niggers, who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.

BACK TO DJANGO
walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
end.


/--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
their black skinned cargo forward.
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
fur collars.

WHEN...
.A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
rifles for possible trouble.

A BLACK HORSE
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

THE RIDER
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
hat on his head.

DICKY SPECK
Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
State your business, or prepare to get
winged!

THE RIDER
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

THE RIDER
(to the Slavers)
Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves)
Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
slave traders that go by the'name of
The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

ACE SPECK
Who wants to. know?

THE RIDER
I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
is my horse, Fritz.
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
him.

DICKY SPECK
You a doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Affirmative.

DICKY SPECK
What kinda doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

ACE SPECK
So what?









LE
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, I wish to parley with you.

ACE SPECK
Speak English!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
second language. Amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe, is a specimen
I'm keen to acquire.
(to the slaves)
Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
you, who was formerly a resident of
The Carrucan Plantation?
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
VOICE rings out;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

DJANGO
Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
amazing name - during your time at the
Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
three overseers by the name of The Brittle
Brothers?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz is delighted.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

DJANGO
Dem da Brittle Brothers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So Django, do you think you could recognize -
ï¿½. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.









ACE SPECK
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like what?

ACE SPEC
Like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

ACE SPECK
Speak English, goddamit!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

ACE SPECK
I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

ACE SPECK
Move it!
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, did you simply get carried away
with your dramatic gesture, or are you
pointing that weapon at me with lethal
intention...?

ACE SPECK
Last chance, fancy pants
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Very well -
The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
.BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.








Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
direction...

BAM...
Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
.The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
Dicky's body.

DICKY SPECK
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
Dr.SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

(COUNTING OUT

THE SLAVES)
.one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

DICKY SPECK
My damn legs busted!
Dr.SCHULTZ
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

(TO DJANGO)
As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
recognize them?

DJANGO
Yes.








Dr.SCHULTZ
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I can point 'em out.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
Django?

DICKY SPECK
I'm gonna lose this leg!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, unless you find a talented physician
very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
end result. But back to business, how much
do you want for Django?

DICKY SPECK
You go to hell!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be silly. How much for Django?

DICKY SPECK
800 dollars!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.

The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
young Django here.
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
Django is free.
Dr.SCHULTZ
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
Dicky just curses him.
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
(as he writes)
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops, then
says to Django)
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
is it not?









9

DJANGO
Huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not..
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
way it looks.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
mark here.
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
leg irons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
Or ...
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;









0
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, it's not so difficult.

EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

DJANGO
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your horse?

DJANGO
What horse?
Dr.SCHULTZ'
The horse you're riding.

DJANGO
This ain't my horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is.

DJANGO
No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
it.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
congratulations.









/1

DJANGO
I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
up in no stable.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRUSTRATED)
Don't worry about all that!
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
then says with a smile;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
couldn't do without him.
(he pats Fritz's neck)
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -

DJANGO
- Tony.
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Tony what?

DJANGO
- I dunno, Tony the horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
Tony?

DJANGO
Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
Why Tony?

DJANGO
I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
tell ya.
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

TEXAS"









/Z
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.

EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
million other visitors.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's everybody staring at?

DJANGO
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's this bizarre obsession they have
with. you not riding horses?

DJANGO
You askin' me?
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So what other archaic rituals are you people
verboten to take part in?
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?

DJANGO
Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What part would they find the most offensive?









13

DJANGO
All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

DJANGO
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case Django, after you.

DJANGO
Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time
like the,present."
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
establishment.

INT - SALOON - MORNING
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
away from the two patrons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
weary travelers.

SALOON KEEPER
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
for about a hour. But by then we'll be
servin' breakfast -
He turns around and sees them.

SALOON KEEPER
Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
get that nigger outta here.









IT

TIME CUT

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
and that would fall under the domain of the
Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

DJANGO
What kinda dentist are you?
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

HE EXPLAINS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
deals in corpses.









15
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
the bounty.
(lifting his beer)
Cheers.
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

DJANGO
What's a bounty?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's like a reward.

DJANGO
You kill people and they give you a reward?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Certain people, yes.

DJANGO
White people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

DJANGO
Bad people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
work to my benefit.

(BEAT)
Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?









1G

ï¿½. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I know what they look like, all right.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
with me till we find them -

DJANGO
- Where we goin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you
your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
I've already gave him to you -- but once the
final Brittle brother lies dead in the
dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
included.
Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

SHERIFF SHARP
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;









1 2

SHERIFF SHARP
Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
and show your ass -
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

.THEN...
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

PEDESTRIAN
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
skull, killing him dead.
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now you can go get the marshall.

TIME CUT

EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

MARSHALL TATUM
Move that buckboard over there long ways
across the street from the saloon. And I
want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this
roof, and two men with two rifles on that
roof, with all barrels pointed at that
front door. And somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.









LP
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

WHEN...

COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

INT - SALOON - DAY
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
on the window.
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What are they doing?

DJANGO
I think they wonderin' why you playin'
the piana'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good.

(PAUSE)
But what are they doing?

DJANGO
A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
around out front, now they hidin' behind it
with guns. And a buncha other white folks
are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
down here.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
marshall out there?

DJANGO
If the one I think is the.marshall is the
marshall, he's out there.









)9
Dr.SCHULTZ
What makes you think he's the marshall?

DJANGO
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
You in the saloon!
Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
We got eleven Winchesters on every way
outta that buildin'! You got once chance
git outta this alive! You and your nigger
come out right now with your hands over
your head, and I mean, right now!
Dr.SCHULTZ
First things first! Is this the marshall
I have the pleasure of addressing?

MARSHALL TATUM
Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the
criminal justice system of The United
States of America, I shant be shot down
in the street, by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.

MARSHALL TATUM
You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
'em down like a dog in the street!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
have your word as a lawman not to shoot
me down like a dog in the street?

MARSHALL TATUM
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
cheat the hangman in my town!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!








Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
They're a little tense out there. So don't
make any quick movements, and let me do
the talking.
Django looks at him like, "as if..."

EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
outside.

MARSHALL TATUM
You unarmed?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
address you, your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
incident that just occurred?

MARSHALL TATUM
Go on!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
to elect as their sheriff, who went by
the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his head of two hundred
dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
or alive.

MARSHALL TATUM
The hell you say!
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
news. But I'm willing to wager this man
was elected sheriff sometime in the last
two years. I know this because. three years
ago he was rustling cattle from,
The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock Texas.









Z/
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
In my possession. is a warrant made out by
circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am, and who your
dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In other words marshall, you owe me
two hundred dollars.

CUT TO

EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
times. A man who survives, is a man with
a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
a good plan. So, having said that, what's
your plan, young Django?

DJANGO
What'cha mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, after this Brittle business is behind
us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?

DJANGO
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of
matrimony seriously?

DJANGO
Huh?









ZZ
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do slaves believe in marriage'?

DJANGO
Me and my wife do.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where is she now?

DJANGO
I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days 'fore me.
But I don't know who to.
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Care for some jerky?

DJANGO
Sure.
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

SCHULTZ SAYS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
where she is?
A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
the dilemma, then pronounces;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen?

DJANGO
A few months ago.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Three or four?

DJANGO
Three.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
monthsago?
Django nods his head, yes.









Z3
Dr.SCHULTZ
The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in
Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
visit. Free or not.

DJANGO
I'll have my freedom papers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes you will. But say you show them to some
rascals, and they take them from you and
tear them up?

DJANGO
They could do that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not saying they would, but they could.

DJANGO
They do that I'll kill 'em.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
man. The point being is the place,is just
too dangerous for you.

DJANGO
Well I gotta go, when do I go?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you get more dangerous.

EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the
stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's
wearing explains the distress.

DJANGO
is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that
wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
Versailles.
Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
you can never break character.

CUT TO

EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
at the darkee on the horse.

SPENCER BENNETT
It's against the law for niggers to ride
horses in this territory.
Dr.SCHULTZ
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

SPENCER BENNETT
I said niggers -








Z .ate`
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.

SPENCER BENNETT
Not on my.property, around my niggers
he can't.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
valet, Django, and these are our horses,
Fritz, and Tony.
Fritz, does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
are a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that we've
ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
with you now.

SPENCER BENNETT
State your business.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I wish to purchase one of your
nigger gals.

SPENCER BENNETT
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
no appointment, no nuttin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm afraid so.

SPENCER BENNETT
Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
say about that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things I might say,
that could change your mind.
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
Spencer laughs.









ZG

SPENCER BENNETT
C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

SPENCER
Absolutely. Betina!
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
BETINA, snaps to attention.

BETINA
Yes sir, Big Daddy?

SPENCER

(TO SCHULTZ)
What's your Jimmies name again?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django.

SPENCER
Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

BETINA
As you please, Big Daddy.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.

SPENCER
Understood., Schultz. Betina?

BETINA
Yes, sir?

SPENCER
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?









BETINA
Ya want I should treat 'em like white
folks?

SPENCER
No that's not what I said.

BETINA
Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Yes, I can see that.

(HE THINKS)
What's the name of that peckawood boy from
town works with the glass? His mama works
at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
the winda's when we have a problem?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
Oh, you mean Jerry.

SPENCER
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

(TO BETINA)
You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

BETINA
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Well that's it then... just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.

EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

BETINA
What'cha do for your massa'?

DJANGO
Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

BETINA
So you really free?

DJANGO
Yes.









ZY

BETINA
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Django fumes.

EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
lemonade.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've been'told by those who should know,
the most exquisite African flesh in the
state of Tennessee is bred right here on
your land. And from the look of these
black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

SPENCER
Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
field. But the lion share of my lady
niggers are real show pony's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
pony for young Django. So the only
question that remains is, do you have a
nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

SPENCER
Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
is practically my middle name.

BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

DJANGO
Betina, come over here, I need to ask
you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

BETINA
What'cho want?

DJANGO
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
brothers. Overseers. Their name is
Brittle. Do you know 'em?

BETINA
Brittle?









DJANGO
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

BETINA
I don't know dem.

DJANGO
They could be usin' a different name.
They woulda' come to the plantation in
the last year.

BETINA
You mean The Shaffer's?

DJANGO
Maybe? Three brother?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Are they here?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Can you point one of 'em out to me?

BETINA
Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
field landscape.

SPYGLASS POV:
Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
observation.

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
he lowers the glass.

BETINA

(INNOCENTLY)
Is that who you lookin' for?

DJANGO
Yep.
He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

DJANGO
Where's the other two?

BETINA.
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
for breakin' eggs.

DJANGO
They whippin' Little Jody?
She nods her head, yes.

DJANGO
Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

BETINA
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

DJANGO
Go git that white man, I came here with.
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
and The Brittle Brothers.

FLASH ON
A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

BULLWHIP.
DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.









3/

DJANGO
Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
She's real sorry!
The WHIP RIPS her back.

DJANGO

(SCREAMING)
Goddamit, Big John!

LITTLE RAJ
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
Brittle with everything he has.

BACK TO DJANGO
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

FLASH ON
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

KNEELING DJANGO;

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
I like the way you beg, boy.

EXT - STABLE - DAY
Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
are clumsy. You'd break everything in
goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
only known cure for nigger clumsiness
is a peelin'.
Little Jody begs to differ.

BACK TO DJANGO
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
little dogs no nevermind.









3 2-

BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

BIG JOHN
After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

DJANGO
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

WHEN ...
.DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

DJANGO
John Brittle!
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.

LITTLE RAJ
Django?
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
shake his hand ...

DJANGO
Remember me?
.Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

BIG JOHN FACE
goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
heart, at Django.

DJANGO
I like the way you die, boy.









3 3
Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
It goes off... BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.

DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Who are they?

DJANGO
That's John Brittle, and that's his
little brother Raj.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where's Ellis?

DJANGO
He's the one hightailin' it across that
field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
to make an escape.

SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you sure that's him?
Ellis gets further away...









DJANGO
Yes!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I dunno.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't know if you're positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I don't know what, positive,'means.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It means you're sure.

DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, what?

DJANGO
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

BAM!
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

SPENCER
Just who the hell are you two jokers?









35;
Drï¿½. SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
Roger Brittle --

DJANGO
- They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
.Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
paper.

SPENCER
Gimmie.
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
what it says.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I have that back?









36
,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We good?

BENNETT
Get off my land.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Post haste.

(TO DJANGO)
Load up the bodies as quickly as
you can, and let's get out of
here.

TIME CUT
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
for one final threat.

BENNETT
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
while you on my property. But for lettin' a
nigger kill a white man, and especially for
letting a nigger kill a white man in a
audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
it out of the county alive. Mark my words
Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
from my motherfuckin' gate.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
regulator playmates aren't shy about
killing for what you believe in. But mark
my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
towards Django or myself, you better be
prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

lying on his belly in the grass.

SPENCER BENNETT
That's them sonsabitches.

SPENCER'S POV:
We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
steed..

SPENCER BENNETT
Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
personally, strip and clip that garboon
myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

SPENCER BENNETT
Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

BRADSHAW
We ready, or what?

Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

Randy tears at his bag.

RANDY
Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He puts it on-then says;

RANDY
Yep, it's worse.
He yanks it off his head.

RANDY
Did anybody bring any extra bags?

TERRY
No, no one brought a extra bag!

RANDY
I'm just asking.

DOUG
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

SPENCER
Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.
Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

REDFISH
I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

WILLARD
Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched

And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
Willard rides off.
O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

SPENCER
O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,

O.B.
But Willards riding off.

SPENCER
Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

RANDY
Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;

ROBERT
I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
Everyone takes off their bag.

SPENCER
Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!









YO

TERRY
But nobody can see.

SPENCER
So?

TERRY
So, it would be nice to see.

SPENCER
Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
"Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
Then amongst the confusion...

WE SNAP ZOOM TO

on the other side of the lake
Then quickly cut into The Tree.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
dogs.

we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet,
RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.

DJANGO

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER BENNETT
falls from his horse, dead.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to
Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like that, huh?
Referring to the scope sight rifle;

DJANGO
I like.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, I think while they take this opportunity
to lick their wounds, we should take this
opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
They hop out of the tree.

MONTAGE
Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his
first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
his winter coat.









EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside
the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
Dr.SCHULTZ
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

DJANGO
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?
Dr.SCHULTZ
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?

DJANGO
Broomhilda.
Schultz reacts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda?
Django.nods his head yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Were her owners German?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

DJANGO
Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
speak a little German too.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your wife?

DJANGO
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is
Broomhilda Von Shaft...?









DJANGO
Yep. Mouthful, huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To say the least.
(stopping the horse)
This looks like a very pretty place to have
our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

TIME CUT

EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
cup of tea.

DJANGO
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
were German?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

DJANGO
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
all the German legends.

DJANGO
Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes there is.

DJANGO
Do you know it?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Every German knows that story. Would you
like me to tell you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

DJANGO
What she do.?








Dr.SCHULTZ
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
obliterate her -

DJANGO
Obliterate... . what does that mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.

DJANGO
Phew, that's pretty mad.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

DJANGO
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.

DJANGO
Does a fella arise?
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
named, Sigfried.

DJANGO
Does Sigfried save her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
he's not afraid.of him.








Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
He walks through hellfire because
Broomhilda's worth. it.
After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
as they nibble on their sandwiches.

DJANGO
I know how he feels.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
thinks about what he's going to say next.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question, how do you like
the bounty hunting business?

DJANGO
Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
What's not to like?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hafta admit, we make a good team.

DJANGO
But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
Big John and Rodger?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
overzealous. But normally, that's a good
thing. How'd you like to partner up for
the winter?

DJANGO
What'd ya mean partner up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
for the winter.

DJANGO
You makin' another agreement?









W7
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes. You work with me through the winter,
till the snow melts. I give you a third
of my bounties. And while we're together,
I'll teach you a few things you're going
to need to know.

DJANGO
Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
head bow thing that Fritz can do?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That among other things. We make some
money this winter, when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.
I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
understandably, he's a little suspicious.

DJANGO
Why you care what happens to me? Why you
care if I find my wife?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well frankly, I've never given anybody
their freedom before. And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
just not ready to go off on your own, it's
that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
obliged to help you on your quest to
rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
Django accepts that response.
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

WE SEE
A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
to be good at this.

EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.









Y, 8

DOWN BELOW WE SEE
A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
helping him by leading the horse forward.
On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Keep down or he'll see you.

DJANGO
Who that farmer? Who cares?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
just might.

DJANGO
What? The little man pushin' that plow?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
who's hiding out as a farmer, because
there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
his head.
He hands Django the scope rifle case.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And he's all yours my boy.
DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV:
on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
and his son.
Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
folks for money?

DJANGO
His son's with him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
Maybe even share a last word. That's
better then most get, and a damn. sight
better then he deserves.









1Ï¿½9
Django still hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

DJANGO

(READING)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

(REFERRING TO

THE HANDBILL)
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
You want to save your wife by doing what
I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
is worth seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
Django SHOOTS.
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

DJANGO
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's good luck. You always keep the
handbill of your first bounty.
They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
leading the extra body horse behind them.









50
As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
last words to his son before he dies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, they're having a tender little father son
moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
they've ever had.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
heart would be.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the bottle heart!
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the left coal eye.
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the right coal eye.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the carrot nose.
Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think it's safe to say you're faster then
the snowman.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

FROM ABOVE.

DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
with five corpses.









571
The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

SHERIFF GUS
Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
and who the hell ya got there?
Dr.SCHULTZ
The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

SHERIFF GUS
Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
it down to the friendly peace officer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
And three of their acolytes.

SHERIFF GUS
Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
"That one", Schultz says.
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
practices his fast draw against five men...
.by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.









5L
As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You're pretty confident aren't you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You have reason to be.
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
top of Django.

DJANGO
Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh you're ready for Greenville.
He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
sure.
He blows out the match...

WE GO TO BLACK
What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

"FLASHDANCE")

MISSISSIPPI

CUT TO

EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.









53
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
along.
BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

THE KIDS ALONG.
Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

GREENVILLE

CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
Greenville operates.
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

WE FLASH ON
The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

JUDD
Good god almighty these niggers stink!









I F

RUSS
Niggers stink, where's the shock?
(to the Slaves

BELOW)
Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
well, I'm only gonna say this once.
There's a slave corral right across from
this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
niggers better comprehend. And that goes for
any African garboons amongst y'all can't
understand english ... . your American buddies
better shove your ass in the right direction,
or your trip to this country is going to be
short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
you can!
The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

INSIDE THE CORRAL
through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
view.
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
LADIES, then she's gone from view.

BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)
Django and Dr.Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of
Greenville.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a spectacle out of Dante.

DJANGO
You should see it from the other side.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

DJANGO
You'd be surprised what you can endure.

(BEAT)
Where to?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Records office.

CUT TO

INT - RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words
routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.

BLACK TITLE CARD:

BROOMHILDA

INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
Street.
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

BROOMHILDA
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.








Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
he nudges his dad.
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
branded in her cheek.
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

SELLER - CLYDE
Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
nigger gal gentle.

UGLY MAN
makes a bid.

BROOMHILDA
yikes.

UGLIER MAN

Mr.Harmony makes a bid for his son Scotty.
Broomhilda notices that. And makes more eye contact with Scotty.
They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.









NARRATOR (VO)
On that day, eight months ago, the auction
was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
for his fat boy son Scotty.
Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

SCOTTY
This is for you.
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

SCOTTY
They're jelly beans. Try one.
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

SCOTTY
Good huh?
She nods her head, yes.
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
back eating her bag of jelly beans.

$XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
realize the young master is the shy type.

BROOMHILDA
Master Scotty... ?

SCOTTY
Yes Broomhilda?

BROOMHILDA
I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
you on that seat so we can talk?

SCOTTY
Please, I'd love that.
She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.









'8

EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
his new bought nigger gal.
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
Mrs.HARMONY
What's your name, gal?

BROOMHILDA
Broomhilda.
Mrs.HARMONY
Follow me. into the kitchen,
('to her son)
You stay out here.

INT - KITCHEN - DAY
Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
Mrs.HARMONY
I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
with him, they fool with him for the wrong
reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
wrong, you'll deal with me.

BROOMHILDA
I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
needs is a little confidence.
Mrs.HARMONY
And you'll give that to him?

BROOMHILDA
I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
Mrs.HARMONY
He is, isn't he?

BROOMHILDA
Ah-huh.
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

NARRATOR (VO)
Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
bride for young master Scotty that day.
And the two kids had a nice time playing
house for awhile.
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
the daytime..
At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

NARRATOR (VO)
As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
even join the family at their dinner table.
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
gravy.

NARRATOR.(VO)
And pretty soon she was adopted into a
member of the family.
Mrs.Harmony and Broomhilda sewing together.
The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard.
After dinner, Mrs.Harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano.
Mr.Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook.

NARRATOR (VO)
Scotty was never happier.
Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour.
Broomhilda having sex with Scotty, baby talking with him, talking him
through it, making him feel loved and secure.

NARRATOR (VO)
After three months of this bliss,
Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
a romantic weekend in Greenville.

SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
described as plantation pimp daddy.









6O

NARRATOR (VO)
White masters would take their pretty
Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
how bad the other slaves had it, always made
the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
position, (just in case they'd forgot).

BROOMHILDA
holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

INSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY
Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the
registry book that indicates darkee female companion.

INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

NARRATOR (VO)
And two, there was a sliver of society that
ran through Greenville at night that catered
to white masters who were infected with a
condition that was normally referred to as,
"Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

private club called, The Cleopatra Club.

But the crown jewel of all this interracial
frivolity, was the members only, Cleopatra
Club.

INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
white men and black women).
Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
room.
We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
I love you. And if loving you means I go to
hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

NARRATOR (VO)
Then... speak of the devil and the devil
appears.

CALVIN CANDIE
appears at their table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
to welcome an attractive couple'like
yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

SCOTTY
Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
We love it here.
Pointing at a empty chair.

CALVIN CANDIE
May I join you?-

SCOTTY
Please, by all means.
Calvin sits down.
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long have you been a member?









SCOTTY
We just joined this weekend.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well our little private oasis appreciates
your patronage. Some may consider the dues
excessive, but they're necessary for us to
create this haven for the alternative
lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

SCOTTY
Well said, and money well spent.
He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
Candie sees this.

CALVIN CANDIE
It would be.my pleasure, your first
weekend at the club, to join me and my
friends at my table.
Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
with a, "Don't be silly."
We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
join the party.
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
is a little more revealing then the others.
They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

NARRATOR (VO)
After excusing herself, she walked across
the street to her hotel room. She got
her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
scrape every pimple.

ï¿½-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

NARRATOR (VO)
Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
card game. As the game wore on, it came down
to a two thousand dollar pot between
Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
something in his ear.

CANDIE

(TO SHEBA)
Really?

(TO SCOTTY)
You know what Sheba just tole me?
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

SCOTTY
What?

CANDIE
She says she thinks you're cute.

SCOTTY
Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
beautiful.
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

CANDIE
Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
lip. Want some lip?
Scotty, is a little surprised.

SCOTTY
Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

CANDIE
Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
Calvin's side of the table.
The game continues.









G

CANDIE
Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
it. If you're really holding cards, time to
pony up. I raise you five hundred.
Candie throws in his chips.

SCOTTY.
I see your five hundred...
(throws in chips)
.and raise you four hundred more.
(tosses his last chips)
Call.
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.

CALVIN CANDIE
Not so fast, boy.

(BEAT)
Pot ain't fat enough yet.

SCOTTY
I'm all in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ain't that too bad.
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

SCOTTY
I would think a southern gentleman of
such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

CALVIN CANDIE
One final raise.
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

CALVIN CANDIE
It's Sheba's bill of sale.

SCOTTY
What? I don't want her.
Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

CALVIN CANDIE
You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
More laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
In Greenville slaves are currency. And
Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
fold?

SCOTTY
I'm all out of money.

CALVIN CANDIE
But we ain't playin' for money no more..
We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
you got.

SCOTTY
I can't bet Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
and a pencil.
Somebody does.

CALVIN CANDIE
Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
Scotty makes a pressured decision.
He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
Let me see your cards!
Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

SCOTTY
You cheated me.
After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
What did you just call me?

SCOTTY
I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
cause that's what you are!
Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
himself .









66
Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
I challenge you to a duel.
(to the Piano

PLAYER)
Piano player, will you hit three separate
notes?

(TO SCOTTY)
On the third note, pick up the gun and
try to kill me.
(to Piano player)
Piano player please ...
This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

SCOTTY
Wait a minute ...no!

FIRST NOTE ...

SCOTTY
I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
to duel!

CALVIN CANDIE
Then get out of here, get in your buggy
and get out of town.

SCOTTY
Sure. Let me just get my girl.

CALVIN CANDIE
You lost that girl, fat boy.

SECOND NOTE...

SCOTTY
Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
give you Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
to fuckin' another one.

(BEAT)
Or pick up that gun.
Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
leave.

THIRD NOTE...
Calvin Candie SHOOTS Scotty Harmony dead.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Calvin Candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the

FRONT DESK CLERK..

CALVIN CANDLE
Hello Oliver.

FRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER)
Hello Mr.Candie, good evening.

CALVIN CANDLE
Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver.
Could you please inform me which room
your guest Scott Harmony is staying in?

INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Broomhilda is asleep in bed...

WHEN ...
.Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand. He
YANKS OFF the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under. Broomhilda lies
naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her legs and
backside.
She hops out of bed.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the stairs,
down the stairs, and through the lobby, and out the front door.
All to the amusement of the WHITE HOTEL GUESTS.

EXT - GREENVILLE HOTEL - NIGHT
She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE
GREENVILLE MUD. She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie looking
down at her.

CALVIN CANDIE
Welcome to Candyland.
We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face.

That was four months ago.

CUT TO

INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold
fill the big hall.

ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
stands half naked on the auction block.
The SELLER' (SHELBY)
gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding.
Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including
Calvin Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
/-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler
hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
owner of Candyland.

DJANGO
Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, so you heard of it?

DJANGO
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
and apparently the repellent gentleman down
there is the one who owns her.

ï¿½ï¿½` TIME CUT









6R
The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction
hall.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

DJANGO
Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
a couple niggers he'd fight.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you play a mandingo expert?

DJANGO
What?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

DJANGOÂ€¢
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Because when a man has one of the four
biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
his attention, we better be talking about
big sweaty black males. So my character is
that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
fight game. And your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

DJANGO
They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
Dr.SCHULTZ.
One-Eyed Charly?

DJANGO
That's what you call it when you buy a slave
expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
Dr'. SCHULTZ
Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?









70

DJANGO
You know, back on the plantation, my. job
wasn't historian.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
yes, if you can't.

DJANGO
You want me to play a black slaver? There
ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
Django gets that.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you do that?

DJANGO
That, I can do. What's next?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To get ourselves personally invited to
Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

CUT TO

EXT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO stand across the street from The Cleopatra Club.
Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among other.nice
houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville Mississippi.
They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the stoop
steps to the front door. They ring the doorbell.
A pretty young black girl, dressed in a FRENCH MAID outfit opens the
door.

FRENCH MAID

(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Bonjour.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(AMUSED)
Bonjour, mon petite femme noire.
We are here to see Calvin Candie.









7)
She's been taught to smile and say:

FRENCH MAID
Enter.
The two men walk into the entrance way of the house.
A beautiful mulatto HOSTESS greets the two men.

HOSTESS

(SPEAKING QUITE

REFINED)
Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you?
Dr.Schultz hands Cleo the guest card.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my
associate, Django Freeman.
Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We're here for a appointment with
Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy.

CLEO
Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please
make yourself comfortable. I'll inform
Monsieur Candie you've arrived.
(referring to the

FRENCH MAID)
Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
a tasty refreshment?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not at the moment.

CLEO
Then Coco will entertain you while I
inform Monsieur Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How charming.
Cleo leaves.
Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside.

INT - DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The DINERS
are made up exclusively of well dressed WHITE MEN, and pretty BLACK
GIRLS (PONYS) dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day.









72
Some appear to be on dates.
Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday, anniversary,
special treat).
- Some are.two men with two women.
Some are one man with two or three or more women.
The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
driven American dining.
The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
splits, and cookies.
While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
sarsaparilla.
Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Have you ever seen anything like this
before?
Django shakes his head, no.

COCO CHIRPS;

COLO. -

(VERY COUNTRY)
Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You
like catfish, we got good catfish. They use
alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we
got sand dabs.
LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.

MOGUY
Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity for this
appointment.
Mr.MOGUY
Nonsense, it's my job.

(CON'T)









73
Mr.MOGUY

(CON'T)

(LOOKING AT

DJANGO)
.So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
so much about.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

MOGUY
Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
along too?
Dr.SCHULTZ
We would be quite lucky indeed if the
charming Coco cared.to follow.
Coco blushes.

MOGUY
You better watch out doctor, you gonna
steal this little pony's heart.
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

SAY;
Dr.SCHULTZ
How long have you been associated with
Mr.Candie?

MOGUY
Calvin and I were about eleven when we
went to boarding school together. One
could almost say, I was raised to be
Calvin's lawyer.

DJANGO
One could almost say, you a nigger.
Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
Mr.Moguy.

MOGUY
What did you say?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
know before I meet him?

MOGUY
Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.









7EF
Dr.SCHULTZ
What civilized people aren't?

MOGUY
That's why all the French ambiance. And
he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRENCH)
What ever he prefers.
This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

MOGUY
Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
Moguy slides the doors open...
The party enters the billiard room.

INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

VASSEPI.
Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Why do you want to get in the mandingo
business?
That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
(referring to Moguy)
.to make the proper introductions?
Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;









7S

CALVIN CANDIE
Quit stalling and answer the question.
The room is quiet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
The awful truth?

(PAUSE)
I'm bored, and it seems like a good
bit of fun.
Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
goin on that's a good bit of fun_
Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?

MOGUY
Big Fred.

CALVIN CANDIE
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

(TO AMERIGO)
What's your nigger's name?

AMERIGO
Luigi... .?
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
named, ROSCOE tends it.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
a good bit of fun?

DJANGO
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

CALVIN CANDIE
How'd you two like to try the signature drink
of the club?









79
Dr.SCHULTZ
We'd love to.

CALVIN CANDIE
(yelling to the

BARTENDER)
Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
don't spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's your name, boy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Where'd ya dig him up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
real bright boy.

(BEAT)
I'm curious, what makes you such a
mandingo expert?

DJANGO
I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

BARTHOLOMEW
What you say, boy?









77
/ï¿½. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

CALVIN CANDIE
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.

CALVIN CANDIE
Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
Dr.SCHULTZ
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to
discuss business.

CALVIN CANDIE
No we weren't talking business yet. We
were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here, if I do
business with you...

(POINTING TO

SCHULTZ)
, .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

(POINTING TO

DJANGO)
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
but more or less, yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
looked over my African flesh, and were
none too impressed.

FLASH ON
we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..









BACK TO CLEO CLUB

DJANGO
Not for top dollar.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well then we got nothing more to talk
about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
from me, those are the beat ass niggers
I wanna sell.

DJANGO
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
sell. He wants the nigger you don't
wanna sell.

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
sell.
Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
Dr.SCHULTZ
You won't sell your best. You won't even
sell your second best. But your third
best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
forced to consider it... . who knows what
could happen?

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you consider ridiculous?
Dr.SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen,
."The Right Nigger"..:?
How much would you say, Django?

DJANGO
Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

CALVIN CANDIE
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
you got my attention.

CALVIN CANDIE
How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO COCO)
How's your Catfish, dew drop?

COCO
Real good Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
You spend a lot of time around niggers
aside from Freeman here?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not so much.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
treat this was for 'em. You feel special
Coco?

COCO
Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
You feel special Bartholomew?

BARTHOLOMEW
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

SHEBA
Yep.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
special?

DJANGO

(MEANING SHEBA)
Not as special as her.
The table breaks out in laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well we're leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
You oughta come with us.
Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
suppose I could be amenable to that.
How far must we trek?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
There you can get a look at my best
specimens. Have dinner with my sister
and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
my guest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

WE CUT

EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
"Candyland."
Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
(BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
with'supplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.









J

RODNEY
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

FLASH ON
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

RODNEY
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

DJANGO ON TONY
sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man;

DJANGO
Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
Rodney looks away.

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
You want a boot heel in it?

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
Flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give ya reason not to like me!
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
not without difficulty.
Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How do you like this side of the slave
trade?

DJANGO
Not so much.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Prefer the other side?

DJANGO
I didn't say that.








Dr.SCHULTZ
I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

DJANGO
Are you sure it's her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
He didn't call her by name, but she's a
young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
assume, in this instance, I think it's
pretty safe.

DJANGO
Did you offer to buy her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
so interested.

SUDDENLY ...
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

CALVIN CANDLE
Am I intruding?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Of course not.

CALVIN CANDIE

(APPRAISING THE

TWO MEN)
I swear you two are cozier then a couple
of cuttle fish.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You'd be surprised what a good
conversationalist Django is.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh by now, I don't think that would
surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
When do we reach your property?









1?3

CALVIN CANDLE
You been on it. I own the whole sixty
miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

CALVIN CANDIE
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

(YELLING BEHIND
him at Billy)
Billy Crash, git up here!
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
rides up.

BILLY CRASH
Yeah, Boss?

CALVIN CANDIE
Find out what that goddamn commotion
is up at the tracker shack!

BILLY CRASH
Right away, Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know, confidentially, just 'tween
us girls, worse things about this
business, ain't the slaves. It's all
the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with
us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
And don't think they don't know it either.
It's about the only thing these dumbass
motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
niggers ass, other than somebody might as
well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
patience, that German lady taught Hildi
how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
ï¿½, emotions betray nothing.









PTE

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell's goin on?

BILLY CRASH
They got 'em a runaway.

CALVIN CANDIE
Who?

CUT TO

EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

MARSHA.
A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
patch.









O V5
The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?

D'ARTAGNAN
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
myself think!
Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
Mr.STONESIPHER
Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
(to the other

TRACKERS)
Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
he's just makin' em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long was he loose?
Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
Mr.STONESIPHER
A.night. Day. Half the other night.

CALVIN CANDIE
How far he git off property?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
considering that limp he got.

CALVIN CANDIE
Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
Friday?.

MOGUY
(pointing behind him)
One of this new lot.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

(TO D'ARTAGNAN)
Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
a tail on a teddy bear.
D'Artagnan starts begging.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
business. Now I done paid five hundred
dollars for you. And when I pay five
hundred dollars, I expect to get five
fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
and play dead. You've fought three fights.

D'ARTAGNAN
I won every one.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
on the ground.

CALVIN CANDIE
But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
dollars, I want five fights. So what
about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
reimburse me?
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
bastard.
Calvin prods further.

CALVIN CANDIE
You even know what reimburse means?









E 17
The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY ...
.The German Speaks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'll reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
direction of the good German.

CALVIN CANDIE
You will?
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes.

CALVIN CANDIE
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
broom?
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

DJANGO
No he won't.
All eyes turn to Django.

DJANGO
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
right, Doc?
Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO CANDIE)
You heard 'em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
green jacket, slack jawed.
!` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.









CALVIN CANDIE
You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?
Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
Mr.STONESIPHER
That's right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well now since you won't pay a penny for
this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger however I see fit?

DJANGO
He's your nigger.

CALVIN CANDIE
Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Marsha...git 'em!
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
Shepherds back.
The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

THE MANDINGOS
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
Candie.staring contest with Django...
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
ï¿½-. to Django.









P9

CALVIN CANDIE
Your boss looks a little green around
the gills for a blood sport like
nigger fightin'?
As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

DJANGO
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.

CALVIN CANDIE
But you are use to it?

DJANGO
Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
a little more use to American's then
he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
ready, we rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
ain't impressed.
Calvin...BLINK...
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.

CALVIN CANDIE
Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
apart.

EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
Django.









90
All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.

EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
(very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

THEN ...
.DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
same village.
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
the Big House to greet her brother.








Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
steps...

STEPHEN
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
South. -
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
(almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

THEN...
Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello Stephen my boy!

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
this nigger up on that nag?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

STEPHEN
Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
on that nag?

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Snowball.








: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

DJANGO
If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
my horse, you ask me.

STEPHEN
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

CALVIN CANDIE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
funny. Django's a Freeman.
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

STEPHEN
This nigger, here?

CALVIN CANDIE
That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
the two of. you. Django, this is another
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this is Django. You two should
hate each other.
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
blacks at Candyland.

STEPHEN
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
feel the need to entertain?

CALVIN CANDIE
Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
are customers, and they are our guests
Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
.are to show them every hospitality.
Do you understand that?

STEPHEN
I don't know why I gotta -

CALVIN CANDIE
You don't hafta know why, do you
understand?

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

CALVIN CANDIE
Good. They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.









93

STEPHEN

(POINTING AT

DJANGO)
He's gonna stay in the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
In the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
You gotta problem with that?

STEPHEN
I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
and the pillow cases once this black ass
motherfuckers gone!

CALVIN CANDIE
That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
Your problem, right now, is making a
good impression. And I want you to start
solving that problem right now, and git
them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

STEPHEN
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
to her brother on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
Django,
(Django tips his hat)
and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.








Dr.SCHULTZ
And it is our great delight to encounter
this flaming rose.

LARA LEE
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
You're not from around here, are you?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually I'm from a far off land,
Dusseldorf, to be exact.

CALVIN CANDIE
These two are in the market for a fightin'
nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
show 'em my stock.

LARA LEE
We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

CALVIN CANDIE
Half the reason I invited them. I thought
you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
You know since I started fightin' niggers
about eleven years ago, it's been a new
lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
now is the man responsible for all my
success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
Schultz.

CALVIN CANDIE
Howdy Ace.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
Ace Woody.









915
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

CALVIN CANDIE
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
Cody.

(TO ACE)
Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
Django Freeman, they're big customers with
big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
brought 'em out here so you could give
'em a little display of our African flesh.
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

ACE WOODY
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
Django.
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
Greenville to here.

ACE WOODY
These the new chickens?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob.

ACE WOODY
How many you get?

(HE COUNTS)
One, two, three, four, five.

CALVIN CANDIE
Five real strong bucks.

ACE WOODY
How many you get rid of?

CALVIN CANDIE
We still got three left.
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
Leo Moguy chimes in;

MOGUY
I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
they'll be here tomorrow.
Ace turns to Brown.









ACE WOODY
Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
the pen till tomorrow.
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
the slave pen.
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

ACE WOODY
Y'all stand over there and make a line!
They do.
Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you think?

ACE WOODY
I think you lookin' for niggers to push
a plow, 'dem your boys.
Candie rolls his eyes.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's wrong with them?

ACE WOODY
Hold it...hold it, you done bought
r em, let me look at 'em.
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

ACE WOODY
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
buy that one?

CALVIN CANDIE
Which one?

ACE WOODY
What you mean, which one? The one I'm
pointing at, that one.









77

CALVIN CANDIE
Actually, that one was purchased by
our mister Moguy.

ACE WOODY

(TO MOGUY)
You bought him?

MOGUY
Yes I did.

ACE WOODY
Why?

MOGUY
I like his prospects.

ACE WOODY
His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
Remind me again what prospects means?

MOGUY
Hope for the future.
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
You got hope for his future?

MOGUY
I did.

ACE WOODY
Well I don't.
Ace walks over to the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
What's your name, boy?
The mandingo says;

SIDNEY JAMES
Sidney James, sir.

ACE WOODY
So long Sidney James.
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.








Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.

ACE WOODY
Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well to me the pick of the litter is
Big Fred over there.

ACE WOODY

(POINTING AT

FRED)
This one over here?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You Fred?
A very scared Fred answers.

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody,
I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now
Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in
a kurfuffle?

CALVIN CANDIE
I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
last night.

'ACE WOODY
How is of Amerigo?

CALVIN CANDIE
His nigger lost.









99

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really? You won?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Wup'ed his ass?

CALVIN CANDIE
Beat 'em to death.
Smiling impressively at Big Fred.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really?

CALVIN CANDIE
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
but still, he still beat his ass
to death.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You did?

BIG FRED)
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now why did you do that?

ACE WOODY
He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos









1 00

ACE WOODY

(TO MANDINGOS)
Those of you with exceptional ability
will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
you who don't possess exceptional ability,
will wish you did.
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.

ACE WOODY
Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
in the head.

(TO MANDINGOS)
Welcome to Candyland, boys!
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

CALVIN CANDLE
We only get about two out of every batch
of five fighters we buy. But those two
tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust my judgement?
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

ACE WOODY
Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
Boss Candie...eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?

STEPHEN
All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're incorrigible.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
rooms.









/O+

CALVIN CANDLE

(CON'T)
There you can lie down and rest up
for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
my finer specimens.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

CALVIN CANDIE
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.

DJANGO
That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
care of 'em now.

TIMMY
Yes, sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

DJANGO
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

DJANGO
Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?

CALVIN CANDIE
Nigger girl?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I believe you said she spoke German?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?








,oz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't see why not.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

STEPHEN
Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

CALVIN CANDIE
What?

STEPHEN
Hildi's in The Hot Box.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's she doin' there?

STEPHEN
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
she bein punished.

CALVIN CANDIE
What she do?

STEPHEN
She ran away again.

CALVIN CANDIE
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
when I was gone?

STEPHEN
Two.

CALVIN CANDIE
When did she go?

STEPHEN
Last night. They brought her back this
morning.









CALVIN CANDLE
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
motherfuckers right now.

STEPHEN
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Runnin' through them damn bushes.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long she been in the box?

STEPHEN
What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.

CALVIN CANDLE
Take her out.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
Take her out? Why!

CALVIN CANDLE
Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
to him.

STEPHEN
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

CALVIN CANDLE
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
her out.
(to Cora and

LARA LEE)
Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
for getting her cleaned up and presentable
for Dr.Schultz?
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.








Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.

WHEN ...
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.

STEPHEN

(TO DJANGO)
You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
little box?
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.









105

STEPHEN
This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
nice too.
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
rattles on in the background.

STEPHEN
Feel free to touch anything you want,
cause we burnin' all this shit once you
gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
door when the demonstration ready.
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Not so fast.

STEPHEN
I got more important things to do then
jaw with you.

DJANGO
Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

DJANGO
This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
do fer me?

STEPHEN
Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DING-A-LING

STEPHEN

(UNAMUSED)
What 'cha want?

DJANGO
I want you to pour some water in that
bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.









)O'
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

DJANGO
Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
that?
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
knocking him to the floor;

DJANGO
That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
floor below his knees.

DJANGO
I've known me House Niggers like you my
whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
all the white folks think it's so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
good side. Well this time Snowball, you
gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
you wanna sling my way, before they give
us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
give this whole motherfuckin plantation
a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
off your ass. I will make you drop your
drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
every nigga on this plantation. And after
I do that, let's see you play the rooster
round here.









X07

STEPHEN
Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

DJANGO
Oh that's right, he gives you first name
privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
me again nigger, see what happen'.
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

DJANGO
That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

DJANGO
When I ring this bell, you better come
a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
I'm on this property, you my nigger
Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
Schultz stands there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Was that wise?
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

DJANGO
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.

INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
Dr.Schultz opens the door.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Hello ladies.









DOG

LARA LEE
Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
speaks German.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO BROOMHILDA)
I've been informed you do as well.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Astonishing.

(IN GERMAN)
Please come inside Fraulein.
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
"Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
disoriented girl.
He gives her a pleasant smile.
Dr.SCHULTZ
They call you Hildi, but your real name
is Broomhilda, isn't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes. How do you know that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Stands to reason who ever taught you
German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water,
Broomhilda?
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
on the frightened girl.









107

WE CUT TO DJANGO
on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
to present himself.
BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
I'm only speaking German to you now,
Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
listening to us. Myself and a mutual
friend of ours, have gone through a lot
of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
find you fraulein - to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird, rescue me?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Please drink.
She absentmindedly obeys.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(.GERMAN).
Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
intention to take you away from here
forever.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I don't got any friends.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
surprise you.









!!0

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Where is he?
He points at the adjoining door.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Standing right behind that door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Promise me you won't scream?
She nods her head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Say, I promise.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I promise.
Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
The door knob turns.
The door slowly opens revealing...
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
He smiles at her, and says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
.first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
the water spills on the floor ...
.followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.









1/1
The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You silver tongued devil you.

MONTAGE
WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
vaguely optimistic ...
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
continues over this scene.
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
A study in powerless fury.

DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

STEPHEN
What you. whistlin', girl?
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

STEPHEN
What was you whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
Oh nuttin'.

STEPHEN
You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
no.name.









)/Z

STEPHEN
It's kinder pretty.
She doesn't say anything in return.

STEPHEN
That was a compliment.

BROOMHILDA
Thank you.
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
you are two days later, whistlin' while you
work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
.I'm jus' sayin'.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

BROOMHILDA
I'm done here, may I be excused?

STEPHEN
Yes you may.
She moves off to another part of the house.
He watches her shuffle off.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
Domestic Slaves despise Django.
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.









"5.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
specimens, no doubt about it. But the
best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
called Eskimo Joe?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
best, and you'll never sell him and I can
see why, he's a champion.

CALVIN CANDIE
All three are champions.
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

DJANGO
Samson's the champion. The other two
are pretty good.
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
contradict Calvin Candie.
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
potatoes.

LARA LEE
Hildi!
Broomhilda snaps back.
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
then issues his own appraisal;

CALVIN CANDIE
Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
long as you don't put 'em up against those
two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

DJANGO
Maybe.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.









//

F
Dr.SCHULTZ
You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
game, I do have a bit of a background in
the European traveling circus. Hence, I
have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
sip of his mint julep, then says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
is no one in the nigger fight game that
appreciates the value of showmanship
more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
one must not forget the most important
thing in the nigger fight game.

(BEAT)
A nigger that can win fights. That should
be your first, second, third, four, and
fifth concern. After you have that, and
you know you have that, then, you can
start to implement a grande design. But
since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
status - beating Moguy by one year for
that honor allow the old sage to advise,
first things first.
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

CALVIN CANDIE
I see you two gettin' on?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
Dr.SCHULTZ
.Famously.

(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
it's like not to hear you native tongue
for four years.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.









Â»5
Everybody at the table chuckles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I can't express the joy I felt conversing
in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
charming conversation companion.
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

LARA LEE
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but it
looks like this ponys got big eyes for
Django.
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

AND ...
.STEPHEN sees it.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
kitchen.
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
a drink in this house in twenty years.

STEPHEN
When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
a COLD drink.
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE
Did you overhear that joke I said about
me spending two weeks in Boston

STEPHEN

(MOCK INDIGNANT)
You don't have any idea the work I do
to see food gets on the table.









1/6

CALVIN CANDIE
What does that hafta do with the price of
Tea in China?

STEPHEN
You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
nothin' better to do then listen in here
to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE

(MOCK INDIGNATION)
What? They laughed!

STEPHEN
Of course they laughed, their parents
raised them right. When they're a guest
in somebody's house, and the master of
of the house thinks he's- funny, you
suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
Chuckle... .chuckle...
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

CALVIN CANDIE
No it was really funny,

(TO TABLE)
wasn't it?

STEPHEN
Now what do you expect these people to
say? What you need to do is stop
embarrassing your guest.

(TO TABLE)
Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
polite, I understand, you mean well, but
it just encourages him.
Chuckle-chuckle...
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

STEPHEN
You know that nigger?
/ï¿½ She spins around.









11 7

BROOMHILDAÂ€¢
Who?

STEPHEN
Don't stall me bitch, you know who?

BROOMHILDA
At the table? I don't know him.

STEPHEN.
You don't know him?

BROOMHILDA
No.

STEPHEN
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
She shakes her head, no.
Stephen looks at her skeptical.

STEPHEN
Okay, if you say so.

BACK TO DINNER TABLE
Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.

DJANGO
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
about it. But if it was my money, I
wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
for him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What would your price be?

DJANGO
Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
and I don't know why I would be inclined
to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
Candie's lawyer chimes in.

MOGUY
But the real question is, not how much
he cost, but how much he can earn?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django?

DJANGO
In a years time, seven or eight fights -
outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...

(CON'T)









11Y

DJANGO

(CON'T)
Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
one thousand dollars.

CALVIN CANDIE
Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
you cut that cake, that spells profit.
Not to, mention a years worth of action at
the big table in a blood sport with a
winner nigger. However let me reclarify
how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
nigger, it was you who approached me to
buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
ain't too far off from right. And if I
wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
could sell 'em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
the power of persuasion.
Candie smiles at that remark.
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
The White people at the table get very happy.
Dr.Schultz continues;
Dr.SCHULTZ
However, that is a tremendous amount of
money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
up a legal contract before I would feel
comfortable exchanging that amount of
money for flesh. Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
choosing. So say I return in about five
days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
the finer points between themselves.









117

CALVIN CANDIE
Splendid.

(CALLING TO

THE KITCHEN)
Stephen, time for dessert!
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

BROOMHILDA
Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may, Hildi.
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.

CALVIN CANDIE
So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
table in the big house?

BROOMHILDA
I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a lot better then sizzling in that
hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
bramble bush, ain't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes 'em.
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
Stephen clocks this.
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

STEPHEN
You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
where he from.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
just speak German, or did ya git her
clothes off?









!20
Dr.SCHULTZ
We just spoke.

CALVIN CANDIE
So you haven't seen her back?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No I haven't.

CALVIN CANDIE
Then Stephen's right, you would probably
find this interesting. Hildi, take off
your dress, and show us your back.
Django hears this.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
Stephen clocks it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.

CALVIN CANDIE
But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
they don't got niggers there. And he's a
man of medicine. I'm sure it would
fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
pain. I mean Hildi got something like
fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
are tough, no doubt about it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
Stephen watches him.
Candie folds.

CALVIN CANDIE
Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
During the brandies.
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
kitchen.
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
the kitchen door.









121

INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

STEPHEN
I thought you said you didn't know him?
Broomhilda turns around.

BROOMHILDA
Huh?
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

STEPHEN
I said, you said, you didn't know him?

BROOMHILDA
I don't.

STEPHEN
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA
Mister Stephen, I don't.

STEPHEN
Why you lyin to me?
As tears begin to well in her eyes.

BROOMBILDA
I ain't.

STEPHEN
Why you cryin'?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scarin' me.

STEPHEN
Why am I scarin' you?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scary.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
.to speak German,with Hildi this
afternoon was positively soul enriching.
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.









1ZL
His eyes to to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
You, stay in the kitchen.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
just figured it out.

INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ
You indicated earlier you would be
willing to part with Hildi?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob I did.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case allow me to propose
another proposition?
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
- Monsieur Candie?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
(to Dr.Schultz)
Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
ain't worth a damn these days.

(TO CANDIE)
Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
the kitchen.

CALVIN CANDIE
What, you mean get outta my chair?

STEPHEN
If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

CALVIN CANDIE
What about dessert?

STEPHEN
I would rather tell you in private.

CALVIN CANDIE
We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
melodrama could be brewing back there?









123
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

STEPHEN
Meet me in the library.
Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
library" is their secret signal.

CALVIN CANDIE
Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
Stephen exits.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
they are in the kitchen, from time to
time, adult supervision is required.
If you'll excuse me a moment.
Candie exits.

TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
turkey.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's the matter?

STEPHEN
Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
mandingos. They want that girl. -

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell you talkin' about?

STEPHEN
They playin your ass for a fool, that's
what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
that girl.









CALVIN CANDIE
What girl, Hildi?

STEPHEN
Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

CALVIN CANDIE
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

STEPHEN
Did he give you any money?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well not yet, but -

STEPHEN
- Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
how. But he was just about to buy, who he
came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

CALVIN CANDIE
Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
go through all that trouble, to. buy a
nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
five hundred dollars?

STEPHEN
Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
Now why that German gives a fuck about
who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
with, I'm sure I don't know.

CALVIN CANDIE
If she's who they want, why the whole
snake oil pitch about mandingos?

STEPHEN
Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
to four hundred dollar. But twelve
thousand got you real friendly.
Calvin thinks ...
.as per usual, Stephen's right.

CALVIN CANDIE
Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
sonsabitches!

(LOUDER)
Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
.gonna have us a Candyland tar and
feathering!









FL5

STEPHEN
Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
seein' something like that ... . but why
don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

CALVIN CANDLE
I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
huckster insinuate themselves at my
dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
plantation for a fool!

STEPHEN
Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
discuss this.
A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

STEPHEN
Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
was something up with these two. We just
didn't know what. But now we do. They
don't want you to know how bad they want
that girl. But these ole boys have rode
a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
bull to get this girl. They must want her
mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
changed is the advantage.

(BEAT)
Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
and busts these motherfucker's chops.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
kitchen door.
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

SEEING HIM;

LARA LEE
There you are! I was beginning to think
you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
stares down the table at them.

CALVIN CANDLE
That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
Lara Lee?

(CON'T)









1Z J

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and
give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
your shoulder?
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
pointing at them.
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
he's holding a big ugly hammer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now you lift those palms off that turtle
shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
There's been a lotta lies said around this
table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

(BEAT)
Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
Mr.Moguy does.
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
were just getting ready to make me a
proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Right.

CALVIN CANDIE

(YELLING TO

STEPHEN)
Stephen! Bring out Hildi!








Ix?
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
against the side of her head.
Django and Schultz react.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now it should be quite clear by now I know
you're not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
horseshit.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
silently watch Candie's next move.
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
myself said, "What is your definition of
ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
thousand dollars."
Now considering you two have ridden a whole
lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I take it you prefer the take it or leave
it style of negotiating.
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
everybody jump.









IN

CALVIN CANDIE
And if you think my price for this nigger
is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I lift my hands from the table top in
order to remove my billfold?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may.
Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
jacket, and says;,
Dr.SCHULTZ
Easy come, easy go.
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
the seated Schultz, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Pleasure doin' business with you.

TIME CUT

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
.Moguy signs as a witness.
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
freedom papers.
Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
dollars- for twelve thousand.








Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
rhubarb pie with him.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Rhubarb pie?
Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
Dr.SCHULTZ
No.

CALVIN CANDIE
Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
of ya?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually, I was thinking of that poor
devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
all this.
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
examines he papers.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dumas...?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
I figured you must be an admirer. You named
your slave after that novel's lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
wonder what he would of made of it?

CALVIN CANDIE
You doubt he'd approve?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
at best.

CALVIN CANDIE
Soft hearted Frenchy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas is black.









1 30
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
We got it, let's go.

(TO CANDIE)
Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is, till I see you again,
and since I never wish to see you again,
to you sir, I say, goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the German's back;

CALVIN CANDIE
One more moment, Doc!
Dr.SCHULTZ
What?

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a custom here in the South, once a
business deal is concluded, for the two
parties to shake hands. It implies good
faith.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not from the South.
He turns to leave.

CALVIN CANDIE
You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
I must insist.
This turns Schultz around.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Insist what...? That I shake your hand
before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know what I think you are?
Dr.SCHULTZ
What you think I am? No I don't.









1310,

CALVIN CANDLE
I think you are a bad loser.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

CALVIN CANDLE
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
a deal ain't done till the two parties have
shook hands. Even after all this paper
signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
away twelve thousand dollars...?
I don't think so.
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let's go.

CALVIN CANDIE
Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
before this German shakes my hand.
Cut 'er down.
Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
.and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

CANDLE;
Dr.SCHULTZ.
You really want me to shake your hand?
Django gets it.

CALVIN CANDIE
I insist.

DR
-Schultz smiles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, if you insist.
Django goes to stop him...









1 714
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

POP!
He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
falls to the floor.
Everybody is stunned.
Schultz looks to Django.
Django looks back.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

FADE TO BLACK








We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to ...

TIMMY

(SHHH'S HIM)
Act like you still sleepin'.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

TIMMY
Who?

DJANGO
Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
couple of days ago. They had her in The
Hot Box.

TIMMY
I don't know 'bout no girl.

DJANGO
How 'bout that German white man I came
here with?

TIMMY
Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
bucket at the fleeing boy.

ACE WOODY
Git on outta here, boy!









133
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

ACE WOODY
So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
Django thinks, "How does he know?"

ACE WOODY
I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures
in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
line of work?
Django retorts, upside down.

DJANGO
Well, it turns out I was a natural.
Ace woody laughs.

ACE WOODY
Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
length from the hanging man.

ACE WOODY
See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
everyone 'round here blames you.
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

ACE WOODY
Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
able to attend.
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
. IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
Django's face.
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
As he does this, he says;









ACE WOODY
Now I understand you didn't really have
nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks 'round here need someone
to blame. And I guess they figure if you
hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what, they got a point.
He THROWS the knife again...
.this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
As he does he says;

ACE WOODY
Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
the error of his ways, believe me when I.
tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
there try an' git creative with the way they
bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
methods are, tried and true.
He THROWS the knife again...
Django JERKS his head back ...
.and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
mercy.

ACE WOODY
You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight, neither.

(BEAT)
Then you came along. Knocked me right off
that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
mandingos as her brother?
Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
could say I gotta axe to grind.









IJS
He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

ACE WOODY
How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
Django dances some more ...

ACE WOODY
Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

(BREATH)
On the count of three.

DJANGO SCREAMS:

DJANGO

NO!!!!

ACE WOODY

ONE ...

DJANGO

NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

ACE WOODY
Got to do it, boy. TWO...

DJANGO

NO!!!! !
Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

STEPHEN
Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
talk about the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
Dickey people.
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

ACE WOODY
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
of what almost happened.

ACE WOODY

(TO DJANGO)
How disappointing.









171

ACE WOODY

(TO STEPHEN)
Where she at?

STEPHEN
She in the big house. The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
the fire.
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

ACE WOODY
You gonna look after our friend?
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

STEPHEN
Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
upside down nigger we both know, gonna
have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

GLOWS ORANGE.

STEPHEN
Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
alone.
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
hanging Django.

STEPHEN
I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville -
look up the Ole Man there.

(BREATH)
That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
Big House.









137

STEPHEN

(BEAT)
And that's where you met me. And that's when
you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
tip of that red hot poker.

STEPHEN
Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
didn't know what's what. He still thought his
ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
you are, you always know the end is near
'fore the white folks.
With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
breathing it in his nostrils.

STEPHEN
Damn Nigger, you smell good.
He walks behind Django with the poker.

STEPHEN
You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
bed in the quest room in the Big House -
After you slapped my ass to the floor
You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
Remember that, Bright Boy?
He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
buttocks.
Django SCREAMS!
Stephen LAUGHS.
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
the floor by the hanging man.

STEPHEN
You leavin', that's what you can take
with you.
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.









I31

STEPHEN
Now you were quite the topic of conversation
for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
never had a bright idea in their life, was
comin' up with different ways to kill your
ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
"Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
worse then that."
He stops massaging Django's balls.

STEPHEN
So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
Like them three y'all came back with. For them
big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
I give two or three.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

STEPHEN
She's all right for now. Miss Lara
soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or
smell too good, but ain't nobody
gonna bother her.
Stephen limps away.

CUT TO









137

EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

ROY
It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
git out.
The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

FLOYD
You blacks line up.
They do.

FLOYD
What's your names?

CHESTER
Chester.

CHICKEN CHARLY
Chicken Charly.

RODNEY
Rodney.

FLOYD
I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

(POINTING AT

CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
What's that?

CHESTER
It's my stuff.

FLOYD
Throw it in the dirt.









1 40
All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

FLOYD
(to Chicken Charly)
You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
(to all three)
You are now the property of The LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
Woody call out;

ACE WOODY (OS)
Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
for ya.
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

ROY
We can't use that skinny bastard.

ACE WOODY
We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
punishment niggers from time to time.

ROY
No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

ACE WOODY
Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

ROY
Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

ACE WOODY
- No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
how and why you fucked up our nice little
business relationship, take this nigger and
hush up about it!

ROY
Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.









"H
Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
Django stops Ace Woody.

DJANGO
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
with them. They'll kill me. What about all
that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
but I didn't think that was the idea.
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

ACE WOODY
He can't go in there with them.

FLOYD
Why not?

ACE WOODY
They'll kill him.

FLOYD
I don't give a damn.

ACE WOODY
Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

ROY
Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
black and make sure he keeps up.

JANO
Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
around his saddle horn.
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.
Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney,
Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon, Jano
riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him.









J42

DJANGO

(TO JANO)
Hey boy!
Jano ignores him.

DJANGO
I said, hey white boy!

JANO
Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

DJANGO
What's he pay you?

JANO
Who?

DJANGO
LeQuint Dickey?

JANO
You gotta few more things to worry about
black boy, then what I get paid.

DJANGO
I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
Mining Company, ain't I?

JANO
Yeah.

DJANGO
And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, dont'cha?

JANO
Yeah?

DJANGO
Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
for instance, how much you gettin' paid
for today?

JANO
Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
paid for our passage from Australia to here.
We get a little money to send back home, and
pay him back for the boat trip.









I"

DJANGO
How long you been here?

JANO
'bout two years.

DJANGO
And you ain't paid him back yet?

JANO

(DEFENSIVELY)
No, not yet!

DJANGO

(LAUGHS)
You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
your ass for the price of a boat ride.
At least they didn't charge us for our boat
ride ... . ha ha ha ha...

JANO

(YELLING)
You shut up!
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
Django, when the black man says to him;

DJANGO
How'd you like to make eleven thousand
dollars?

JANO
What?
Django steps closer to him.

DJANGO
How would you like to make eleven thousand
dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
actually?
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;

ROY
Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
and keep up!

DJANGO
Keep riding, just ride slower.
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.









R44

DJANGO
Back at that plantation Candyland, there
was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
right past it.

JANO
You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

DJANGO
That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
earn it.

JANO
If you got something to say, say it.

DJANGO
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

JANO
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
dollars for each of his three accomplices,
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
cause they just got away with murder.

(BEAT)
But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
mates could get that money.

JANO
Who pays the money?

DJANGO
The Court.

JANO
The Court?

DJANGO
The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
the way, the court don't give a damn about
how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
back, from up on a hill, in the back of
the head, in their sleep - don't matter.

(CON'T)









DJANGO

(CON'T)
Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
long as you do it.

JANO
They.pay us to kill 'em?

DJANGO
No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
corpse. Get it?

JANO
I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

DJANGO
Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
He hands it to Jano.

JANO
What's this?

DJANGO
I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
Jano looks at the handbill.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter, can't you read?

JANO
I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

DJANGO
What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

JANO
Roy?

DJANGO
Can Roy read?

JANO
Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin
read. I just don't got my glasses.

EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
the side of the road.

IN THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
what they're watching.
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
piece of paper.

INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

DJANGO
I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
Candyland on a horse with my white German
partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
blame me, so here I am.

(TO ROY)
You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
But those four men, are still back there.
They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
and gittin it.
Django is damn convincing.

ROY
What's your deal? You tell us who they are
and we let ya go?

DJANGO
I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
one little push.









1Q7

DJANGO
Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
me in the same cage with them without them
killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
.am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

CUT TO

ROY AND FLOYD
go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
Roy continues to study the handbill.

ROY

(READING ALOUD)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each
of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

FLOYD
Just because the handbill's real doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

ROY
Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
or alive handbill in his pocket?
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

ROY
That black's damn convincing.
They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

ROY
(pointing, behind
him, at Django)
That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
the barrel at the cage.

ROY
I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
he ride in with a white man yesterday?









CHESTER
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
Auction and he rode on a horse with a
white man.

ROY
This white man, was the black his slave?

RODNEY
He weren't no slave.

FLOYD
You sure about that?

RODNEY
Damn sure.
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
seriously.

ROY
What happened at Candyland?

CHICKEN CHARLY
Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

ROY
Who shot 'em?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The German.

ROY
And why did he do that?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The nigger and the German were actin as if they
were slavers, but they weren't.

ROY
What were they?

RODNEY
Bounty hunters.
Floyd is starting to get convinced.

FLOYD
Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
(to the Slaves)
Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?









!Y,

ROY
(barking at Floyd)
They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
you idiot!

CUT TO
Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.

ROY
Okay black, you gotta deal.
Jano reacts.

DJANGO
I got one more condition.

ROY
What?

DJANGO
When we get there, when the time comes,
you let me help you kill 'em.
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

ROY

(LAUGHING)
You got a deal, black.
Django interrupts -

DJANGO
You gotta deal, mate.
Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

ROY
You're all right for a black fella!

THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

ROY
We'll give you that pack horse.

DJANGO
What's them saddle bags filled with?

FLOYD
Dynamite.








!so

DJANGO
I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
dynamite on his back!

ROY

(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
cage.
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
at all.
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
Cage Wagon.
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

DJANGO
Where's my pistol?

ROY
Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
'em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

FLOYD
Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
fixed last month, it's perfect.
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

DJANGO
That's good to know.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
in the chest...
Roy turns around...
Django takes the gun out of the holster...
. BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
dead.
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!








Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
The CAGE WAGON
Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
the air, obscuring all visibility...

THEN ...
A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
REVEALING in bright color focus...
.DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
Jano.
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
wrapped around his waist.
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
and climbs aboard him bareback.
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
next to him.
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

.THEN...
Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
cage door.
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

DJANGO
Throw up that dynamite.
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
his Horse.
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
"Who was that nigger?"

l.rz
A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from
the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of
Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
crying at her side.

CORA
The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
Candie think it real nice.

LARA LEE
Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
-Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel
next to the bunkhouse.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
(yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

EXT - WOODS-OUTSIDE THE SHACK - SUNSET
INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping. Django's bare feet jump on
to the ground.

INT - DOG KENNEL - SUNSET
The FOUR DOGS lay out... . when, Marsha hears something, and raises her
head...

SHIRTLESS DJANGO
moves quietly through the woods.

MARSHA
rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
PALS continue to lay out.

DJANGO BY A TREE
he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

MARSHA

BARK!
The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
Django disappears.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
They hear the barking inside.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Jake!
Jake building his birdhouse.

JAKE
Yeah?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Check on Marsha.
Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

EXT - TRACKER SHACK
As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

JAKE
opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.








After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
attack.
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
to take Stonesipher's ass out.
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
each other for their life.
Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
That weakens Stonesipher.
He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
That puts the mountain man down on his back.
He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
The Trackers are all dead.
Only the dogs mad barking remains.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway. The Preacher reads some
words over him.









EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
over to the WATER PUMP.
Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

DJANGO
What ya doin around here, boy?
Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.

TIMMY
I was just walkin' by.

DJANGO
Wanna help me out?

TIMMY
Sure.

DJANGO
My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash.
You know where his shack is?

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO
You show me?

TIMMY
Will I get in trouble?

DJANGO
Not by the time I get through killin'
everybody.
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

TIMMY
I'll show ya.

THEN ...
Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

DJANGO
You know what toadstools look like?









15-C

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO
Go pick me a mess of 'em.
INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in
the tracker shack.
Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
mixes it up with the spoon.

EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
the stew.
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

DJANGO
You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

DJANGO
First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

EXT - FUNERAL NIGHT
The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.

TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

DJANGO
Saddle up Fritz and Tony.








Timmy just stares.

DJANGO
Now, boy!
Timmy hops to work.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
holster around his ankle.
As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

TIMMY
Do you feel bad for your friend?
Django rises from the body of his friend.

DJANGO
Yeah, "I do.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

TIMMY
I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
friend once. He drowned in the lake.
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
understand.
He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
And finally his hat.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands,
and beginning to leave.

INT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
Billy Crash is in bed fucking Broomhilda. She doesn't wail, she doesn't
make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water.

BROOMHILDA
I can't help it! I'm really sad!
He hops off her and yells at her.

BILLY CRASH
Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad
for niggers! Git use to it!

(CALMING DOWN)
Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
from way back. But you know I've always been
sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
You calm down.
He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
Django, she cries for herself...

.THEN...
She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
front door.

CU BROOMHILDA
Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

BROOMHILDA

(SOFTLY)
Yes?
The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...

THERE HE IS,
she runs into his arms.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of
dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin.
The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The
funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the
overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher.
The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying
goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to
them.
A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the
hill back to the big house.

EXT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
Django with Broomhilda. Billy Crash lies dead in the B.G., Stonesipher's
Buck Knife buried deep in his chest. He hands Broomhilda her papers.

DJANGO
Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
and get out of the south.

BROOMHILDA
What's gonna happen to you?

DJANGO
Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,
I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little
Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is
named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me
around the side of the big house.

BROOMHILDA
But what about you -

DJANGO
- Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with
Timmy and the horses, by the big house.
He sends her on her way.
Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
down hill heading back for the big house.

EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk

LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.
CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand.
STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his
normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress

This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral
drinks.
They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
door.
Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in
their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking
their way.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
moves closer towards the front of The Big House...

WHEN ...
The front of The Big House

EXPLODES!
knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
BROOMHILDA and TIMMY
can't believe their eyes.

WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
hang in the air.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
CUE cool MUSIC.
STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
around his waist.
Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
.it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

OUTFIT.
STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
standing there.
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
the gun on his hip.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
Wonder, Fear, and Hate.

WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
as she watches this.
As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
The black man in the cool green jacket says;

DJANGO
I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

ACE WOODY
I guess I shoulda'.

DJANGO
Yes you should of.
He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

DJANGO
Everybody stand up!
It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

THEN...
He tosses the rifle away.
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

SHOWDOWN STANCE.
EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
at the ten people, and says;

DJANGO
All black folks, take ten steps away from
the white folks.
DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

DJANGO
Not you Stephen. You're right where you
belong.









163
The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
his pocket.

DJANGO

(TO STEPHEN)
Let's see if you can handle this as well
as you can my nuts?
He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

DJANGO

(TO EVERYBODY)
Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

BROWN

(TO DJANGO)
Can I at least cock it for her?

DJANGO
Yep.
BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
and points it towards the ground.

BROWN
(to Lara Lee)
Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
fast as you can.
LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
happen.

DJANGO
(to the six)
Make your play hillbillies.
The MUSIC SWELLS.









16'F
EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

DJANGO ACE WOODY

STEPHEN MOGUY

BROWN CODY

LARA LEE
The PEOPLE watching on the side:

BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

TILL...
ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
to raise his Derringer.
But it's no contest.
As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
Stephen) standing in front of him.
They all fall to grass in different ways..
It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

FLASH ON
DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
to Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(SMILING)
You know what they're going to call you,
my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

BACK TO SHOWDOWN
DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
Candyland front lawn.
The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.









/65
All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
DJANGO sees this.
The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
It EXPLODES.
Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
blowing the limbs off of many of them.
The LAWN is SILENT.
DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

BROOMHILDA
Hey Big Trouble Maker.

DJANGO
Down, boy.
Timmy hops off of Tony.
Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

DJANGO
I tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen
to me.

BROOMHILDA
Yes you did.

DJANGO
Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.

BROOMHILDA
I'll keep that in mind.









Â–º66
Django looks down to Timmy.

DJANGO
Thanks for the help, boy.
He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
down to Timmy.

DJANGO
That's for you. Good luck Tim.
(he points to
the Northern Sky)
The North star, is that one.
He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

DJANGO
You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

BROOMHILDA
You won't wait for me.

DJANGO
Better not.

BROOMHILDA
You won't.

DJANGO

(SMILING)
Better not.

BROOMHILDA

(SMILING)
You won't.
They kiss.
Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
Dragons.




OVER BLACK
We hear labored breathing.

BLACK FRAME
QUOTE APPEARS:

"Revenge is a dish
best served cold"

- Old Klingon Proverb -
QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;



MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Do you find me sadistic?

CUT TO:

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes
were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the
planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he

corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
I bet I could fry an egg on your
head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
now, you're aware enough to know
there isn't a trace of sadism in
my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
these other jokers - bot not your.

OVERHEAD SHOT
We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;



THE BRIDE
Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

CUT TO:
BLACK SCREEN: Presentation Credit



"The 4th Film by
QUENTIN TARANTINO"

CUT TO:

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two
bullet holes in her.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's his girlfriend Janeen.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still
clutched in her dead fist.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's my best friend from work
Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's the minister. I think his
name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's his wife.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Organ player, don't know her name.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The

name on his driver's license was
Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
some reason he preferred Arthur.
Maybe if he went by Carles people
would have called him Charlie. If
that was his reason for going by
Arthur I can understand it.
Nothing wrong with the name
Charlie, except he didn't look like
a Charlie, he looked like an
Arthur.
Obviously you'll have to take my
word on this. Speaking of names, I
was about two seconds away from
becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.



INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
trying, I can tell you that.
Actually Bill's last bullet put me
in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
for five years.
When I woke up, ...I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to
as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
roarded and I rampaged and I got
bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
killed 33 people to get to this
piont right now.
I have only one more.
The last one.

The one I'M driving to right now.
The only one left.
And when I arrive at my
destination.....
.... I'm gonna Kill Bill.


TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

WE FADE TO BLACK

CUT TO:

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR
WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:


"The city of
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"


We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.



EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.



INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.



FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.



LITTLE GIRL
Mommy, what happened to you and the
T.V. Room?

THE HOUSEWIFE
Oh, that good for nothin dog of
yours, got his little ass in the
living room and acted a damn fool,
that's what happened.



LITTLE GIRL
Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.



THE    HOUSEWIFE
Now baby, you    can't come in here,
there's broken    glass all over the
floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.



THE HOUSEWIFE
This is a old friend of mommy's I
ain't seen in a long time.



THE BRIDE
Hello sweety, I'm *(BLEEP)*, what's
your name?

* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know. *

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Her name is Nikki.



THE BRIDE
Nikki. What a pretty name for such
a pretty little girl. How old are
you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Nikki, *(BLEEP)* aked you a
question.



NIKKI
(to The Bride)
I'm four.



THE BRIDE
Four years    old, aye. You know I
once had a    little girl. She'd be
five right    now. Maybe you two could
of played    with each other.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Now baby, me an *(BLEEP)* have some
grown-up talk to talk about, so you
go in your room now and leave us
alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.



THE HOUSEWIFE
(snapping her fingers)
Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Want some coffee?



THE BRIDE
Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Cream and sugar?



THE BRIDE
Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
This Pasadena homemaker's name is
Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
Lawrence Bell. But back when we
were acquainted, five years ago,
her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.



THE BRIDE
Were you expecting me?



VERNITA
Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
me right after you woke up, and
then again a little later after
your episode in Japan.
(pause)
So I suppose it's a little late for
a apology, huh?



THE BRIDE
You suppose correctly.



VERNITA
Even if I was sincere?



THE BRIDE
Oh. I'm quite positive you're
sorry, now.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

VERNITA
Look bitch, I need to know if
you're gonna start anymore shit
around my baby girl!



THE BRIDE
You can relax for now. I'm not
going to murder you in front of
your daughter.



VERNITA
That's being more rational than
Bill led me to believe you were
capable of.



THE BRIDE
Well that's a demonstration of
Bill's complete ignorance when it
comes to the subject of me, and
what I'm thinking, and what I might
do. It's mercy, compassion, and
forgiveness I lack, not
rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.



THE BRIDE
I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
for long. I'll allow you to choose
a time and place for us to meet
again, preferably as far away from
Nikki as possible.
I could have just HIT you, I
didn't, I demand respect for that.
Since this is not a HIT, consider
it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
of honor. One on one - no help - no
bushwhackin - no treacherous
weapons - on weapon of choice - our
skill and our bodies.

Vernita says her name;



VERNITA
*(BLEEP)*

THE BRIDE
- I'm not through telling you.
Failure to keep our date, or
duplicity of any kind, will result
in me putting a xoxo hollow point
bullet into the back of your skull
from a window of a building across
the street from Nikki's elementary
school. Now, feel free to respond.



VERNITA
Look...I know I fucked you over. I
fucked you over bad. I wish to God
I hadn't, but I did.

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.



VERNITA
If I could go back in a machine I
would, but I can't. All I can tell
you is I'm a different person now.



THE BRIDE
I don't care.



VERNITA
Be that as it may, I know I do not
deserve mercy or forgiveness.
However, I beseech you for both on
behalf of my daughter.



THE BRIDE
-- Bitch, you can stop right there.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
well).



THE BRIDE
(leans in close)
Just because I have no wish to
murder you before the eyes of your
daughter, does not mean parading
her around in front of me is going
to inspire sympathy. You and I have
unfinished business.

And not    a goddamn fuckin thing
you've    done in the subsequent five
years -    including getting knocked
up - is    going to change that.



VERNITA
You have every right to wanna get
even --



THE BRIDE
-- But that's where you're wrong,
Vernita. I don't want to get even.
To get even, even Steven. I would
have to kill you, go into Nikki's
room, kill her, then wait for your
old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
kill him. That would make us even.
No, my unborn daughter will just
hafta be satisfied with your death
at her mother's hands.

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.



VERNITA
When do we do this?



THE BRIDE
It all depends... When do you want
to die? Tomorrow? The day after
tomorrow? That's about as long as
I'll wait.



VERNITA
How bout tonight, bitch?



THE BRIDE
Spendid. Where?



VERNITA
There's a baseball diamond where
our little league has its games,
about a mile from here. We meet
there around two-thirty in the
morning, dressed all in black, your
hair in a black stocking, and we
have us a knife fight, we won't be

bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.



THE BRIDE
Bill said you were one of the best
ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."



VERNITA
Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
qualify it, so you can just kiss my
motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
(snorts to herself)
Black Mamba, I shoulda been
motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.



THE BRIDE
Weapon of choice? And if you want
to stick with your butcher knife,
I'm cool with that.



VERNITA
Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.



VERNITA
Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
don't...



THE BRIDE
Do to your daughter, what you did
to mine...
(she takes her hand)
...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her    blade.



THE BRIDE
It was not my intention to do this
in front of you. For that I'm
sorry. But you can take my word for
it, your mother had it coming. When
you grow up, if you still feel raw
about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.



EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;


DEATH LIST FIVE

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;


VERNITA GREEN
COBRA

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

The door marked "ladies" is opened, and a beautiful 6-foot
blonde in a white nurse's uniform, with a matching white eye
patch over her left eye, steps out, carrying the nurse's tray
with the "Goodbye forever"-filled syringe on it.
She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's

INT. THE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Bride, alone in her bed, alone in her coma, alone in her
room.

Elle Driver opens the door to her room and steps inside.
The female assassin approaches the comatose woman.

EX CU ELLE DRIVER'S EYE AND WHITE EYE PATCH
looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and
opposite number.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES
wide open - blank stare.

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;



ELLE
I might never of liked you. Point
in fact I despise you. But that
doesn't suggest I don't respect
you. You were a master of a
profession that's most difficult to
master.
Dying in our sleep is a luxury our
kind is rarely afforded. My gift to
you.

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the
other end....she answers it.



ELLE
Hello, Bill.
(pause)
Affirmative.
(pause)
Comatose.
(pause)
I'm standing over her right now.
(pause)
What!

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of
The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell
phone.



ELLE
Don't fuckin ssshhh me! If you
think I came all the way down to
Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm
no less - just to tuck sleeping
beauty in bed - you got another
fuckin thing comin -
(pause, then real loud)
You don't owe her Shit!!
(then again, but quieter)
You don't owe her shit.
(pause)
Man, fuck that bitch!
(pause)
Oh you're not are you? Well Bill,
you never leave a job half done.
A great teacher taught me that
once, he looked a whole lot like

you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;



ELLE
I guess.
(pause)
No, I don't need to guess, I know.
(pause)
Affirmative.
(pause)
I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.



ELLE
Thought that was pretty funny
didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.



ELLE
Ya know now I get a better look at
you, you're not so damn pretty.
Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
for you but...ya know, now I get a
closer look at you you're kinda
weird looking. You got this big
nose that doesn't fit with the rest
of your face, your eyes are two
different sizes. And look at your
skin...My complexion is way better
than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.



ELLE
Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.



ELLE
If you ever take your ass out of
this Goddamn bed for as long as you
fuckin live, I will beat you into
the ground, bitch!



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the
hallway. She passes by a DOCTOR, STRUGGLING WITH A PATIENT
BLEEDING PROFUSELY on a gurney.



DOCTOR
(yelling)
Nurse come here quick, we're losing
this man!

Elle doesn't even look back.



ELLE
Tough titty, I quit.

She walks out of the SHOT.

FADE TO BLACK.

CUT TO:



INT. THE COMATOSE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA is in a corner of the ceiling, looking down on the
comatose Bride, who lies motionless in her bed.

WE HEAR the sound of a BUZZING MOSQUITO, doing loop de loops
and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood.

The BUZZING stops....

MACRO CU
of mosquito on The Bride's forearm, its stinger dug in her
flesh, visibly drawing blood from its host.

CU MOSQUITO'S FACE
drinking her blood.

MACROSHOT OF MOSQUITO ON FOREARM
drinking blood...when The Bride's hand comes into FRAME and
SQUASHES the bug flat. Her fingers FLICK the dead bug away.

CU The Bride
her wide-open eyes, that have stared in a constant gaze for
the last five years,
finally...slowly...softly...shut.

BEAT

They SUDDENLY POP OPEN.

The BRIDE SITS BOLD UPRIGHT IN BED.
She has no idea where the fuck she is. WE DO A SHAW BROTHERS
STYLE QUICK ZOOM INTO A CU OF HER FACE.

QUICK CUT TO A FLASHBACK SPAGHETTI-WESTERN STYLE
back at the wedding chapel, gun pointed down at our face.

THE BARREL EXPLODES LEAT AT US - BANG!

QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,
BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;



THE BRIDE
My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the
lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;



THE BRIDE

(to herself)
Five years.

She counts again.



THE BRIDE
(a statement)
Five years.

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby
is long gone.

WHEN SUDDENLY...

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING
TOWARDS HER ROOM....

WE SEE THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF A COMIC BOOK THOUGHT
BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL'S BLACK BOOTS
walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT

We see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks
softly slapping against the smooth surface of the
institution's floor. They make a sound nothing like Bill's
shoes.

SCREEN GOES TO SPLIT SCREEN

LEFT SIDE                       RIGHT SIDE
The BRIDE listening to them            Orderly's Reeboks walking
getting closer. WE HEAR the            down the hospital
STEP...STEP...STEP...in time           corridor.
with Orderly's sneakers.

CAMERA MOVES UP TO
Orderly's face, leading
two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;


BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY
(in time)                              (in time)
She's right in here.                She's right in here.


SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.



THE ORDERLY
Now is that the cutest little
blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
that the cutest little blonde
pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)
fronts.



WARREN
I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."



THE ORDERLY
Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
know damn well this is the best
pussy you ever saw you had touchin
rights to. The price is seventy
five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;



THE ORDERLY
Here's the rules; Rule    number one;
no punchin 'er.
Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got
'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,
jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches
under no circumstances.    And by the

way, this little cunt's a spitter -
it's a motor reflex thing but spit
or no, no punchin. Now are we
absolutely positively clear about
rule number one?



TWO TRUCKERS
Yeah.



THE ORDERLY
Rule number two;
No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
But after that, it's allll goooood.
Her plummin down there don't work
no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
try not to make a mess, and I'll be
back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.



THE ORDERLY
Oh by the way, not all the time,
but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
get drier than a bucket of sand.
If she dry, lube up with this and
you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
BLINKS.



GERALD
Hey Warren, she just blinked.



WARREN
He said she can't blink.



GERALD
I know what he said, I'm tellin ya

she just did.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.



WARREN
Just wait, when I get through with
this little dumbbell, she gonna
stand up and recite the Gettysburg
Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.



WARREN
Hey, Gerald.



GERALD
Yeah?



WARREN
This shit ain't no peep show. Go
out in the hall and I'll let ya
know when it's your turn.



GERALD
Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room?



WARREN
I can't get no errection wit you
lookin at me, so go on.



GERALD
Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.



INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

GERALD
He man, keep it down in there, I
can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.



INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.



ORDERLY
Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT
The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

SLAM!

SLAM!

SLAM!

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
FRAME.

The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.



THE BRIDE
Where's Bill?



THE ORDERLY
(hurt and confused)
Who?

SLAM!

He screams.

THE BRIDE
Bill! Where is Bill!



THE ORDERLY
I dunno no Bill.

SLAM!



THE BRIDE
I saw him here myself.....
SLAM!
....Now do you tell me where he is,
or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

SLAM!



THE ORDERLY
Please please stop, don't hit me
again!



THE BRIDE
Where is Bill?

SLAM!

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.



THE BRIDE
Where did you get this from?



THE ORDERLY
That's mine.

SLAM!



THE BRIDE
Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in
this room ten minutes ago.

SLAM!

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of

his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.



BUCK
Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
pie they all said you wuz. Well
Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;



THE BRIDE
Your name's Buck, right? And you
came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly
uniform.



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.



INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.



THE BRIDE
(monotone)
Wiggle your big toe.

Toe doesn't move an inch.



THE BRIDE
Wiggle your big toe.

It doesn't move.

THE BRIDE
Wiggle your big toe.
(VOICE OVER)
As I lay in the back of Buck's
pickup truck, trying to will my
limbs out of entropy, I could see
the faces of the cunts who did this
to me, and the dick responsible.
Members all of Bill's brainchild;
"The Deadly Viper Assassination
Squad."

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Now after five years of beauty
sleep I knew absolutely nothing
about my enemies' strengths
weakness or whereabouts. But as
fated by God vengeance would have
it, I who knew nothing - knew one
thing. As sure as God made little
green apples...

WE MOVE FAST TO O-REN ISHII'S SILHOUETTE, The SILHOUETTE
BECOMES A POSED PICTURE OF O-REN in all her Deadly Viper
glory.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
(continued)
....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name
on my Death List, was still
alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren
Ishii, made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of eleven.

FLASH ON
CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the
American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one
with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with
samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they
finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and
face of a stone.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
half-Japanese American Army brat
witnessed the murder of her Master
Sergeant father. And the rape, then
murder of her mother at the hands
of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza
boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
revenge...luckily for her, Boss
Matsumoto was a pedophile.

SHOCK CUT
O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS
CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl
uniform.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At thirteen, she got her revenge.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the
room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun
from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her

Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each
of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is
BLOWN OFF.

The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING
FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch

of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll
CROSSCUT....

....with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low-rent motel
called, "The Texican"....

...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk,
getting the key, and paying him out of the "BIG EL PASO
PIMPIN" wallet....

...her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room...

Shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store...

...conditioner...

...a bar of soap...

...hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet...

...steam rises off the hot bathwater...

...she pulls down a bunch of bath products, like bubble bath,
salts, apricot this - kiwi that, we see her pour all the
items in the bathwater...

...then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater...

...then Lower her whole body into the bathwater...

...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect
MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart
has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out
of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,
who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her
path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while
incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the
undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution
that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm
water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE
DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other
side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin
shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has
closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the
yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,
and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to
follow.

EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.



EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

pieces is a HIGH-POWERED, SCOPE-SIGHT RIFLE.

1 MANILA ENVELOPE.
She reaches in and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM.
There on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl. A
fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram
back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in
the locker she pulls out the final item,

1 SMALL KEY attached to a "DEALY VIPERS" KEY CHAIN.

She rolls up the weapons in the sleeping bag, and drives off.

The MAN From
OKINAWA


FADE UP ON



INT. SUSHI BAR (OKINAWA, JAPAN) - DAY

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese
curtain....

SUBTITLE APPEARS:


"The City of
OKINAWA, JAPAN"

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,
and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word
cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The
SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
English?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Almost -- American.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Ahhhh,...America, welcome...
Welcome... My English -- Very good.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She
doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest
assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,
American tourist.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Domo.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and
says;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,
you speak Japanese?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Nooo, just a few words I learned
since yesterday. - May I sit at the
bar?



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Sure sure sure - sit. What other
words did you learn - excuse me --

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to
imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling
to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
-- What other Japanese you learn?

The Bride puts on a thinking face.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Oh...let's see..."Arigato."



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
"Arigato"...Very good.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
..."Ah-So"...



SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
"Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So"
meansß



THE BRIDE
"I See."



SUSHI CHEF
I see - Very good.



THE BRIDE
I already said "Domo", right?



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Yes.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
"Kon-netie-wa."

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
"Kon-nichi-wa?"

Saying with surprise and admiration;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Most impressive...you say Japanese
words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

THE BRIDE
Now you're making fun of me.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
No no no - serious business.
Pronunciation - very good. You say
"Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
You should learn Japanese - very
easy.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
No kidding, I heard it's kinda
hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I always heard it was difficult.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
you have Japanese tongue.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Maybe I was Japanese in another
life.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Most definitely, most definitely
Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
How did you know tuna's my
favorite?



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Tuna's my favorite.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
(to the bald man)
I beg your pardon?

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
- Drink -



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Ahhh sake,
(he holds up his thumb)
Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
First time in Japan?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
A-huh.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Yes, this is my first time.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What brings you to Okinawa?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I came to see a man.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Aaahh, you have friend live in
Okinawa?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Not quite.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Not friend?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I've never met him.

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Who is he, may I ask?



THE BRIDE
Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;



SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
What do you want with Hattori
Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I need Japanese steel.



SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
Why do you need Japanese steel?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I have vermin to kill.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
You must have big rats you need
Hattori Hanzo steel.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Huge.



INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;



HANZO (ENGLISH)
Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...



HANZO (ENGLISH)
...try the second one down in the
sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
I wanted to show you these....
However someone as you, who knows
so much must surely know, I no
longer make instruments of death. I
keep these here for their ascetic
and sentimental value.
(he takes both sword and
sheath from her...)
Yet proud tho I am of my life's
work...
(...he closes them
together)
I am retired.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Then give me one of these.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
These are not for sale.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I didn't say, sell me. I said, give
me.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
And why should I be obliged to
assist you in the extermination of
your vermin?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Because my vermin, is a former
student of yours. And considering
the student, I'd say you had a
rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...You can sleep there...

.....starts to descend....



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...it will take me a week to make
the sword...

.....before his head disappears, he says;



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...I suggest you spend it
practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

FADE TO BLACK.



OVER BLACK
TITLE APPEARS:


"One week later"

Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo's voice in Japanese and
read the subtitles;



HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
I'm done doing what I swore an oath
to God 28 years ago to never do
again. I've created, "something
that kills people." And in that
purpose I was a success.

FADE UP ON



CU HATTORI HANZO



HANZO (JAPANESE)
I've done this, because
philosophically I'm sympathetic to
your aim.

EX CU The HANZO SWORD

TRACKING EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny, black wood
sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved
the face of a lioness...



HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
I can tell you with no ego, this is
my finest sword. If on your
journey, you should encounter God,
God will be cut.

CU HANZO.



HANZO (JAPANESE)
Revenge is never a straight line.
It's a forest. And like a forest
it's easy to lose your way...to get
lost...
to forget where you came in. To
serve as a compass, a combat
philosophy must be adopted that can
be found in the secret doctrine of
the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow
haired warrior, repeat after me;

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the
doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride
repeating it.



HANZO (JAPANESE)
"When engaged in combat, the
vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...This is the first and cardinal
rule of combat...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...Suppress all human emotion and
compassion...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)

...Kill whoever stands in thy way,
even if that be Lord God, or Buddha
himself...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)
This truth lies at the heart of the
art of combat. Once it is
mastered... Thou shall fear no
one... Though the devil himself may
bar thy way...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker
of swords on this earth and says;



THE BRIDE
Domo.

EX CU The Hanzo Sword,
her white hand with her long fingers COMES INTO FRAME and
removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance.

FADE TO BLACK.

Chapter Four

SHOWDOWN
at
HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES


CUT TO:

A BLANK PIECE    OF DRAWING PAPER
A hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image,
draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha
regaled O-REN    ISHII.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
When fortune smiles on something as
violent and ugly as revenge, at the
time it seems proof like no other,
that not only does God exist,
you're doing his will. At a time
when I knew the last about my
enemies, the first name on my death
list, was the easiest to find. But

of course,    when one manages the
difficult    task of becoming queen of
the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't
keep it a    secret, does one?

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning
into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At the age of twenty, Bill backed
his Nippon progeny financially and
philosophically in her
Shakespearian-in-magnitude power
struggle with the other Yakuza
clans, over who would rule vice in
the city of Tokyo.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER
YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the
real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
When it was all over, it was the
geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that
proved the victor.



INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the
city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO
BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with
much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
And just in case you're wondering
how could a half breed Japanese
Chinese American become the boss of
all criminal activity in Tokyo,
Japan,... I'll tell you. The
subject of O-Ren's blood and
nationality came up before the
council only once. The night O-Ren
assumed power over the crime
council.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the
alcohol-fueled frivolity.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
The man who seems bound and
determined to break the mood is
Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the
plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the
Tanaka Crime Family.



CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE)
Tanaka? What's the meaning of this
outburst? This is a time for
celebration.



BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
And what exactly should I be
celebrating? The perversion of our
illustrious council?

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains
cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it
for the rest of the sentence.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously
has something on his mind. Allow
him to express it.



BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
My father...
(looking at a clan head)
...along with yours and...
(looking at another)
...along With yours, started this
council. And while you drink like
fish and laugh like donkeys, they
weep in the afterlife over the
perversion committed today.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;



O-REN (JAPANESE)

Silence!
(then composed)
Of what perversion do you speak,
Tanaka?

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;



BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
perversion done to this council,
which I love more than my own
children,...by making a half
Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Drop them on the ground.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Get behind me.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Get on your knees.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.



O-REN
I'm going to say this in English so
you know how serious I am. As your
leader, I encourage you to -- from
time to time and always in a
respectful manner, and with the
complete knowledge that my decision
is final -- to question my logic.
If you're unconvinced a particular
plan of action I've decided is the
wisest, tell me so. But allow me to
convince you. And I will promise
you, right here and now, no subject
will be taboo...except the subject
that was just under discussion.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
(to a bodyguard)
Hand me that head.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.



O-REN (ENGLISH)

The price you pay for bringing up
either my Chinese or my American
heritage as a negative is, I
collect your fuckin head.
(now completely American)
Just like this fucker here. Now if
any of you sonsabitches got
anything else to say, now's the
fuckin time.

Nobody says anything.



O-REN (ENGLISH)
I didn't think so.
(pause)
Meeting adjourned.



EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.



INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
The mop tops in black suits and
Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
"The Crazy 88." The two young girls
in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
who's dressed like she's a villain
on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
finally, the American in the black
suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.



INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

END OF SHOT
BACK AND FORTH
between CU's of the two women, face to face.



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
(to Bride)
Can I help you?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yes, I am looking for the attorney
of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
that be you?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.



INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale

of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;



THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO
take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN
seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.



O-REN (JAPANESE)

You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.


The Bride
vs.
The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
we're going to have to close the
place. There's some private
business that we must attend to
now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;



O-REN
Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.



MIKI (JAPANESE)
You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT
Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN
standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN
smiles.



O   -REN (ENGLISH)
(to the     Bride)
You didn't     think it was going to be
that easy,     did you?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
(to O-Ren)
You know, for a second there, yeah
I did.

O-Ren smiles...



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...



O-REN/THE BRIDE
...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to

collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN
WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

GO GO
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Those    of you lucky enough to still
have    your lives. Take them with
you.    But leave the limbs you've
lost.    They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN
in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO
smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty
looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her
flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Any more subordinates for me to
kill, O-Ren?

Mr. Barrel says;



MR. BARREL
One last one.



THE BRIDE
You're Mr. Barrel, right?



MR. BARREL
And you're Black Mamba.



THE BRIDE
Our reputations precede us.



MR. BARREL
Apparently.

THE BRIDE
Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you
wear your Kato mask? Are you and
iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.



MR. BARREL
I don't like that rubber band. It
fucks up my hair.



THE BRIDE
You shouldn't work for her.



MR. BARREL
Too late.



THE BRIDE
It's not too late to quit.



MR. BARREL
Do you have choices?



THE BRIDE
No.



MR. BARREL
I know exactly how you feel.



THE BRIDE
This has nothing to do with You and
I, and everything to do with me
taking satisfaction from that bitch
behind you. And there's absolutely
positively no way I'M going to
leave here without taking that
satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you
have to stand aside. And that means
you must quit, right now.

MR. BARREL
I can't.



THE BRIDE
Yes you can.



MR. BARREL
No I can't.



THE BRIDE
Don't say "Can't", there are no
"Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN ISHII
Screams at her "...last line of defense;"



O-REN (ENGLISH)
What are you waiting for? Are you
on a date? Attack her you fool!



THE BRIDE
Oh my God...
(pause)
...She just called you a fool. She
just called you a fool in front of
me. Not only am I your opponent.
I'm a female fellow countryman.
And you're going to risk your life -
to say nothing of harming me - for
a woman who refers to you as a
fool?

O-REN
is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Attack, Goddamn you!

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;



THE BRIDE
I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;



MR. BARREL
The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;



MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left
hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn
room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel
with   the Bride, He stops and    says;



MR. BARREL
About that one you owe me.



THE BRIDE
Yes?



MR. BARREL
I'm gonna collect someday, you
know?



THE BRIDE
I'll be disappointed if you don't.

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

MR. BARREL
Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Very funny.
(pause)
Your instrument is quite
impressive.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Domo.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Where was it made?



THE BRIDE
Okinawa.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Whom in Okinawa made you this
steel?



THE BRIDE
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
YOU LIE!!

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Swords however never get tired. I
hope you've saved your energy. If
you haven't, you might not last
five minutes.
(pause)

Have you seen the garden in this
establishment?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
No.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Oh, you really should. It's quite
beautiful. Allow me.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
As last looks go, you could do
worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...



INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

O-REN'S FEET
White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN
when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play
with samurai swords. Bill might of
humored you, but you will find
neither humor nor mercy at my
blade. Now unless you intend to
commit sepeku among the koi, stand
up and fight. You may not be able
to fight like a samurai, but you
can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Attack me. With everything you
have.

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with

The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
I apologize for ridiculing you
earlier.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Accepted.

They continue breathing...



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Ready?



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Yes.

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in

CU O-REN ISHII
facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.



O-REN (ENGLISH)
That really was a Hattori Hanzo
sword...

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.



O-REN (ENGLISH)
I always dreamed of owning one...

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Did he make it for you?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Yes.

The Last thing she says before she dies;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
...He must of liked you.

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo
carved into the wood seems pleased.

CUT TO:

The BRIDE
now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her
head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

BLACK SCREEN
The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the
TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly
Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of
the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically
spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I've kept you alive for one reason.
Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,
I take it you're familiar with
Bill?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yes.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
In fact, I'd guesstimate, you
worked for Bill before O-Ren, and
that's how it is you came to work
for O-Ren. Am I correct?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I thought so. Give me the arm you
have left.



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Why?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I want information. Now gimme your
arm.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.



THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
The cocktail racing    through your
bloodstream at this    moment is
Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The
Undisputed Truth."

Sofie is injected.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Okay, first things first. Where was
the other Yubari sister? Yuki?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yuki's sick. She went home early.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Do tell? What's wrong with her?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
She has a cold.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Awwww poor baby. What do you think
she'll do when she finds out what
happened?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)

She'll wail with grief.

SHOCK CUT TO

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE



SOFIE
She'll drink excessively.

BACK TO YUKI
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE



SOFIE
She'll start trouble.

BACK TO YUKI
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in
a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the
make on her.



BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
Do you like Ferraris?

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Ferrari...Italian trash.

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the
business suit.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Do you find me hot?

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she
gets annoyed;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck
me, yes or no?

BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
Yes.

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short
sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,
creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up
more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
How bout now, big boy, do you still
wish to penetrate me...

Blade cuts deeper...



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Or is it I who has penetrated you.

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice
that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
When she stops shedding tears,
she'll start shedding blood.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Best guess, what will she do?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
I don't hafta guess, she'll come
after you.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Will she ever give up?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
She won't have to. When she finds

you, I don't know who will win. But
what I do know is, she will find
you.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Is she more skilled than I?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Skilled won't be the word.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Don't be coy with me, bitch. What
would be the word?



SOFIE
Crazy.

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Okay, now I want all the
information on the Deadly
Vipers,... What they've been doing
and where I can find them.



EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

CUT TO:

CU SOFIE
in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF
SCREEN;



BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so
sorry.

SOFIE (ENGLISH)
Please forgive my betrayal --

He shhhh's her off screen;



BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
-- no more of that. I invented that
truth serum. Once it entered your
bloodstream, you no longer had a
choice.



SOFIE (ENGLISH)
But, still --



BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
-- But still -- nothing, except my
aching heart over what she's done
to my beautiful and brilliant
Sofie.
(pause)
If you had to guess why she left
you alive, what would be your
guess?



SOFIE (ENGLISH)
Guessing won't be necessary. She
informed me.

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I'm allowing you to keep your
wicked life for one reason and one
reason only. So you can tell him,
in person, everything that happened
here tonight. I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy..., by
witnessing your deformed body. I
want you to tell him, all the
information you just told me. I
want him to know what I know. I
want him to know I want him to
know.

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to
the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
And I want them all to know,
they'll all soon be as dead as O
REN.

WE CUT TO A

CU of SOFIE
WE PAN to a CU of YUKI

Bill says off screen;



BILL (O.S.; JAPANESE)
If O-Ren was number one, unless
she's being tricky, Vernita Green
will be number two.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Where is Vernita Green?



BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)
Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena.
But the woman you want will hold up
in a low budget motel, fifteen of
twenty minutes away from stepping
on board a plane departing LAX. If
I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in
English;



YUKI (ENGLISH)
California, here I come.

What he's sewing is, the NASTY SLASH O-Ren gave the Bride on
her back, closed with a simple needle and thread.

CU The BRIDE
lies naked on her stomach, head up, chin resting on her
folded hand, feeling no pain at the needle piercing her
flesh. The sleeping giant is awake, and in her eyes we see
she's filled with a terrible resolve.

As Hanzo sews, he recites in Japanese the Yagu mantra, the
Bride recites in Japanese after him.

FULL SCREEN

We stay with Yuki's side as she stops across the street from
the Bride. During their face-off we only see the Bride at a
distance.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just
about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa!

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa.
(pause)
Yuki?



YUKI (ENGLISH)
Bingo!

THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.

The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Can I help you?



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You can kill yourself.

Yuki giggles.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Taking a trip?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I was.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You still are. One way.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I know you feel you must avenge
your sister. But I beg you...walk
away.

Yuki giggles.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You call that begging? You can beg
better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.



YUKI    (JAPANESE)
Can I see your    face? I've heard
your beauty is    exquisite. I would
like to see for    myself.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.



THE BRIDE
Domo.



YUKI    (JAPANESE)
Your face is so    pretty, I just want
to put both of    my palms against
your cheeks and    give you little
tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
How do I look?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Very pretty.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You're just saying that 'cause I
told you how pretty you are.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yuki, you're gorgeous.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Really? Is that how you'd describe
me to somebody if I wasn't here?
Yuki's gorgeous?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
You bet.

Yuki giggles.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Don't make me kill you.



YUKI (ENGLISH)
Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;



YUKI (ENGLISH)
You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.

The Bride yells at them;



THE BRIDE
Stay in your house and stay down on
the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Time for the rabbit to come out of
her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.



THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You fucking bitch! You shot me in
my breast! They're not fully
developed yet, you fucking asshole!
Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;



THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
Yuki, in about two    minutes there's
going to be an army    of police here.
So if you're gonna    kill me, now's
the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.



THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the

Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.



THE BRIDE
Goddamn, what a wildcat.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.



NURSE OWENS
Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.



THE BRIDE
Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --



NURSE OWENS
Who is this.



THE BRIDE
You don't know me, but --



NURSE OWENS
-- And I don't want to neither. Now

I don't know how you got my number,
but you can just rip that shit up,
because --



THE BRIDE
-- I've been shot five times --



NURSE OWENS
-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no
more. I got problems of my own.



THE BRIDE
I'm dying.



NURSE OWENS
Then bitch, you better call
yourself a ambulance, cause I don't
do this shit no more.



THE BRIDE
I can't call an ambulance.



NURSE OWENS
--    No, you can call a ambulance,
you    just don't want to. But if your
ass    is really dying, you ain't got
no    motherfuckin choice.



THE BRIDE
I do have a choice, and I'm
choosing to call you. If you refuse
to help me, I'll die. And that will
be your choice.



NURSE OWENS
Bitch, I don't even know you!



THE BRIDE
What do you need to know? I'm from
Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and
only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.



NURSE OWENS
Okay, where you at?



THE BRIDE
I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a
kids treehouse. It's a street
called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
Avenue. There's a bunch of police
cars and firetrucks, about two
blocks away.



NURSE OWENS
Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?



THE BRIDE
If you can't walk, you better
crawl.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.



NURSE OWENS
You got you some money dontcha, or
am I doin this out of the goodness
of my heart?



THE BRIDE
You come and get me, today's pay
day.



NURSE OWENS
You ain't too far away. You gonna
bleed to death I get there in a
half a hour?



THE BRIDE
Probably.



NURSE OWENS
Okay, I'll be there in fifteen
minutes.

THE BRIDE
Is that Pacific Standard Time, or
C.P.T.?



NURSE OWENS
Just you better be there    when I get
there, and you better be    shot five
times, and your bony ass    better be
on your last motherfuckin    legs.



THE BRIDE
How do you know I have a bony ass?



NURSE OWENS
You sound like you have a bony ass.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.



INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.



THE BRIDE
Glad you made it.



NURSE OWENS
There's cops all over here, I had
to be cool. They tend to notice
things like Negroes sneaking around
people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.



THE BRIDE
What's that?



NURSE OWENS
This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't
got no anesthetic.

(refers to the bottle)
So git busy.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT
The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;



THE BRIDE
That fuckin smarts.

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;



NURSE OWENS
Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
future, you should avoid them if
you can.



THE BRIDE
I'll keep that in mind. So, do I
have a future?



NURSE OWENS
You'll live to kill again.



THE BRIDE
Splendid.

She passes out.

FADE TO BLACK.

EX CU SLOT IN DOOR
is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side.



DOORMAN (O.S.)
Yes?



TWO EYES (O.S.)
I heard you had a game?



DOORMAN (O.S.)
Who are you?



TWO EYES (O.S.)
They call me Bill.



DOORMAN (O.S.)
Bill what?



BILL (O.S.)
That, no one ever calls me.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;



FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Open the door Alburt, let's see
what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.



L.F. O'BOYLE
Are you a policeman, Bill?



BILL
Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.



L.F.
Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



L.F.
(to the players)
We now return to the game already
in progress. The point is nine
gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



ALBURT
I'll take that.



BILL
You'll have to.

The two men stare...



L.F.
Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
intend to start any shit with that
sword?



BILL
I give you my word of honor, I will
start nothing.

L.F.
Good enough for me.
(back to game)



ALBURT
Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
dollar membership fee.



BILL
That's rather pricey.



ALBURT
You wanna play for free, go to
Vegas. You start now you'll be
there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



BILL
I think I'll stay here. I'm
thirsty.



ALBURT
That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



BILL
Beer.



BARTENDER
Twenty dollars.



BILL
Twenty dollars for a beer?



BARTENDER
High cost of living shooter. You
don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

get a prime rib dinner there for
3.95.



BILL
What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.
(throws a 20 on the bar)
Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



BILL
(pointing to the can)
I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



BILL
Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.



L.F.
Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid
in school wants    to play right away.
(to Bill)
How bout it new    kid, you wanna
handle my bones,    or do you just
like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...



BILL
I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.



L.F.
Boys take a look at this man, he's
what Webster's calls, a gambler.
The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

L.F.
I hope you're not implying
anything, friend?



BILL
(as he inspects dice)
I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.



ALBURT
That did it fuckhead, you're out
the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.



BILL
You looked me over when I stood in
your doorway. I'm looking you over
as I step up to your table. If I
don't know, I don't throw.



L.F.
Are you satisfied?



BILL
More or less.



L.F.
I think we're getting into a
antagonistic relationship.



BILL
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
trying to take my money, and I was
trying to take yours.

L.F.
It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.



BILL
If you're game, take my bet
sportsman.



L.F.
Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;



BILL
Shoot it all.

The room reacts.



L.F.
Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...



L.F.
The point is five, gentlemen, five
is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...



BILL
Shoot it all.



L.F.
Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;



BILL
Shoot it all.



L.F.
Pretty lucky tonight, huh?



BILL
Play a game of luck long enough
you're bound to meet some lucky
people.



L.F.
You know we've never been properly
introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.



BILL
And I'm not interested.



L.F.
No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
boy, I'm only trying to be
friendly.



BILL
I didn't come here to make friends.
I came here to shoot a little crap.
But then your boy over there hits
me up for a two hundred dollar
privilege to play fee --



L.F.
-- That's a membership fee, good
for --



BILL

-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.



L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?



BILL
I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm
through    with you,    you won't have a
pot to    piss, or a    window to throw
it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out
of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.



L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.



BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.



BILL

Oooohhh, that's....



L.F.
The house's perogative and you know
it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



L.F.
Maybe you would like to change your
bet?



BILL
Yes I would.....Shoot it
all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.



L.F.
What?



BILL
Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;



ALBURT
You can't do that.



BILL
Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
perogative, and she knows it.



L.F.
Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



BILL
Can I use your phone?



L.F.
Sure it's next to the bed.



INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.



L.F.
Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
out! No more tonight, go home....



BILL
(into phone)
Vernita's dead? When?
(pause)
What about her family?
(pause)
Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
completely apeshit. No idea where
she is?
(pause)
Okay that did it, we're going to
Texas and talk sense into Budd
before (BLEEP) makes him number
three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



BILL
We're going to have a talk about
this later.
(pause)

Well, I'm not exactly among friends
at the moment.
(pause...he laughs)
I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



BILL
Got a nose problem?



L.F.
I said you could use my phone. I
didn't say I wouldn't listen.



BILL
This is true.



L.F.
You didn't burn me down you know?



BILL
Course not. First rule of any
house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
comes in and wipes the place out
insurance.



L.F.
If there weren't losers it wouldn't
be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



BILL
I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
the real game was just beginning.
Bill was on the job, and she was
the target. Now Bill was the
greatest assassin of the 20th
century. In fact the term HITMAN
was coined for him. And he rarely
performs actual assassinations
anymore. However every once in
awhile - to keep his hand in - he
does. Only he plays a game. He
doesn't start big trouble...he lets
them start it. If they do, they're
dead. If they don't, not only won't
he perform, he'll take the hit off
the market. It's kind of fun
watching people gamble when they
don't know they're gambling, isn't
it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



L.F.
Get my money back. Don't kill him.
Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



BILL
Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



BILL
Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

"The city of
Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



BUDD
Great day in the morning. Brother
Bill livin up to his familia
obligation.



BILL
How ya doin' Budd?



BUDD
Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
mad rush of wild parties and
wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



BUDD
Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



BILL
It's Elle. Want to say hello?



BUDD
Never said "bye," can't seem to
think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.



BUDD
What'd ya wanna talk about?



BILL
Are you not going to invite me in?



BUDD
No.



BILL
May I ask why not?



BUDD
It stinks in there, that's why. Now
what's so important it requires a
reunion?

TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



BUDD
You tryin to tell me she cut her
way through eighty-eight bodyguards
'fore she got to O-Ren?



BILL
No. There wasn't really eighty
eight of them, they just called
themselves The Crazy 88.



BUDD
Why.



BILL

I dunno, I guess they thought it
sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
attacked. They all fell under her
Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



BUDD
She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



BILL
She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



BUDD
He made her one? Didn't he swear a
blood oath never to make another
sword?



BILL
It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



BUDD
Them Japs know how to carry a
grudge don't they? Or is it just
you tend to bring that out in
people?



BILL
(pause)
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask, but you by
any chance haven't kept up with
your swordplay?



BUDD
Hell, I pawned that years ago.



BILL
You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

BUDD
Yep.

The disrespect is pain.



BILL
It was priceless.



BUDD
Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
I got me 250 Dollars for it.



BILL
Since it was a gift from me, why
didn't you offer me the chance to
buy it back?



BUDD
Because that would've required me
to acknowledge your existence.
Drunken bum though I may be, I
don't need booze that bad. But who
the hell gives a crap anyway. That
bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
points for killin a white trash
piece of shit like me with a
samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
fight me, all she gotta do is come
down to the Club, start some shit,
and we'll be in a a fight.



BILL
-- Budd, you need to listen to me.
I know we haven't spoken for quite
some time, and the last time we
spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
you need to get over being mad at
me, and start becoming afraid of
Bea. Because she is coming, and
she's coming to kill you. And
unless you accept my assistance, I
have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

BILL
Can't we forget the past, and look
at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



BUDD
And what would that happy side be?



BILL
She's brought "the boys" back
together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



BUDD
I appreciate the concern on your
face, but there's a difference
'tween "the boys", time can't
erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
don't Jew outta payin my
comeuppance. That woman deserves
her revenge. And we deserve to die.
But then again, so does she. So I
guess we'll just see now, won't we.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



TED
You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



STRIPPER
Hey, Budd.



BUDD
Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



STRIPPER
Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
it again. There's shitty water all
over the floor.



BUDD
I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



THE BRIDE
Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



BUDD
Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



BUDD

You done got a double dose of rock
salt, right in the ole tit.
Now not havin tits as fine or as
big as yours, I can't even imagine
how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



BUDD
...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



BUDD
Now I know when it    comes to a rock
salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
much like a expert    bout now. But
truth be told, you    ain't felt all
rock salt's got to    offer till you
took a double dose    in your
backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



BUDD
That gentled ya down, didn't it?
Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
two barrels of rock salt dug deep
in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.



ELLE
Bill?



BUDD
Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.



ELLE
....Budd?



BUDD
Bingo.



ELLE
And what do I owe this dubious
pleasure?



BUDD
I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.



ELLE
Do you mean what I think you mean?



BUDD
If you think I mean I got 'er, you
thought right.

ELLE
Did you kill her?



BUDD
Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
it easy enough. She's so gentle
right now, I could preform her coup
de grace with a rock.



ELLE
What are you waiting for, run outta
liquid courage.



BUDD
No. It's just...I ain't killed
nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
Christ, kinda made me a promise I
wasn't gonna. Be that however it
is. Back when I did kill people...I
got paid for it. Just don't seem
right...turn amateur this time of
life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.



BUDD (O.S.)
Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.



BUDD
A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
sword. And I'm here to tell ya
Elle, that's what I call sharp.



ELLE
How much?



BUDD
Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
priceless and all.

ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.



BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.



ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?



BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.



ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?



BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.



ELLE
What's the terms?



BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?



ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One

condition.



BUDD
What?



ELLE
You kill her tonight.
(pause)
And one more thing.



BUDD
You said one condition.



ELLE
It's a caveat to the same
condition.



BUDD
What?



ELLE
She must suffer to her last breath.



BUDD
That Elle darlin, I can pretty
damwell guarantee.



ELLE
Then I'll see you in the morning
millionaire.

CUT TO:



OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



BUDD
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



BUDD (SPANISH)
Look at those eyes. This bitch is
furious. You grab her feet, I'll
get her head.
(ENGLISH)
Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



BUDD (SPANISH)
In America white women call this
the silent treatment.
(laughing)
And we let 'em think, we don't like
it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



BUDD
Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



BUDD
Looky here bitch, this is a can of
mace. Now you're goin underground
tonight, and that's all there is to
it. But, when I bury ya, I was
gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

BUDD
But if    you're gonna act like    a
horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
alive.    So what's it gonna be
sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



BUDD
You may be stupid, but at least you
ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



THE BRIDE
Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.

THE BRIDE
Well, now that you've had a nice,
good cry, let's figure out how to
get out of here? You're breathing
like you just been fuckin. Calm
down...close your mouth, and start
breathing short breaths, through
your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's a lot better. But you're
still too agitated. Can you hear
your heart? It's like I'm buried
alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
you can. The darkness will have a
calming effect. Now turn off that
fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.



INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.



BUDD
(into phone)
Yellow?



INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.



ELLE
Didja do it?



BUDD
Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK FRAME
TITLE APPEARS:


Chapter eight

"The cruel tutelage
of Pai Mei"


FADE UP ON



EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:


"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



BILL (V.O.)
Once upon a time in China, some
believe around the year, one-double
knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."

BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
...head priest of The White Lotus
Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
road, contemplating whatever a man
with Pai Mei's infinite power would
contemplate -- Which is another way
of saying, who knows. When, a
Shaolin monk appeared on the road
traveling in the opposite
direction. As the monk and the
priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity, gave the
monk the slightest of nods. The
nod, was not returned. Was it the
intention of the Shaolin monk to
insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
fail to see the generous social
gesture?
The motives of the monk, remain,
unknown. What is known, were the
consequences. The next morning Pai
Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
and demanded that the temple's head
Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
repay the insult. The Abbot, at
first, tried to console Pai Mei,
only to find, Pai Mei was
inconsolable. So began, the
massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
all sixty of the monks inside, at
the fists of the White Lotus. And
so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
Technique.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
exploding heart technique?



BILL (V.O.)
Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
all of the martial arts. He hits
you with his fingertips, at ten
different pressure points on your
body. And then, he lets you walk
away. But once you've taken five
steps, your heart explodes inside
your body, and you fall to the
floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then

fall to the floor dead.



EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY

Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.



THE BRIDE
Did he teach you that?



BILL
No. He teaches no one the ten-point
palm - exploding heart technique.
But he is Nietzsche's psalm
personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
kill you, he will make you
stronger. Now one of the things I
always liked about you, Kiddo, is
you appear wise beyond your years.
Then allow me to impart, a word to
the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
him - even for an instant - a
defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
And if you throw any American sass
his way, he will snap your back and
your neck like they were twigs, and
that will be the story of you.



EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.



BILL
He'll accept you as his student.

THE BRIDE
Caught him in a good mood, aye?



BILL
More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.



BILL
Just seeing those steps again makes
me ache. You're gonna have plenty
of fun carrying buckets of water up
and down that fucker.



THE BRIDE
Why did he accept me?



BILL
Because he's a very very very old
man. And like all rotten bastards,
when they get old, they become
lonely. Not that that has any
effect on their disposition. But
they do learn the value of company.



THE BRIDE
When will I see you again?



BILL
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the Seventies.



THE BRIDE
What?



BILL
Nothing. When he tells me you're
done.

THE BRIDE
When do you think that might be?



BILL
That my dearest, all depends on
you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
sarcasm.
Least not for the first year.
You're going to have to let him
warm up for you. He hates
Caucasians, despises Americans, and
has nothing but contempt for women,
so in your case, that may take a
little while. Adios.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.



INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.



THE BRIDE
(yelling)
Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;



PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.



THE BRIDE
(to herself)
More stairs, Jesus Christ.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
If it is Christ you seek, turn back
now.

She climbs the wooden staircase.



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.



THE BRIDE *
Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
student --

Pai Mei is still unseen.



PAI MEI'S VOICE *
Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
understand a single word you say.
It causes my ears discomfort. You
are not to speak unless spoken to.
Do you understand Mandarin any
better than you speak it?



THE BRIDE *
I speak Japanese very well --



PAI    MEI'S VOICE *
I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,
or Mongolian,    for that matter. I
asked if you    understand Mandarin?



THE BRIDE *

A little, I am still learning.



PAI MEI'S VOICE *
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you
can't understand me, I will
communicate with you like I would a
dog. When I yell, when I point,
When I beat you with my stick!

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI
He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.



PAI MEI *
Bill is your master, is he not?



THE BRIDE *
Yes, he is.



PAI MEI *
Your master tells me you're not
entirely unschooled. What training
do you possess?



THE BRIDE *
I am proficient in a combination of
Tiger and Crane style. And I am
more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.



PAI MEI *
(he makes a SNORTING
SOUND)
The exquisite art of the samurai
sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
called exquisite art, is only fit
for Japanese fat heads. You really
are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

PAI MEI *
Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.



THE BRIDE *
I'm sorry master --



PAI MEI *
-- Silence! I do not wish to hear
your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...



PAI MEI *
Your anger amuses me. Do you
believe you are my match?



THE BRIDE *
No.



PAI MEI *
Are you aware I kill at will?



THE BRIDE *
Yes.



PAI MEI *
Is it your wish to die?



THE BRIDE *
No.



PAI MEI *
Then you must be stupid. Rise
stupid, and let me get a better

look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;



PAI MEI *
You breathe hard. The one hundred
steps robbed you of your wind. So
your stupidity is matched only by
your weakness. Is there anything
you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
Japs. I would of thought an
American would be immune to their
pompous posturing. Apparently I was
wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.



PAI MEI *
Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.



PAI    MEI *
Let's see how    good you really are.
Try and land    a blow. If you land a
single blow,    I'll bow down and call
you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

PAI MEI *
Come now woman, can't you even hit
an old man?

She tries more...



PAI MEI *
Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.



PAI MEI *
Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
cripples who posed more of a
challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;



PAI MEI *
From here you can get an excellent
view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.



PAI MEI *
Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,

that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.



PAI MEI *
That blade's sharp. Careful not to
cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...



PAI MEI *
If you can't fight any better than
that, what use do you have for a
leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.



PAI MEI *
Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

PAI MEI *
Your swordsmanship is amateur at
best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.



PAI MEI *
I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
and you can't even make me break a
sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.



PAI MEI *
Let's see your Tiger and Crane
style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;



PAI MEI *
...pathetic.....terrible...you
idiot, you should've landed that
blow...you call that crane?...
Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.



PAI MEI *
I asked you to show me what you
know, and you did. Not a goddamn
thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....



PAI MEI *
Like all yankee women, the only
thing you know how to do is order

in restaurants and spend a man's
money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.



PAI MEI *
Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;



THE BRIDE *
Yes!



PAI MEI *
I could chop off your arm at will.
I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;



THE BRIDE
No please don't!



PAI MEI *
If you wish to speak romantic
languages, you've come to the wrong
place.



THE BRIDE *
Please don't cut my arm off!



PAI MEI *
It's my arm now. I can do with it
what I please. If you can stop me,
I suggest you try.



THE BRIDE *
I can't!

PAI MEI *
Because you're helpless?



THE BRIDE *
Yes!



PAI MEI *
Have you ever felt this before?



THE BRIDE *
No!



PAI MEI *
Compared to me you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't
you?



THE BRIDE *
Yes!!!



PAI MEI *
THAT'S THE BEGGING!

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.



PAI MEI *
Is it your wish to learn how to
make others as helpless as you
were?



THE BRIDE *
Yes.



PAI MEI *
Can you cook?



THE BRIDE *
Yes.

PAI MEI *
I'll be the judge of    that.
(pause)
Draw me a bath...your    training will
begin tomorrow. That    arm is still
mine. You may lose it    yet.

TIME CUT



EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;



PAI MEI *
Since your arm now belongs to me, I
want it strong. Can you do that?



THE BRIDE *
I can, but not that close.



PAI MEI *
Then you can't do it.



THE BRIDE *
I can put my hand through that at
six inches.



PAI MEI *
And you could shoot a man from a
rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
if you so desired, but this is not
what I asked. What if your enemy is
three inches in front of you, what
do you do then? Curl into a ball?
Or do you put your fist through
him.

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

PAI MEI *
Now begin.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....



INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.



PAI MEI *
If you want to eat like a dog, I
will make you live and sleep like a
dog. Outside. If you want to live
and sleep like a human being, pick
up those sticks.

She does.



THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.



PAI MEI *
It's the wood that       should fear your
hand, not the other       way around. No
wonder you can't do       it, you
acquiesce to defeat       before you even
begin.

He walks off in a huff.



EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

PAI MEI *
In that pit, is a rat.

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.



PAI MEI *
In the sky, is a bird.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.



PAI MEI *
You are to go into that pit, and
catch that rat, with your bare
hands. If you catch the rat, I will
deem you the victor, and tonight
you will dine on bird. But, if you
can't catch the rat by sundown,
I'll deem the victor the rat. And
because of the disgrace to my
student, I will be forced to kill
it. And then I will force you, to
consume his body. Because to be my
student, you must develop a taste
for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.

THE BRIDE *
I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
this rat. However, I will not eat
this filthy vermin. What I will
do...
(she RIPS the rat open
like a pomegranate)
...is consume his victorious heart.
(she snatches the tiny
heart from the rodent's
carcass. Holding it
between her fingers.)
But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;



PAI MEI *
How does victory taste?



THE BRIDE *
Bitter.

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.



THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Wow!



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he
hears a noise.



PAI MEI *
Woman, is that you who disturbs my
meditation?

She answers from outside the door;

THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)
Yes, teacher.



PAI MEI *
Enter.

She does, bowing to one knee.



PAI MEI *
What news do you find so worthy, as
to disrupt my bath?



THE BRIDE *
I did it teacher. I put my fist
through the wall.

TIME CUT

PAI MEI and the BRIDE
looking at the hole in the wall.



PAI MEI *
Very good. Would you care to
demonstrate?

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her
right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where
she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the
wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no
expression.



THE BRIDE *
I think you watching is making me
nervous.



PAI MEI *
Not only that, it has you speaking
before you were spoken to. Try
again.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI
he says in ENGLISH;



PAI MEI
Impressive.

She immediately goes down to her knees;



THE BRIDE *
Thank you teacher --

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.



PAI MEI *
You still fight better than you
speak. Finally, a woman who
understands what's important.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.



PAI MEI *
Begin again.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no
effect....starting all over.

CUT TO:



BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.



EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the

tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.



INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;



THE BRIDE
I'd like a glass of water.

FADE TO BLACK.

"ELLE and I"


CUT TO:

CU ELLE DRIVER
Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving
full out on top of the desert's surface. Spanish Rock coming

out of her powerful speakers.



EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.



BUDD
Want some breakfast?



INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.



ELLE
...So that's called a Texas
funeral?



BUDD
Yep.



ELLE
I got to give it to ya Budd, that's
a pretty fucked up way to die.
What's the name on the grave she's
buried under?



BUDD
Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.



ELLE

Can I look at the sword?



BUDD
That's my money in that black case,
isn't it?



ELLE
Sure is.



BUDD
Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.



ELLE
So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.



BUDD
That's a Hanzo sword alright.



ELLE
Bill tells me you once had one of
your own.

Pause.



BUDD
Once.



ELLE
How does this one compare to that
one?



BUDD
If you're gonna compare a Hanzo
sword, you compare it to every

sword ever made -- wasn't made by
Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips
around this.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.



BUDD
So, which "R" you filled with?



ELLE
What?



BUDD
They say the number one killer of
old people is retirement. People
got'em a job to do, they tend to
live a little longer so they can do
it. I've always figured warriors
and their enemies share the same
relationship. So now you ain't
gonna hafta face your enemy on the
battlefield no more, which "R" are
you filled with, Relief or Regret?



ELLE
A little bit of both.



BUDD
Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a
little bit of both. But I know damn
well you feel one more than you
feel the other. The question was
which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;



ELLE
Regret.



BUDD
Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'
girl. I never saw nobody buffalo
Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
Bill useta think she was so damn
smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,
she's just smart for a blonde.

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.



ELLE
Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.



BUDD
Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.



ELLE
Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
to introduce my friend, The Black
Mamba.
(gesturing towards the
refridgerator)
Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
know before I picked up that little
fella, I looked him up on the
internet.
(she removes her notepad
from her pocket)

Fascinating creature the Black
Mamba. Listen to this,
(reading from the notepad)
"...In Africa, the saying goes, in
the bush, an elephant can kill you.
A leopard can kill you. And a Black
Mamba can kill you. But only with
the Mamba, and this has been true
in Africa since the dawn of time,
is death sure. Hence its handle;
Death Incarnate."
(looking up from the
paper)
Pretty cool, huh?
(back to paper)
"...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,
acting on the nervous system
causing paralysis. The venom of a
Black Mamba can kill a human in
four hours, if say bitten on the
ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
to the face or torso can bring
death from paralysis within twenty
minutes.
(up from paper to Budd)
Now you should listen to this cause
this concerns you.
(reading from the paper)
The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bit can be
gargantuan.
(looks up from paper)
-- You know I've always liked that
word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
have an opportunity to use it in a
sentence.
(back to paper)
"If not treated quickly with anti
venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
fatal to human beings. However, the
Black Mamba can deliver as much as
100 to 400 milligrams of venom from
a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.



ELLE
Now in these last agonizing minutes
of life you have left, let me
answer the question you asked
earlier, more thoroughly. When it
comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
"R's" in me. Revenge is one.
Retribution is another. Rivalry is
definitely one. But I got another

"R" for that bitch you might be
surprised to find out. Respect. But
right at this moment, the biggest
"R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that
maybe the greatest warrior I have
ever met, met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky
piece of shit like you. The woman
deserved better.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her
cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.



ELLE
(into phone)
Bill...Elle. I have some tragic
news.
(pause)
Your brother's dead.
(pause)
I'm sorry baby.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places
her foot over his mouth.



ELLE (CONT'D)
She put a Black Mamba in his
camper.
(pause)
I got her, sweety.
(pause)
She's dead.
(pause)
Let me put it this way. If you ever
start feeling sentimental, go to
Austin, Texas. When you get here,
walk into a florist and buy a bunch
of flowers. Then you take those
flowers to Huntington cemetery on
Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the
headstone marked "Paula Schultz",
then lay them on the grave. Because
you will be standing at the final
resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

(pause)
Okay, I'm leaving now, go smoke

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man
under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on
her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA
out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;



ELLE
Bring it on, bitch.

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the
blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED
from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.



ELLE
Now that's what I call sharp.



EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....

WHEN...

...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...

ELLE'S POV:

red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see

coming at her at 100 MPH...

CRASH

The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body
greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor
from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in
particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could
be.

FLASH ON
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE.

The BRIDE'S POV:
She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...
SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE
searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,
resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes
it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.



EXT. DESERT

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.



ELLE
Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
alacky had got the best of you.



THE BRIDE
You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.



ELLE
(referring to the sword)
What's that?



THE BRIDE
Budd's Hanzo sword.



ELLE
He said he pawned it.



THE BRIDE
Guess that makes him a liar, don't
it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.



THE BRIDE
(question)
Elle?

ELLE
(answer)
Bea.



THE BRIDE
I was wondering, just 'tween us
girls, what did you say to Pai Mei
for him to snatch out your eye?

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE

ELLE
I called him a bastard.



THE BRIDE
Oooh, not so good.



ELLE
Were I to do it over again, I'd
bite my tongue.



THE BRIDE
One more question?



ELLE
Shoot.



THE BRIDE
Where's Bill?



ELLE
Villa Quatro.



THE BRIDE
Gulf of Mexico?

Elle nods her head 'yes.'

THE BRIDE
You wouldn't lie to me now?



ELLE
Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.



THE BRIDE
I saw what you did to that little
Mamba in there. Want to try that on
somebody your own size?




ELLE
I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.



THE BRIDE
Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before
we get started. Hattori Hanzo
swords are extremely sharp. They
can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.
Careful not to cut your own arm
off.



ELLE
I don't rattle, bitch!

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.



THE BRIDE
You're gonna bleed though, you're
gonna bleed a lot.

THEN...

separating. We don't know who's cut.

The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if
it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds.

We feel a count of...One Mississippi...

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle.

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its
TIP.

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,

BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.

Why don't you put it on the dinner

Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;



BILL
Oh and Josephina, take the
remaining flowers and spread them
around the house, if you would.

JOSEPHINA
Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.



BILL
You know I just had a great idea.
Take the roses, and spread the
petals on the bed I just got for
her. That'd be a nice thing to come

hear a SPANISH TRAGIC LOVE BALLAD, coming from the car radio.

BILL
driving his convertible as the beach WHIZZES by in the
background.

The Bride's eye.

Dirt Road, lined by greener than green trees, the Porsche
kicks up dirt ZOOMING down it.

CU BILL
driving as the Spanish love song plays.

The Bride's eye.

A striking but antiseptic-looking INSTITUTION of some sort,
surrounded by the beautiful foliage of Mexico. Bill's silver
Porsche drives up its driveway.

The Bride's eye.



INT. INSTITUTION

The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the
Bride's perspective. The SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER
and TIGHTER as we look through the Bride's POV and listen to
her VO;



THE    BRIDE (V.O.)
The attentive    audience members
among you will    have probably
noticed, that    all my kills have
been straight    up fights.

The Bride's POV: The Glass-enclosed Institution, and Bill
standing by himself in the empty lobby.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Y'all figured I'd face him with my

Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured
Bill figured the same thing. I am
the product of three godfathers.
Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
Different teachers teach you
different things. But one thing I
learned from all three, was "in
combat, the opponent that does the
unexpected, can usually expect to
be the victor." Bill would never
see this coming. Not from me. And
least any of you judge me a
bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long    white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

WIDE SHOT
looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
SIGHT.

SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

FLASH ON
The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.



EXT. LONG LONG LONG EMPTY ROAD IN MEXICO - DAY

Silence, except for a few birds.

THEN...

WE HEAR the Roaring of an Engine, and the Silver Porsche
WHIZZES into FRAME.



INT. PORSCHE (MOVING) - DAY

Bill behind the wheel, his little girl asleep in the
passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.



BILL
Hola.



INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long
blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first
time in five years and six months.



THE BRIDE
Hello Bill.



BILL
Kiddo, is that really you?



THE BRIDE
Oh, it's me all right.



BILL
I hear you were driving a truck?



THE BRIDE
My pussy wagon died on me. Who's
your little friend?

He glances down at the sleeping child.



BILL
Oh, you mean the little tow head
next to me, who looks
extraordinarily like you?



THE BRIDE
Yeah, that one.



BILL
Her name is B.B.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.



THE BRIDE
B.B.?



BILL
Yes. Do you approve?

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,
fingertips rest on scar.



THE BRIDE
Yes. Can she hear us?



BILL
Not now, she's in dream land.



THE BRIDE
How old is she?



BILL
What do you mean by that?



THE BRIDE
How many years has she been alive?

BILL
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if
she's five.



THE BRIDE
Is she five?



BILL
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you
supposed to automatically know?



THE BRIDE
I did and I do.
(pause)
I want to meet her.



BILL
Have dinner with us at my hacienda
tonight. She's expecting you.



THE BRIDE
What do you mean?



BILL
I knew you were on your way, so I
told B.B. Her mommy was coming to
see her.



THE BRIDE
(confused)
What have you told her about me?



BILL
That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a

picture of you --



THE BRIDE
-- which one?



BILL
The one I took of you in Paris,
sitting on the steps with the
baguette in your hand. Since she
was one and a half years old, she's
slept with that picture of you next
to her bed.

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then
DISSOLVES AWAY.



THE BRIDE
You know, prettier photos of me do
exist.



BILL
And she's seen them. But the one
she wants looking after her while
she sleeps is the one of you
holding bread.
(pause)
We normally have dinner around
seven, is that convenient?



THE BRIDE
Yes.

Pause....The cars get closer...



THE BRIDE
When do we cross swords?



BILL
Well, it just so happens, my
hacienda comes with its very own
private beach. And my private
beach, just so happens to look
particularly beautiful bathed in
moonlight. And there just so
happens to be a full moon out
tonight. So, swordfighter, if you

want to sword fight, that's where I
suggest. But if you wanna be old
school about it - then we can wait
till dawn, and slice each other up
at sunrise, like a couple real life
honest to goodness samurais. As per
usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...



THE BRIDE
Do me a courtesy?



BILL
Anything.



THE BRIDE
Slow down as we pass...I want
another look at her.



BILL
Wear something nice tonight?



THE BRIDE
I have a dress all picked out.



BILL
Will I like it?



THE BRIDE
You said I looked beautiful last
time you saw me in it.



BILL
I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;



THE BRIDE
You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.



BILL
Now you just wait one second there
little missy. Unless I'm confused,
we are trying to kill each other
aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
taking a shot at you in front of
the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
if you're gonna forget everything I
ever taught you, and gawk like you
ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
take a shot, am I not?



THE BRIDE
Did she wake up?



BILL
Of course not. She's like you that
way.
I look forward to this evening. It
was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.



INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
(in phone; groggy)
Hello....



INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Hattori!



HANZO (ENGLISH)
Beatrix, what's wrong?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

CUT TO:



INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.



HANZO (JAPANESE)
Half of Bill's strength, lies in
his talent for the unexpected.
If you intend to vanquish this man,
and claim your daughter, you must
not only expect the unexpected. You
must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.



INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.



THE BRIDE
Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.



THE BRIDE
Hello Josephina.



JOSEPHINA
Hello Miss Beatrix.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.



THE BRIDE
Stay in here and don't come out. If
you leave this room I'll shoot you,
comprende?



JOSEPHINA
Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Kiddo! If you're through shooting
the servants, I'm in the living
room. You remember how to get to
the living room, don'tcha? Go down
to the end of the hall, and make a
left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;



BILL
(loudly)
Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.

BILL
Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.



BILL
Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.



B.B.
Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;



BILL
Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;



BILL
You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.



BILL
But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
know,...that five-year-old B.B.
Gunn was only playing possum, due
to the fact she was impervious to
bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;



B.B.

(to Mommy)
I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.



BILL
(to B.B.)
Hey, get back down there, you're
playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;



BILL
So, as the smirking killer
approached, what she thought, was a
bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;



B.B.
Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;



BILL
Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.



THE BRIDE
Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.



B.B.
Don't die Mommy, I was just
playing.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.



MOMMY
I know baby.

They embrace each other.



B.B.
I waited a long time for you to
wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
- I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;



THE BRIDE
Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.



THE BRIDE
Now let me look at you. My my my...
What a pretty girl you are.



B.B.
You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.



THE BRIDE
Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.



BILL
When I showed you Mommy's picture,
tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.



BILL

C'mon shy girl, you know what you
said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;



B.B.
I said - I said - You're the most
beautiful woman I ever saw in the
whole white world.



BILL
That's the truth. That's what she
said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.



B.B.
What's that?



MOMMY
Oh, Mommy spilled something on her
dress.



B.B.
Blood?



MOMMY
No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?



B.B.
No.



BILL
Do you not like it, or do you not
know what it is?

Parroting Bill;



B.B.
I do not know what it is.

MOMMY
Well, it's a very tasty beverage
that I used to drink, when I was a
little girl. It comes in a lot of
different flavors and colors, and
it's really good. Maybe we should
fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.



BILL
Speaking of fixing and drinking and
eating, I think it's dinner time
don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.



BILL
(to Mommy)
When you were doin all that fancy
shootin, you didn't happen to shoot
a nice Mexican woman about forty
five years old, did ya?



MOMMY
No.



BILL
(wiping imaginary sweat
off his brow)
Whew, then dinner should be done.
(shouting to the other
room)
Josephina! You can come out now,
we're ready for dinner.



JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;



BILL
Want to go on top of the world?

She says excitedly;



B.B.
Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.



INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.



BILL
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide
world?



B.B.
Yes I do.



BILL
In fact it's better than pretty.
What's better than pretty?



B.B.
Gorgeous.



BILL
Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
gorgeous.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.



BILL
You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at
Daddy.



B.B.

Why? Where you a bad daddy?



BILL
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
(to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
(to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?



B.B.
I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.



BILL
Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?



B.B.
I stepped on him.



BILL
Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?



B.B.
Yeah.



BILL
To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
(beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the

carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?



B.B.
He was -- flapping.



BILL
And then you stomped on him?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
And when you lifted your foot up,
what was Emilio doing then?



B.B.
Nothing.



BILL
He stopped flapping, didn't he?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
And you knew what that meant,
didn't you?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
What did that mean?

B.B.
He was dead.



BILL
(to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they

can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
(to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.



B.B.
You stomped on Mommy?



BILL
Worse.
(making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.



B.B.
Why?



BILL
I don't know.



B.B.
Did you want to see what would
happen?



BILL
No, I   knew what   would happen to
Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't
know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what
would   happen to   me.



B.B.
What happened?

BILL
I was very sad. And that was when I
learned, somethings once you do,
they can never be undone.



B.B.
What happened to Mommy?



BILL
Why don't you ask Mommy.



B.B.
Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?



BILL
No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.



B.B.
Did it make you sick?



MOMMY
It put me to sleep. That's why I
haven't been with you B.B., I've
been asleep.



B.B.
But you're awake now, right?



MOMMY
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.



EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.



BILL
Did she go to sleep easy?



THE BRIDE
It took her a little bit. She was
excited. She's quite the little
chatterbox.



BILL
Well, if she doesn't like you, you
got to kill her to say hello. But
if she likes you, you can't shut
her up. She's a chip off the ole
blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.



BILL
Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.



BILL
C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
fun with a couple glasses of wine
in ya.

She gives him a look.



BILL
(pointing towards the
beach)
We're going to go out there and
have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.



BILL
Well, I've already had    a glass. So
unless you want to win    by an unfair
advantage, you should    have a glass
of wine. So we're both    on the same
footing wine wise.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.



BILL
You know, there's an old man down
here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
He was a pimp. I knew him when I
was a child. He was a friend of my
mother's. I told him about you.
When I showed him your picture he
smiles and said;
(imitating his accent)
"Yesss, I see the attraction." He
told me a story about taking me to
the movies when I was five. It was
a movie which had Lana Turner in
it. And whenever she would appear
on screen, he said I would stick my
thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
an obscure amount. And he knew
right then, this boy will be a fool
for blondes.



THE BRIDE
Who would of ever thought you'd be
such a good father?



BILL
Well not you, that's for damn sure.

She gives him another look.



THE BRIDE
Must we have to endure your little
zingers?



BILL
No we mustn't. But if you're going
to say sentences like that, in the
future, I will resist the
temptation.



THE BRIDE
Baby, you don't have a future.

Bill drinks some wine.

BILL
I sent you to L.A. and you never
came back. I thought you'd been
killed. Do you know how cruel it is
to make someone think someone they
love is dead? I mourned you. Then
in the third month of my mourning,
I track you down. I wasn't trying
to track you down, I was trying to
track down - the fucking assholes -
who I thought killed you. And when
I find you, what to I find? Not
only are you not dead, you're
getting married - to some fuckin
jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
you expect me to react?



THE BRIDE
Why do you think I hid?



BILL
Why did you leave in the first
place? You have cold eyes towards
me now. I understand their
temperature, but they were warm the
second to the last time I saw them,
or was that just my imagination?



THE BRIDE
No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
You sent me to L.A. to kill that
lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.



BILL (ENGLISH)
You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?



BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.



THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.



BILL
But you never did.



THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.



BILL
My apologies, please continue.



THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to

kill me in my hotel room. As I was
dancing in euphoria, the killer
came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;



THE BRIDE
Hello, can I help you?



HOTEL WOMAN
Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
hospitality manager of the hotel. I
have a welcome gift from the
management.

Seeing it through the peephole.



THE BRIDE
Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
busy at this second, could you
possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.



KAREN
So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...



THE BRIDE
Wait a second!

Karen stops.



THE BRIDE
Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
come here to kill your sister. But
I'm not gonna do that now.



KAREN
Oh, I know you're not --



THE BRIDE
- listen to me! I just found out,
right now - not two minutes before
you blew a hole in the door, I'm
pregnant.

Karen looks at her, "what?".



THE BRIDE
On that table is the    home pregnancy
kit. On the floor by    the door is
the strip that says    I'm pregnant.
I'm telling you the    truth, I don't
want to and I won't    kill your
sister. I just want    to go home.

KAREN
What is this, bullshit story number
twelve in the female assassin's
handbook?



THE BRIDE
Any other time you'd be a hundred
percent right. But this time you're
a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
deadliest woman in the world, but
right now I'm scared shitless for
my baby. Please, you hafta believe
me. Look at the strip, it's on the
floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.



KAREN
Sit down on that bed and put your
hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.



THE BRIDE
Blue means pregnant.



KAREN
I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.



KAREN
Okay, say I were to believe you,
what then?



THE BRIDE
Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;

KAREN
You fucked with the Wong sisters.



BACK ON THE PORCH



THE BRIDE
Facing Karen Wong, was the most
frightening moment I have ever
experienced. And that includes
three years with that evil bastard
Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
blue, I was a woman, I was your
woman. I was a killer, who killed
for you. Before that strip turned
blue, I would have jumped a
motorcycle on to a speeding train
...for you. But once that strip
turned blue, I could no longer do
any of those things. Not anymore.
Because now I was a mother. A
mother who only had one thought on
her mind. Please don't harm my
baby. Can you understand that?



BILL
Yes. But why tell me now, and not
then?



THE BRIDE
You wouldn't have let me go.
Specially once you found out I was
pregnant. You would've tried to
talk me out of it. It would have
been a big scene. I just said fuck
it.

Starting to get mad.



BILL
Fuck who?



THE BRIDE
Bill, you couldn't know I was
pregnant, once you knew, you'd
claim it, and I didn't want that.

BILL
That's not your decision to make.



THE BRIDE
Yes, but it's the right decision.
And I made it for my daughter.
Everybody on this earth deserves to
start with a clean slate. But with
us - my daughter would be born into
a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
her of the one thing everybody
deserves. She would be born with
blood stains. I had to choose. I
chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.



THE BRIDE
You know five years ago, if I had
to make a list of impossible things
that could never happen.
You performing a coup de grace on
me by bustin a cap in my crown,
would be right at the top of the
list.
(beat)
I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

Bill listens stoney, then;



BILL
I'm sorry was that a question? Of
impossible things that could never
happen - yes in this instance you
would have been wrong.

The Bride listens stoney, then;



THE BRIDE
Well?



BILL
Well what?



THE BRIDE
Explain yourself.

BILL
I already have. When I told you the
story of when I thought you were
dead. Didn't you get how badly I
felt?



THE BRIDE
You call that an explanation?



BILL
Well if that's too cryptic let's
get literal.
(beat)
There are consequences to breaking
the heart of a murdering bastard.
You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.



THE BRIDE
You and I have unfinished business.



BILL
Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.



BILL
You know how proud I am of you,
don't you?



THE BRIDE
Yes.



BILL
You know I was rooting for you,
don't you?

THE BRIDE
I figured.



BILL
You know on that beach out there I
want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.



BILL
You also know you're going to have
to defeat me. I can't just give it
to you, even though I want to.



THE BRIDE
It won't be necessary for you to
give me anything. I've surpassed
you. I'll take it.



BILL
Well, as they say in Missouri, show
me.



EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right

empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.



BILL
(to himself)
That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.



BILL

He taught you the ten point palm
exploding heart technique?



THE BRIDE
Of course he did.



BILL
Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;



THE BRIDE
I don't know...Because...I'm
a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;



BILL
No. You're not a bad person. You're
a terrific person. You're my
favorite person. But every once in
awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.



INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

TWO SHOT CU
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to
each other, watching T.V.

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right
in the jungle.

CUT TO:



BLACK FRAME
TITLE APPEARS:

1.

EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
French call cow country).
We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

CHAPTER ONE

"ONCE UPON A TIME IN...

NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

"1941
One year into the German
occupation of France".
The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
year, or just started today.

JULIE
One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

JULIE'S POV:
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

JULIE
Pappa.
The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
and see's the Germans approaching.
The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
approaching.
The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.









IL

FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump
to wash up with, then get inside with
your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
splashing into the basin.
The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
sill.

JULIE
Ready Pappa.

FARMER
Thank you darling, now go inside and
take care of your mother. Don't run.
Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
sill with the water basin...
.The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
Party come to a halt on his property.
We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
the Farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?









3

NAZI DRIVER
Yes heer Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
in his left hand
n d

OFFICER
Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
left alone.

NAZI DRIVER
As you wish Heer Col.
The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
and says in French with a smile on his face;

NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

PERRIER
How may I help you?

COL LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside
your home and we may have a discussion.

INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
inside the Frenchman's home.
Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
in his direction.
The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.









VA

PERRIER
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
French Farmers Wife...

COL LANDA
Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
at your service.
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
hand...

COL LANDA
please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.

FARMERS WIFE
Don't be ridiculous, heer Col.
While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
heard in the village about your family
are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
woman.
His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.

COL.LANDA

(CON' T )
And each of your daughters is more lovely
then the last.

PERRIER
Merci. Please have a seat.
The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
feet.
The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;

PERRIER
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
The Colonel some wine?









COL LANDA
Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
wine. This being a dairy farm one would
be safe in assuming you have milk?

CHARLOTTE
Oui.

COL LANDA
Then milk is what I prefer.

CHARLOTTE
Very Well.
The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
LOUDLY on the wooden table.

COL LANDA
Monsieur, to both your family, and your
cows, I say; Bravo.

PERRIER
Merci.

COL LANDA
Please, join me at your
table.

PERRIER
Very well.
The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
The Nazi.
The Women remain standing.
Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of

CONFIDENTIALLY;

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
discuss,' would be better discussed in
private. You'll notice, I left my men
outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
could you ask your lovely ladies to step
outside.

PERRIER
You are right.









G.

PERRIER
(to his women)
Charlotte, would you take the girls
outside. The Colonel and I need to have
a few words.
The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
humble home.

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
you I've exhausted the extent of my
French. To continue to speak it so
inadequately, would only serve to
embarrass me. However, I've been lead
to believe you speak English quite well?

PERRIER
Oui.

COL LANDA
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house, I ask your
permission to switch to English, for the
remainder of the conversation?

PERRIER
By all means.
They now speak ENGLISH;

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
familiar with you, and your family.
I have no way of knowing if you are
familiar with who I am. Are you aware
of my existence?
The Farmer answers;

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
This is good. Are you aware of the job
I've been ordered to carry out in France?









I

PERRIER
Yes.
The Colonel drinks more milk.

COL LANDA
Please tell me what you've heard?

PERRIER
I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
charge of rounding up the Jews left in
France who are ether hiding, or passing
for Gentile.
The S.S.Colonel smiles.

COL LANDA
The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
himself.

PERRIER
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine
months ago for hiding Jews, and found
nothing.

COL LANDA
I'm aware of that, I read the report on
this area. But like any enterprise,
when under new management, there's
always a slight duplication of efforts.
Most of it being a complete waste of time,
but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have A few questions Monsieur
LaPadite, if you can assist me with
answers, my department can close the
file on your family.
Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
referring to it;

COL LANDA
Now before the occupation there were
four Jewish families in this area, all
dairy farmers like yourself.
The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?









8,

PERRIER
To my knowledge those were the Jewish
families among the dairy farmers.
- Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe?
Looking up from his papers.

COL LANDA
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
house, make yourself comfortable.
The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
guest.
As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
studies the papers in front of him.

COL LANDA
Now according to these papers, all
the Jewish families in this area have
been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear
they have vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've ether made good their escape,
or someone is very successfully hiding
them.
(looking up from
his papers, across
the table at The

FARMER)
What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
Monsieur LaPadite?

PERRIER
Only rumors -

COL LANDA
- I love rumors! Facts can be so
misleading, where rumors, true or false
are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
what rumors have you heard regarding
The Dreyfusis?
The Farmerlooks at Landa.









I.

COL LANDA
Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
to hear what the rumors are, not who told
them to you.
The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.

PERRIER
Again, this is just a rumor - but we
heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
into Spain.

COL LANDA
So the rumors you've heard have been of
escape?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
friendly?
As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
floorboards revealing;

FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
exterminate them.

PERRIER
We were families in the same community,
in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
we were friends, but members of the same
community, we had common interest.
The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
to the next question.

COL LANDA
Having never met the Dreyfusis, would
you confirm for me the exact members of
the household and their names?









10.

PERRIER
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
her brother, Bob ...

COL LANDA
- How old is Bob?

PERRIER
Thirty - thirty one?

COL LANDA
Continue.

PERRIER
And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.

COL LANDA
Ages of the children?

PERRIER
Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
sure.

CUT TO

UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY
The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the
clothes line.
They can't hear anything going on inside.
e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.

SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

COL LANDA
Well I guess that should do it.
Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
ttache case.
the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

COL LANDA
However, before I go, could I have another
glass of your delicious milk?








it.

PERRIER
But of course.
Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
German Officer talks.

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given
me?

PERRIER
I have no interest in such things.

COL LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me?

PERRIER
I'm aware.

COL LANDA
What are you aware of?

PERRIER
That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".

COL LANDA
Precisely! Now I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good
people of Prague bestowed on him.
Actually why he would hate the name,
"The Hangman", is baffling to me
It would appear he did everything in
his power to earn it. But I, on the
other hand, love my unofficial title,
precisely because I've earned it.
As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
with the french farmer.

COL LANDA
The feature that makes me such a effective
hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
where they can only think like a German,
or more precisely, a German soldier.
Now if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast, it
would be the cunning and predatory instinct
of a hawk.









COL LANDA

(CON'T)
Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
smell - physical strength - penis size.
But, if one were to determine what attributes
the jews share with a beast, it would be
that of the rat.
Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.
Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
consider the comparison a insult.
Consider for a moment, the world a rat
lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your
front door right now, would you greet it
with hostility?

PERRIER
I suppose I would.

COL LANDA
Has a rat ever done anything to you to
create this animosity you feel toward
them?

PERRIER
Rat's spread disease, they bite people -

COL LANDA
- Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don't
make it a practise of biting human beings.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
but that was some time ago. In all your
born days, has a rat ever caused you to
be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
you, any disease a rat could spread,
a squirrel could equally carry.
Yet I assume you don't share the same
animosity with squirrels that you do with
rats, do you?

PERRIER
No.

COL LANDA
Yet, they are both rodent's, are they
not? And except for the fact that one
has a big bushy tail, while the other
has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
they even rather look alike, don't they?









13.6

PERRIER
It is a interesting thought,
beer Colonel.

COL LANDA
However, interesting as the thought may
be, it makes not one bit of difference
to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
through your door, this very minute,
would you offer it a saucer of your
delicious milk?

PERRIER
Probably not.

COL LANDA
I didn't think so. You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like
them. All you know is, you find them
repulsive.
(let's the

What a tremendously hostile world a rat
must endure. Yet, not only does he
survive, he thrives. And the reason for
this, is because our little foe has a
instinct for survival and presavation
second to none. And that Monsieur, is
what a jew shares with a rat.
Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding
jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
in the barn, he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar - he looks
everywhere, he would hide. But there are
many places it would never occur to a
hawk to hide. However the reason the
Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
and placed me in French cow country today,
is because it does occur to me. Because
I'm aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon
dignity.

A the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he

COL LANDA
The other mistake the German soldier
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to
the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
of the state. They are simply confused
people, trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates.
These citizens do not need punishing.
They simply need to be reminded of their
duty in war time.
Let's use you as a example Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself,
your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
here you are.
So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
a question. In this time of war, what is
your number one duty? Is it to fight the
Germans in the name of France to your
last breath? Or, is it to harass the
occupying army to the best of your
ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
unfortunate victims of warfare who can
not protect themselfs?
Or, is your number one duty in this time
of bloodshed, to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family?
The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

COL LANDA
That was a question Monsieur LaPadite.
In this time of war, What do you consider
your number one duty?

PERRIER
To protect my family.

COL LANDA
Now, my job dictates, that I must have
my men enter your home, and conduct a
thorough search, before I can officially
cross your families name off my list.









COL LANDA

(CON'T)
And if there are any irregularities to be
found, rest assured, they will be.
That is unless, you have something to tell
me that will make the conducting of a
search unnecessary.

(PAUSE)
I might add also, that any information
that makes the preforming of My duty
easier, will not be met with punishment.
Actually quite the contrary, it will be
met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family
will cease to be harassed in anyway,
by the German military during the rest
of our occupation of your country.
The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
opponent.

COL LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state,
are you not?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
Your sheltering them underneath your
floorboards aren't you?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
Point out to me the area's where their
hiding.
The Farmer points out the area's on the floor with the Dreyfusis are

COL LANDA
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume that while their listening,
they don't speak english?

PERRIER
Yes .

COL LANDA

no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed
the massacre of her entire family.
She may not survive the night. And after
word spreads about what happened today,
it's highly unlikely she will find any
willing farmers to extend her aid.
If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
probably be turned in by some neighbour.
Or, she'll be spotted by some German
soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the
woods, dead from starvation or exposure.
Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will
elude capture. She will escape to America.
She will move to New York city.
Where she will be elected, President of

HITLER
How much more of these jew swine

Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

HITLER
No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
the rumors myself! Solders of The Third
Reich, who have brought the world to
there knee`s, now pecking and clucking
like chickens. Do you know the latest
rumor they've conjured up, in their fear
induced delirium? The one that beats
my boys with a bat. The one they call
"The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
A avenging jew angel, conjured up by
a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

GENERAL
Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers

His head lies on the ground horizontal. A HAND reaches into
FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriots helmet, and
grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair. A LARGE KNIFE
ENTERS FRAME, and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
This process is called SCALPING.
After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off like a
banana.

GERMAN PRISONERS PVT.BUTZ AND SGT.RACHTMAN

Private Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED into

PFC.HIRSCHBERG
You! Go!
Sgt.Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
in the ass, sending him on his way.
Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
Aldo in the middle.
As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt.Butz) speaks over
the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;

NARRATOR(VO)
Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he's ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange.
It's always been his belief, only a
weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
complies with the enemy under threat
of consequence.
As Werner watched men cry like women,
pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
exchange for their worthless lives,
he made a vow to himself.
If his role is to die in this conflict.
When they put him under the earth, his
dignity would be buried with him.
For in the other world, the gods only
respect the ones they test first.
Well Sgt, this is your test.
And the gods are watching.
The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
salutes his captor.

Aldo returns the salute, looking up at him.

LT.ALDO
Wicki there, a Austrian Jew, got the
fuck outta Saltzberg, while the
gettin was good. Became American,
got drafted, and came back to give

Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big scary looking
Basterd, in a German Sgt's uniform, named, SGT.HUGO STIGLITZ

LT.ALDO
And another one over there, you
might be familiar with, Sgt.Hugo
Stiglitz. Heard of 'em.
The two German Sgt's look at each other.

SGT.RACHTMAN
Everybody in the German army's heard
of Hugo Stiglitz.
The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back.
The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

NARRATOR(VO)
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's
celebrity among German soldiers
is simple.
WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

NARRATOR(VO)
As a German enlisted man, he killed
thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly
Majors.

Nazi's, I think you show great talent,
and I pride myself on havin a eye for
that kind of talent. But your status

I thought we were having tea together?

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
And in this pursuit, how is it that I
can be of service?

DONNY
I'm going through the neighbourhood.
If you have any love ones in Europe,
who's safety you fear for, I'd like
you to write their name on my bat.

BACK TO BASTERDS
Donny takes a long walk to Werner...
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER
WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK and FORTE BETWEEN DONNY and

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN...

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
You must be a real BASTERD, Donny?









DONNY
You bet your sweet ass I am.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
Good. A Basterds work is never done.
Specially in Germany.
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi;

DONNY
Gimmie your papers.
Werner hands Donny up his papers.
Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
pocket.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
Hand me your sword Gideon. I do believe
I will join you on this journey.

INSERT
she signs the BAT, "MADELEINE"

BACK TO BASTERDS
Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
The Basterds.

PVT.BUTZ
watches. Hirschberg says to him;

PFC.HIRSCHBERG
About now, I'd be shittin my pants, if
I was you.
Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him.

PFC.HIRSCHBERG
That means you, cup cake.
A crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.

LT.ALDO
You wanna live?

PVT.BUTZ
Yes, sir.

LT.ALDO
Point out on this map, the German
position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the
positions.








3 s.

PVT.BUTZ
This area here.

LT.ALDO
How many?

PVT.BUTZ
Maybe twelve.

LT.ALDO
What kinda of artillery?

PVT.BUTZ
They have a machine gunn dug in here
pointing north.

HITLER
How did you survived this ordel?
WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The
Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

PRVT.BUTZ
They let me go.

FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

LT.ALDO
Now when you report what happened here,
you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you
told us. They'll shoot ya. But there gonna
wanna know, why you so special, we let you
live? So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you
could spread the word through the ranks,
what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

HITLER
You are not to tell anybody anything!
Not one word of detail! Your outfit
was ambushed, and you got a away.
Not one word more.

PVT.BUTZ
Yes mine Fuhrer.

HITLER
Did they mark you like they did the
other survivors?









36Ã¢Â‚¬Â¢

PVT.BUTZ
Yes mine Fuhrer.

HITLER
Remove your hat and show me.

LT.ALDO
Now say we let ya go, and say you
survive the'war? When you get back
home, what'eha gonna do?

PVT.BUTZ
I will hug my mother like I've never
hugged her before.

LT.ALDO
Well, ain't that's a real nice boy. Are you
going to take off your uniform?

PVT.BUTZ
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend
to burn it!
The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

LT. ALDO
Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't
like that. You see, we like our Nazi's
in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em,
just like that.
(Snaps his fingers)
But you take off that uniform, ain't
nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

LT.ALDO
So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin,
you can't take off.

BACK TO HITLER
Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face,
his moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND

CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

BACK TO BASTERDS

BUTZ'S POV:
on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
swastika, and he's holding the bloody knife. All The
Basterds crowd around to admire his handy work.









37.

SGT.DONOWITZ
You know Lieutenant, your getting pretty
good at that.

LT. ALDO
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall,
don't 'ch? Practice.

FADE TO BLACK

OVER BLACK

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER THREE

"GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"
NOTE: This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave
Black and White.

INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the
CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the
screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from
the little glass window in the back of the theatre
The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and
Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens
of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark
We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced
German omm paw paw musical movie being projected.
The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the
German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium...

TILL...
.The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the
movie.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

"1941

PARIS

TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"
We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
The lights go up in the auditorium.
Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
their coats, and file out.









3P.

EXT - LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)- NIGHT
Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French:
"GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

INT - AUDITORIUM

CU SHOSANNA
still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
empty.
The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
the empty cinema.
The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

ENGLISH.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
we're closed for the evening. I must assume
you want something. What can I do for you?

SHOSANNA
May I sleep here tonight?

MADAME MIMIEUX
So I gather your not a nurse?

SHOSANNA
No.

MADAME MIMIEUX
But your a bright little thing, that's
clever disguise. Where is your family?

SHOSANNA
Murdered.









3 1.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So your a war orphan?

SHOSANNA
We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us

MADAME MIMIEUX
Is this a sad story?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Sad stories bore me. These days everyone
in Paris has one. I haven't bore you
with mine, don't bore me with yours.

SHOSANNA
You can run the machines?

MADAME MIMIEUX
What machines?
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
projector, she says;

SHOSANNA
The machines that show the film?

MADAME MIMIEUX
The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
of course I can operate them.

SHOSANNA
I know, I saw you.

FLASH ON:

CU SHOSANNA
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
watching...

MADAME MIMIEUX
expertly working the projectors...

BACK TO SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA
Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,
that show the film. It's only you and
the negro. I know you could use some help.









40.

MADAME MIMIEUX
I know at least six people who've been
put up against a wall, and machine
gunned for sheltering enemies of the
state. I have no intention of being
unlucky number seven. How long have
you been in Paris?

SHOSANNA
A week, and a few days.

MADAME MIMIEUX
How have you survived the curfew
without capture?

SHOSANNA
I sleep on rooftops.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?

SHOSANNA
Cold.

MADAME MIMIEUX

(LAUGHS)
I can imagine.

SHOSANNA
Respectfully, no you can't.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Fair enough.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So you can't operate a 35mm film projector,
you want me teach you, in order to work
here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole
to hide in, is that correct?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Whats your name?

SHOSANNA
Shosanna.









MADAME MIMIEUX
I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
home for wayward war orphans.
Having said that, what you say is true.
If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So Shosanna, are you
truly exceptional?

SHOSANNA
Oui Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
I will be the judge of that.

DISSOLVE TO

TITLE CARD:
Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
complete with Eiffel Tower.

ABOVE IT READS:

"1944

PARIS"

THEN...
The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE
CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little
Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
Month is JUNE.
..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working
as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed
Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this
will be "Shosanna's Theme".
A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

SILVER SCREEN
of the little cinema. On Screen LENI REFENSHTAL lies
horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old
German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu",
The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper right
hand corner of the FRAME...(That tells the projectionist
to get ready).








As the FILM REEL on the lst PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna
stands ready, waiting by the 2nd PROJECTOR...

WHEN...

SILVER SCREEN
the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place(That's the
one).

SHOSANNA
THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from
projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva
MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans
up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect...

EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
The MARQUEE READS in French:
"GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;

NARRATOR(VO)
To operate a cinema in Paris during
the occupation, one had two choices.
Ether you could show new German propaganda
films, produced under the watchful
eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
could have a German night in your
weekly schedule, and show allowed
German classic films.
Their German night was Thursday.
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
the letters on the marquee.
A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
girl on top, and walks over.
They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

GERMAN SOLDIER
What starts tomorrow?
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up
at her from below.









LC 3.

SHOSANNA
A Max Linder festival.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
film as good as "The Rid". The chase
climax of "The Kid", superb.
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

GERMAN SOLDIER
I suppose now you could use a "M"
a "A" and a "X"?

SHOSANNA
No need, I can manage.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure.
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

SHOSANNA
Merci.

GERMAN SOLDIER
I adore your cinema very much.

SHOSANNA
Merci.
She busies herself with the marquee letters...

GERMAN SOLDIER

SHOSANNA

GERMAN SOLDIER

SHOSANNA

GERMAN SOLDIER
How does a young girl, such as yourself,
own a cinema?
Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts
at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in
hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.









SHOSANNA
My aunt left it to me.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Lucky girl.
Shosanna makes no reply back.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Merci for hoisting a German night.

SHOSANNA
I don't have a choice, but your welcome.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Do you chose the German films yourself?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Then my merci stands. I love the
Refensthal mountain films, especially,
"Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French
girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.

SHOSANNA
"Admire", would not be the adjective
I would use to describe my feelings
towards Fraulein Refensthal.

GERMAN SOLDIER
But you do admire the director. Pabst,
don't you? That's why you included
his name on the marquee.
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
Private.

SHOSANNA
I'm French. We respect directors
in our country.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Apparently even Germans.

SHOSANNA
Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
Private. Adieu.
She turns to go back inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Your not finished?









SHOSANNA
I'll finish in the morning.
She opens the door to go inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER
May I ask your name?

SHOSANNA
You wish to see my papers?
She hands him her excellently forged papers.
That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
to read her name.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
pretty name.

SHOSANNA
Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
He hands them back.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller.
She gives no response.

GERMAN SOLDIER
It's been a pleasure chatting with a
fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams,
Mademoiselle.
He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
curfew imposed night.
She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to
her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate
anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

EXT - ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT
Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
she remembers a voice.

FLASH ON
MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.








If-7.

MADAME MIMIEUX
if I ever see you light up a cigarette
in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
the Nazi's, do you understand?
Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
And for bringing a open flame in my
cinema, you deserve far worse then
a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
head, what do you think the highest
priority of a cinema manager is?
Keeping this fucking place from burning
down to the ground, that's what!
In my collection, I have over 350,
35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
not only immensely flammable, but
highly unstable. And should they
catch fire, they burn three times
faster then paper. If that happens..
.POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
every body burned alive. If I ever
see you with a open flame in my cinema
again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
Germans will give me a curfew pass.
Do you understand me?

SHOSANNA
Out, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me?

SHOSANNA
Out, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better.

BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.

MARCEL
Are you well?









SHOSANNA
Even on the roof I can't smoke a
cigarette without hearing Madames
voice yelling at me. That's why I
do it. To hear Madames voice again.

MARCEL
We both miss her.

SHOSANNA
I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
to bed soon.
Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.

INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOON
Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

FREDRICK
May I join you?

SHOSANNA
Look Fredrick -

FREDRICK

(SMILING)
- You remember my name?

SHOSANNA
Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
enough fellow -

FREDRICK
- Merci.

SHOSANNA
Your welcome. - regardless, I want
you to stop pestering me.

FREDRICK
I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
trying to be a pest. I was simply
trying to be friendly.

SHOSANNA
I don't wish to be your friend.









FREDRICK
Why not?

SHOSANNA
Don't act like a infant. You know why.

FREDRICK
I'm more then just a uniform.

SHOSANNA
Not to me. If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
Vichy?
Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
go on their way.
Shosanna's eyes narrow.

SHOSANNA
Who are you?

FREDRICK
I thought I was just a uniform?

SHOSANNA
Your not just a German soldier, are
you somebodies son?

FREDRICK
Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

SHOSANNA
Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
are you, Hitlers nephew?
He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

FREDRICK
Yes.

SHOSANNA
Really?

FREDRICK
No not really, I'm just teasing you.
She leans back annoyed.

SHOSANNA
Then what is it? What are you, a German
movie star?









6'O

FREDRICK
Not exactly.

SHOSANNA
(Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
I asked if you were a movie star, the
answer to that question, is yes or no.
Fredrick laughs at that line.

FREDRICR
When you said that just now, you
reminded me of my sister.
This catches young Shosanna off guard.

FREDRICR
I come from a home of six sisters.
We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
Seeing you run around your cinema,
reminds me of them. Especially my sister
Helga. She raised me, when our father
wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
German uniform.

SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga?

FREDRICK
All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
was the bossiest.

SHOSANNA
And your mother and father?

FREDRICK
My mother died. And my father was a
loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
you don't succeed, quit". The day he
left, good riddance. My sisters are
all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
It makes me feel both closer to them,
and a little homesick at the same time.

SHOSANNA
is your cinema still operatiing?

FREDRICR
Oui.

SHOSANNA
What's it called?









5!

FREDRICK
The Kino Haus.

SHOSANNA
How has it done durring the war?

FREDRICK
Actually, in Germany, cinema
attendance is up.

SHOSANNA
No doubt, you don't have to operate
under a curfew.

FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house?

SHOSANNA
(Pfuit), not since before the war.

FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement, that
would help you out?

SHOSANNA
Of course, but that's not likely to
happen.
TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

SHOSANNA
So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

FREDRICK
Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

SHOSANNA
What did you do?
He takes a sip of beer.

FREDRICK
I've shot the most enemy soldiers
in world war two...so far.
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

SHOSANNA
Wow.









52

FREDRICK
I was alone in a bell tower in a
walled off city in Russia. It was
myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
in a bird's nest, against three
hundred Soviet soldiers.

SHOSANNA
What's a bird's nest?

FREDRICK
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
a bell tower. It's a high structure,
offering a three hundred and sixty degree
view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

SHOSANNA
How many Russian's did you kill?

FREDRICK
Sixty-eight.

(BEAT)
The first day. A hundred and fifty the
second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
On the forth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received alot of
attention in Germany, that's why they
all recognize me. They call me the
German Sgt.York.

SHOSANNA
Maybe they'll make a film about
your exploits.

FREDRICK
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
play myself, so I did. They have posters
for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
another reason for all the attention.

SHOSANNA
"Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
Pride" is starring you?

FREDRICK
I know, comical, huh?

SHOSANNA
Not so comical. So what are you doing
in Paris, enjoying a rest?









53.

FREDRICK
Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
having my picture taken with different
German luminaries, visiting troops,
that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
film to premier in Paris, so I've been
helping them in the planning.
Joseph is very keen on this film.
He's telling anybody who will listen,
when "Nation's Pride" is released,
I'll be the German Van Johnson.
Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
She abruptly rises, and says;

SHOSANNA
Well, good luck with your premier
Private. I hope all goes well for
Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
alone.

EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
It's the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
$hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
ladder.

WHEN...
.A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
of the sedan.
The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.








5 q.

GESTAPO MAJOR
Mademoiselle Nimieux?

SHOSANNA
Oui?
Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

GESTAPO MAJOR
Ask her if this is her cinema?
in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

DRIVER
is this your cinema?

SHOSANNA

GESTAPO MAJOR
Tell her to come down.

DRIVER
Come down please.
She climbs down the ladder.
The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
to get in.

SHOSANNA
I don't understand, what have I done?

DRIVER
(to Major)
She wants to know what she's done?

GESTAPO MAJOR
Who says she's done anything?

DRIVER
Who says you've done anything?
Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

SHOSANNA
Then I demand to know what this is about,
and where do you propose to take me?
The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
French girl and tells her in German;









55.

GESTAPO MAJOR
Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY
The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
streets.

WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
The sedan stops.
The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
(and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
table.
We join them in mid-conversation;
They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

GOEBBELS
- it's only the off spring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically.
America olympic gold can measured in Negro
sweat.
Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
and greets her before she reaches the table.
Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

FREDRICK
Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or
not you'd except my invitation.









SHOSANNA
Invitation?

THEN...
.Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;

GOEBBLES(OS)
Is that the young lady in question,
Fredrick?
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
arm, and leads her to him.

FREDRICK
Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
there is somebody I want you to meet.
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
minister formally.

FREDRICK
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to
introduce you to the minister of
propaganda, the leader of the entire
German film industry, and now I'm a
actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
shake. She does.

GOEBBELS
Your reputation precedes you Fraulein
Mimieux.
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big
bite of terri misu.
They all laugh.
Fredrick jumps in...

FREDRICK
And normally, this is beer Goebbels French
interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca
Mondino.

FRANCESCA
looks up at Shosanna.









5'?
NARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack;

NARRATOR (VO)
Francesca Mondino is much more then
Goebbels French Interpreter.
She's also Goebbels favorite French
actress to appear in his films...

FLASH ON:

FILM CLIP
from one of Francesca's B/W Goebbels produced productions.
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG

GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in to ENGLISH;

FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
I love you, I can't help it. My country
or my heart, which do I betray?
A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the films title;

"SENTIMENTAL COMBAT" (1943)

FLASH ON
Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red
velvet bed.

NARRATOR (VO)
And Goebbels favorite French Mistress,
to act in his bed.
WE SEE JUST A SUPER QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca

DOGGY STYLE.

FRANCESCA

(ANIMAL-LIKE)
Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!

BACK TO FRANCESCA
looking at Shosanna.

FRANCESCA
Bon jour.

SHOSANNA
Bon jour.









I
f.

FREDRICK
And you've met the Major.
The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;

GESTAPO MAJOR
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
(to Shosanna)
Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at
your service mademoiselle.
(he clicks
his heels)
Please allow me, have a seat.
The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
from a small craft on the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
Goebbels looks across the table at her.

GOEBBELS
well I must say, you've made quite a
impression on our boy.
Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.

GOEBBELS
I must say fraulein, I should be rather
annoyed with you.
Francesca interprets..

GOEBBELS
I arrive in France, and I wish to have
lunch with my star...
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
Little do I know Be's become
the toast of paris, and now he
must find time for me.
Francesca interprets...








c9 Ã¢â‚¬Â¢

GOEBBELS
People wait in line hours, day's,
to see me. For the Fuhrer and
Private Zoller, I wait.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
So finally, I'm granted a audience
with the young Private, and he spends
the entire lunch speaking of you
and your cinema.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
to business.
Private Zoller interrupts -

FREDRICK
- Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed
her yet.

GOEBBELS
Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm
sure she's figured it out by now,
after all she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
Francesca tells Shosanna in French;

FRANCESCA
What they're trying to tell you
Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch,
trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private
Zollers film premier, and change the
venue to your cinema.
Zoller reacts.

FRANCESCA

(FRENCH
to Zoller)
What?

FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her.

FRANCESCA
Shit. I apologize Private, of
course you did.









60.

GOEBBELS

(GERMAN
to Francesca)
What's the issue?

FRANCESCA
The Private wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.

GOEBBELS
Nonsense. Until I ask a few
questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not
agreed to a venue change.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted.
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;

GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes?

SHOSANNA

GOEBBELS

SHOSANNA

GOEBBELS
More would be better. How many
seats in your auditorium?

SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty.

GOEBBELS
That's almost four hundred less
then The Ritz.
Fredrick jumps in...

FREDRICK
But beer Goebbels, that's not such
a terrible thing. You said yourself
you didn't want to indulge every
two faced french bourgeois taking
up space currying favor. With less
seat's it makes the event more
exclusive. Your not trying to fill
the house, their fightin g for seats.









61.

FREDRICK

(CON'T)
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German
event, a German celebration. This
night is for you, me, the German
military, the high command, their
family and friends. The only people
who should be allowed in the room,
are people who will be moved by
the exploits on screen.
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;

GOEBBELS
I see your public speaking has
improved. It appears I've created
a monster. A strangely persuasive
monster. When the war's over,
politics awaits.
Table chuckles.

GOEBBELS
Well Private, though it is true,
I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
I must watch a film in this young
ladies cinema before I can say,
yes or no.
(to Shosanna)
So young lady, you are to close
your cinema tonight, and have
a private screening me.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
What German films do you have?
Francesca asks..

SHOSANNA
My cinema , on German night, tends
to show older German classics.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
Why not my films?
Francesca asks...









6Z.

SHOSANNA
I draw a older German audience in
my cinema, that appreciate the
nostalgia of the earlier time.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
are looking forward, not backwards.
That era of German cinema is dead.
The German cinema I create, will not
only be thee cinema of Europe. But
the worlds only alternative to the
degenerate Jewish influence of
Hollywood.
Fredrick Jumps in...

FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner,
Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
film critic.
He chuckles, but alone.

GOEBBELS
WSo it would appear. Unfortunately
for the fraulein, I've outlawed
film criticism.
Zoller, thinking fast, says;

FREDRICK
Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
And it's so funny, I've been meaning
to recommend it to her, for her
German night. That's a great idea,
let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.

GOEBBELS
Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids",
"Lucky Kids". When all is said and
done, my most purely enjoyable
production. Not only that, I
wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"
that I'm the most remembered for.
I know it doesn't seem like it now,
but mark my words.
Very well, I'll have a print sent
over to the fraulein'.s cinema.
We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.









63
As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna...
...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.

GOEBBELS
Ah Landa, your here, this is the
young lady in question.
The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
first scene COL HANS LANDA.

FREDRICK
Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of
the SS., he'll be running security
for the premier.

CU SHOSANNA
A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
The S.S. OFFICER
that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
saying in perfect French;

COL LANDA
Charmed Mademoiselle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as "The Jew Hunter".
The table laughs.

GOEBBELS
Oh Francesca, what was that funny
thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?

FRANCESCA
What thing?

GOEBBELS
You know, you were there, it was a
funny thing the Fuhrer said,
about Hans...Something about a pig?
Francesca's memory is jogged.

FRANCESCA
Oh, yes of course.
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.









6 "F

GOEBBELS
Oh, yes of course, that's it. So
the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be
surprised if Hans weren't rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the play pen.

FRANCESCA
That's what we need, pigs that can
root out Jews.

COL LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me?
Big hearty laugh around the table.

GOEBBELS
Do you have a engagement tonight?

COL LANDA
Well, as a matter of fact, I do -

GOEBBELS
- Break it. We're all going to the
Fraulein's cinema tonight to view
"Lucky Kids".

COL LANDA
Splendid.
Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,

INTERRUPTS;

FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
to his next appointment.

GOEBBELS
Slave driver! French slave driver!
They all chuckle.
Everybody begins to stand up from the table...
..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs...
.as Col Landa stands, he says;

COL LANDA
Actually, in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion,
I'm afraid I must have a word with
Mademoiselle Mimieux.









C. 5.
Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

FREDRICK
What sort of discussion?

COL LANDA
That sounded suspiciously like a
Private questioning the order of a
Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

FREDRICK
Nothing could be further from the
truth Colonel. Your authority is
beyond question.
But your reputation does proceed
you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?

GOEBBELS
Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
simply smitten. And he's correct.
Your reputation does proceed you.
Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
a leash, leading the way.

COL LANDA
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venue's property owner.

FREDRICK
I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema.

GOEBBELS
Nonsense! You can eat ice cream,
and walk along the Sienne another
time. Right now, allow Col Landa
to do his job.
Everybody saystheir farewells.
Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at
french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was
simply a interrogation-technique.








bd.
They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

COL LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here?

SHOSANNA
No.

COL LANDA
It's not so terrible. So how is it
the young Private and yourself came
to be acquainted?
She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.

COL LANDA
Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
of espresso, with a container of.
steamed milk, on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time
she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
least... . disconcerting.
The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
your secrets.

COL LANDA
So Mademoiselle, you were beginning
to explain....?

SHOSANNA

(ANXIOUSLY)
Up untill a couple of days ago,
I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,
or his exploits. To me, the Private
was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times, but -

COL LANDA
- Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality, no
reason for you to feel anxious.
The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;









67

COL LANDA
I apologize, I forgot to order the
cream fresh.

WAITER
One moment.
He exits.

COL LANDA
(Refuring to
the apple pie)
Wait for the cream.
(Back to

BUSINESS)
So Emmanuelle - May I call you
Emmanuelle?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

COL LANDA
So Emmanuelle, explain to me how
does it happen, that a young lady
such as your self, comes to own a
cinema?
The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
up his fork, he says;

COL LANDA
After you.
Shosanna takes Ã¢â‚¬Â¢a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her
lead.

COL LANDA

(MOUTHFULL
of pie)
Success?
Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves.

.COL LANDA
Like I said, not so terrible.
(Back to

BUSINESS)
So you were explaining the origin of
your cinema ownership?









69.

SHOSANNA
The cinema originally belonged to
my aunt and uncle -
Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.

COL LANDA
- What is there names?

SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
He records the names in his little book.

COL LANDA
Where are they now?

SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.

COL LANDA
Pity... . Continue.

SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring.'

COL LANDA
Regrettable.

(RESPECTFUL

PAUSE)
It's come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ, is that true?

SHOSANNA
Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is
Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works
with me.

COL LANDA
Doing what?

SHOSANNA
Projectionist.

COL LANDA
Is he any good?

SHOSANNA
The best.









61.

COL LANDA
Actually one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?

SHOSANNA
Of course I can.

COL LANDA
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
the success or failure of his
illustrious evening, dependent on
the prowess of a negro. So if it
comes to pass we hold this event
at your venue, talented no doubt,
as your negro may be, you will
operate the projectors. Is that
exceptable?
As if she has any say.

SHOSANNA
Oui.
Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.

COL LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is
quite smitten with you?

SHOSANNA
Private Zollers feelings for me
aren't of a romantic nature.

COL LANDA
Mademoiselle...?

SHOSANNA
Colonel, his feelings are not
romantic. I remind him of his sister.

COL LANDA
That doesn't mean his feelings
aren't romantic.

SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him.









70

COL LANDA
It's sounding more and more romantic
by the minute.
Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

COL LANDA
Cigarette?

SHOSANNA
No thank you.

COL LANDA
Do you smoke?

SHOSANNA
Yes.

COL LANDA
Then I insist, you must take one.
There not French, there German.
I hope your not nationalist about
your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
are a sin against nicotine.
She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
He inhales deep, and says;

COL LANDA
I did have some thing else I wanted
to ask you, but right now, for the
life of me, I can't remember what it
is. Oh well, must not of been important.
Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
saluting Shosanna, and saying:

COL LANDA
Till tonight.
And with that he's gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
During her conversation and strudel with the man that
exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
feet.









7 1.

INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
The SILVER SCREEN
on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".
We hear OFF SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics.

CU GOEBBELS
Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

CU FRANCESCA
Laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

CU TWO BLACK POODLES
Pantingly watching the screen.

CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
Smiling, smoking a French cigarette.

CU COL LANDA
Smoking his calabash, amused.

CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
Truly enjoying himself.

CU SHOSANNA
watching the screen.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

NARRATOR (VO)
While Shosanna sits there pretending
to be amused by the aryan antics of
Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
her.
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

NARRATOR (VO)
What if tonight, accidently, the
cinema burned down? The Third Reich
would lose it's Minister of
propaganda, it's national hero, and
it's top jew hunter, all in one fell
swoop.
She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
laughing at the German comedy.

SILVER SCREEN
"The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.









IZ
The lights go up.

P
Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
file out into the lobby.

NARRATOR(VO)
The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
complete success. And Heer Goebbels
conceded to have the venue changed
to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
in a moment of inspiration, Heer
Goebbels had a idea.
Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

GOEBBELS
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium. Your Cinema
has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the
place up a bit. In Versailles
there's a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary. we're going to get it,
and hang it from the very middle of
auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
and just scatter them about the lobby.

MONTAGE
we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
A truck driving through the french countryside with the
enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
into place.
We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

SHOSANNA
watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in
disbelief.









73

BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI "S
in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes.

NARRATOR (VO)
As they left the little French
cinema that night, all the Germans
were very happy...
We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he.can say goodbye.

NARRATOR (VO)
None more so then Private Zoller.
She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the
Paris night. Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look
like grotesque Nazi charcthers. 4644
The Nazi's are gone.
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
down at Shosanna.
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

MARCEL
What the fuck are we suppose to do?

SHOSANNA
It looks like we're suppose to have
a Nazi premier.

MARCEL
Like I said, what the fuck are we
suppose to do?

SHOSANNA
Well, I need to speak with you
about that.

MARCEL
About what?

SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine, commandeering
our cinema.

MARCEL
What about it?
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.









SHOSANNA
Well, when I was watching the bosch
(Said in

ENGLISH)
Capra-corn abomination,
(Back to

FRENCH)
I got a idea.

MARCEL
I'm confused, what are we talking
about?

SHOSANNA
Filling the cinema with Nazi's and
their whores, and burning it down
to the ground.

MARCEL
I'm not talking about that, your
talking about that.

SHOSANNA
No, we're talking about that,
right now. If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves, we can burn it down
by ourselves.

MARCEL
Shosanna -

SHOSANNA
No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
for any number of reasons, you and I
could physically accomplish that, no?

MARCEL
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

SHOSANNA
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
film print collection, we wouldn't
even need explosives, would we?

MARCEL
You mean we wouldn't need any more
explosives?

SHOSANNA
Oui, that's exactly what I mean.
She begins kissing his hands.









75.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.
One of his fingers probes her mouth.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
And if I'm going to burn down the
cinema, which I am, we both know,
your not going to let me do it
by myself.
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand
both caresses, and grips her lovely neck.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
Because you love me. And I love you.
And your the only person on this earth
I can trust.
She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now,
face to face.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment it the
attic still work? I know the film
camera does. How about the sound
recorder?

MARCEL
Quite well, actually. I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a cafe last
week. It works superb. Why do we
need filmmaking equipment?

SHOSANNA
Because Marcel, my sweet, we're
going to make a film. Just for the
Nazi's.

FADE TO BLACK









?G.

FADE OFF

INT - ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY
A young MILITARY ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors
that serve as a entrance to the room.

MILITARY ATTACHE
Right this way, Lieutenant.
A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of
Bel Ami, years).
Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
Dammed).
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable
bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.

LT. HICOX
Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.

GEN FENECH
(Salutes back)
General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox.
Drink?
Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind
the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no
acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room.
Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't
introduced, he ain't there.

LT.HICOX
if you offered me a scotch and plane
water, I could drink a scotch and
plain water.









?7.

GEN.FENECH
That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself, like a good chap,
will you? Bars in the globe.
Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

LT.HICOX
Something for yourself, sir?

GEN.FENECH
Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and
busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file.

GEN.FENECH
It says here you've run three
undercover commando operations in
Germany, and German occupied
territories? Frankfaurt, Holland,
and Norway to be exact?
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says;

LT.HICOX
Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.

GEN.FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently?

LT.HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

GEN.FENECH
And your occupation before the war?
His back still to us, as he bartends...

LT. H I COX
I'm a film critic.

GEN.FENECH
List your accomplishments?

LT.HICOX
Well sir, such as they are, I write
reviews and articles, for a publication
called; "Films and Filmmakers".
As well as our sister publication.








7f .

GEN.FENECH
What's that called?

LT.HICOX
"Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had
two books published.

GEN.FENECH
Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant,
what are their titles?

LT. HI COX
The first book was called; "Art Of The
Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study
of German Cinema in the Twenties".
And the second one was called; ...
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the
Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
he walks toward the General, handing him his drink.

LT.HICOX
"Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci".
It's a subtexual film criticism
study of the work of German director
G.W. Pabst.

LT. HI COX
What should we drink to, sir?

GEN.FENECH
(Thinking, for
a moment)
Down with Hitler.

LT.HICOX
All the way down, sir.

GEN.FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema
under the Third Reich?

LT. HI COX
Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three
years, but I am familiar with it.

GEN.FENECH
Explain it to me.?









77

LT.HICOX
Pardon sir?

GEN.FENECH
This little escapade of ours,
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

LT.HICOX
Goebbels considers the films he's
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema. A alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the
twenties. And the Jewish controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

CHURCHELL
How's he doing?

LT. H I COX
Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

CHURCHELL
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game? Compared to say
.Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

LT.HICOX
Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
has taken over, film attendance has
steadily risen in Germany over the
last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
closer to David O.Selznick.
Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

CHURCHELL
Brief him.

GEM.FENECH
Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
throwing a gala premier of one of his
new movies in Paris -









80.

LT.HICOX
- What film sir?
The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

GEN.FENECH
The motion pictures called; "Nation's
Pride".

LT.HICOX
Oh, you mean the film about Private
Zoller?

GEN.FENECH
We don't have any intelligence, on
exactly, what the film that night
will be about.

LT.HICOX
But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

GEN.FENECH
Yes.

LT.HICOX
I can tell you what it's about,
it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
He's the German Sgt.York.
Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

GEN.FENECH
In attendance at this joyous Germatic
occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
Boorman, and most of the German High
command, including all high ranking
officers of both The S.S., and, The
Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

LT.HICOX
The master race at play, aye?

GEN.FENECH
Basically, we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket. The objective of
Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.

LT.HICOX
(Reciting a
a poem)
"...and like the snows of yesteryear,
gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.









GEN.FENECH
An American Secret Service outfit,
that lives deep behind enemy lines,
will be your assist. The Germans call
them; "The Basterds".

LT.HICOX
"The Basterds", never heard of them.

GEN.FENECH
Whole point of the secret service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Gerrys have heard of them,
because these yanks have been them
the devil. Their leader is a chap
named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
call him, "Aldo the Apache".

LT.HICOX
Why do they call him that?

GEN.FENECH
Best guess, is because he removes the
scalps of the Nazi dead.

LT.HICOX
Scalps, sir?

GEN.FENECH
The hair.
He runs his finger along his hairline.

GEN.FENECH
Like a red Injun.

LT.HICOX
Rather gruesome sounding little
Dicky bird, isn't he?

GEN.FENECH
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
nutters. But you've heard the
expression, "It takes a thief".

LT.HICOX
Indeed.
General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
to a military map.








9i.

GEN.FENECH
You'll be dropped into France, about
twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you go to a little village
called, "Nadine".
(He points it
out on the map)
Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
"La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
with our double agent, and she'll take
it from there. She's the one who's
going to get you in the premiere.
It will be you, her, and two German
born members of the Basterds. She's
also made all the other arrangements
your going to need.

LT.HICOX
How will I know her?

GEN.FENECH
I suspect that won't be too much
trouble for you. Your contact is
Bridget Von Hammersmark.

LT.HICOX
Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
movie star is working for England?

GEN.FENECH
For the last two years now. one could
even say Operation Kino was her
brainchild.
In the back of the room the bulldog barks;

CHURCHELL
Extraordinary women.

LT.BICOX
Quite.

GEN.FENECH
You'll go to the premiere as her
escort, lucky devil. She'll also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two. Got the gist?

LT.HICOX
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.

EXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY
Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema,
literally, making a movie.
Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
positioned low looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
into it.
A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
SUBTITLED into you know what.

MARCEL
We need a sync mark.

SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark?

MARCEL
A action and noise put together,
So we can sync up the picture
and sound.

SHOSANNA
How do we do that?

MARCEL
Clap your hands.
She does.

MARCEL
In frame imbecile.
She claps her hands in front of her face.

MARCEL
Ready?
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then;

SHOSANNA
Ready.

MARCEL
Action.

WE CUT BEFORE SHE SPEAKS TO...









GIR

.THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
Big diffrence this time, it's in COLOR.

MARCEL
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would
develop that footage. How do we get
a35mm print with a soundtrack?

SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things?

MARCEL
Of course Gaspar, very nice man,
took care of all the experimental
filmmakers. But nobody in their
right mind would strike a print of
what your talking about. If the
Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't
be worth this.
He snaps his fingers.

SHOSANNA
In a wolf fight, you ether eat the
wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're
going to obliterate the Nazi's,
we have to use their tactics.

MARCEL
What does that mean?

SHOSANNA
We find somebody who can develop
and process a35mm print. And we
make them do it, or we kill them.
Once we tell them what we want to
do, if they refuse, we have to kill
them anyway, or they'll turn us in.

MARCEL
Would you do that?

SHOSANNA
Like that.
Snaps her fingers.









?S,

INT - SMALL FILM PROCESSING LAB- LATE NIGHT
A old mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties.
Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE
BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.
Shosanna watches, pitiless.

SHOSANNA
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat
against the table top.
Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
his face.

SHOSANNA
You ether do what the fuck we tell
you to, or I'll bury this axe in your
collaborating skull.

GASPAR
I'm not a collaborator!

SHOSANNA
Then prove it! Or does your manhood
go no deeper, then standing to piss?
Marcel, does his wife, and children
know you?

MARCEL
Oui.

SHOSANNA
Then after we kill this dog for
Germans, we'll go and silence them.
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...

SHOSANNA
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

CUT TO

GASPAR
hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm FILM. Outside
the shop window, it's morning.









INT - PROJECTION BOOTH-
WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers
life story "Nations Pride"(clearly marked) on the floor of
the projection booth.
The can for REEL 4is open and empty.
Shosanna's at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the
rewinds...
Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of
Fredricks film. Rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
puts a piece of RED TAPE on REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

BLACK FRAME

FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT
We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out
front that reads, "La Louisiane".

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
"The Village of

NADINE, FRANCE"
TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a
apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

LT.ALDO
You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous
was in a fuckin basement.

LT.HICOX
I didn't know.

LT.ALDO
You said it was in a tavern?

LT.HICOX
it is a tavern.









LT.ALDO
Yeah, in a basement. You know,
fightin in a basement offers a lot
of difficulties, number one being,
your fighting in a basement.
Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
Lieutenant uniform.

WICKI
What if we go in there, and she's
not even there?

LT.HICOX
We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
chapter, is dead.
Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
.Stiglitz is fucking werid...
Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

LT.NICOX
Stiglitz, right?

STIGLITZ
That's right, sir.
He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
leather strap.

LT.HICOX
I hear your pretty good with that?
Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

LT.HICOX
You know, we're not looking for
trouble, right now. We're simply
making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful. However, on
the off chance I'm wrong, and things
prove eventful. I need to know, we can
all remain calm.









99.
The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
looks up at the limy Lieutenant.

STIGLITZ
I don't look calm to you?

LT.HICOX
Well, now you put it like that,
I guess you do.
He turns his attention back to his blade.
Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

LT. HI COX
This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
Not exactly the loquacious type,
is he?
Aldo just looks at him.

LT.ALDO
Is that the kinds man you need, the
loquacious type?

LT.HICOX
Fair point, Lieutenant.

LT.ALDO
So y'all git in trouble in there,
what are we suppose to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?

LT.HICOX
If we get into trouble, we can
handle it. But if trouble does
happen, we need you to make damn
sure no Germans, or French, for
matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.

SGT.DONOWITZ
Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
who's idea was it for the death trap
redez-vous?

LT.HICOX
She chose the spot.

SGT.DONOWITZ
Well isn't that just dandy?









LT.HICOX
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just a actress.

LT.ALDO
Ya don't got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don't want to
fight in a basement.

LT.HICOX
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place, isolated,
and without germans.

PFC.HIRSCHBERG
Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin on
Louisianna two-o'clock.
They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall.
Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.

LT.HICOX
Shit.
Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

SGT.DONOWITZ
So what do you think your fraulein
Von Hammer -

LT.HICOX
- Obviously, I don't know,Sgt.
The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
in hand.

STIGLITZ
If we're going, let's go.
He sheaths the dagger.

EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task.
Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...







INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT
.Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
five.

FIVE NAZI'S
ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
out who they are.
The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),

FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),

GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5
(WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
of their game playing, and celebrating.

WINNETOU
.okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
The whole table bursts out laughing.

FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN
Yes you arel

EDGAR WALLACE
Well, not really.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.









91

EDGAR WALLACE
Well if he's so American, how come
he's never been translated into
English? He's not American. He's
suppose to be American, but he's not
a American creation. In fact, he's
something very different.

WINNETOU
Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
character, from the past, I'm American,
and that's controversial.

BRIDGET/GENGUS
No it's not controversial. The nationally
of the author, has nothing to do with
the nationally of the character.
The Character is the character.
Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
So yes, this character was born in
America.

WINNETOU
Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
a wife, would she be called a squaw?
He's got it.
The table Laughs.
The TABLE

YES!

WINNETOU
Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
The TABLE
Yes!

WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me?
The TABLE
Yes!
In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark
see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.









QZ

BRIDGET
Hello, my lovelies, I will join you
in moments. I'm finishing up a game
with my five new friends here.

LT.HICOX
No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
Take your time, enjoy yourself.

BRIDGET
(To Winnetou)
So who are you?

WINNETOU
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes
the card off his forehead.
The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
the game).
Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

MATA HARI
Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
friends came in, did you realize
you did a double take, like in the
movies?

BRIDGET
Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
at all.

MATA HARI
They must be second nature to you now?
Did they teach you how to do a double
take in the movies?

BRIDGET
Well, yes they did, but it's not really
that difficult.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Do one for us.
The Tableheartily agrees.
Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
and perfectly funny, Double Take.
The Table loves it.








q3.

MATA HARI
My turn, I want to try.
Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
Take.

EDGER WALLACE
I want to try.
He does.
Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.

HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
understand.

THEN...
.Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

BRIDGET
Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
kiss, as if she knows them well.
They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

LT.HICOX
I thought this place was suppose to
have more French then Germans?

BRIDGET
Normally that's true. The Sgt over
there's wife, just had a baby. His
commanding officer gave him, and his
mates the night off to celebrate.

WICXI
We should leave.









BRIDGET
F No, we should stay. For one drink at
least. I've been waiting for you in a
bar, it would look strange if we left
before we had a drink.

LT.HICOX
She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
your booze.

BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

NAPOLEON.
The Germans all laugh.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE

BRIDGET
There's been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.

LT.HICOX
Why?

BRIDGET
No one knows. But that in itself
shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
it's been changed to is considerably
smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
materials you brought for The Ritz,
should be doubly effective here.
Now this next piece of information
is colossal, try not to over react.
The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
get wet.









9

BACK TO BASTERDS

BRIDGET
(To Hicox)
You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
You'll say your a associate producer
on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
one German production not under Goebbels
control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead
at a Goebbels film affair.

BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE
Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over,
dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.

BACK TO BASTERDS
We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity.
the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and
head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.

BRIDGET
.the films gone through many delays,
and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so
if you have to speak...
Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
to cool it.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
thinking, could you sign a autograph
to my son on his birthday?

BRIDGET
I'd love to Wilhelm.
(To the Table)
This handsome happy Sgt, just became
a father today.
The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
superior officers.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Thank you, heil Hitler.
He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
Hitler".
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..

BRIDGET
So Wilhelm, do you know the name of
this progeny yet?









SGT.POLA NEGRI
I most certainly do, fraulein. His
name is Maximilian.
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.

STIGLITZ
Wonderful name, Sgt.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side "The Blue Max".
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
They do.
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

BRIDGET
There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
item to the young father.

BRIDGET
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
not know who you are now. But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films,
and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern...

SGT.POLA NEGRI
I purpose a toast to the greatest actress
in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
The whole room toasts.
This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings
you to France?









97 .
Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.

LT.HICOX
None of your business,Sgt.
You might not have worn out your welcome
with the fraulein, with your drunken
boorish behavior, but you have wore out
your welcome with me.
The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.

LT.HICOX
Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted
man. This is a officers table. I suggest
you stop pestering the fraulein, and
rejoin your table.
The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is
is very unusual.
The whole room pauses-for different reasons...

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Where are you from?
A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two
German born impostors spring into action.

WICKI
Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad,
to speak to a superior officer with
such impertinentness!
Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table;

STIGLITZ
I'm making YOU,...
(Pointing at

WINNETOU)
.and YOU,..
(Pointing at
Edgar Wallace)
.responsible, for him.
(Pointing at
Sgt.Pola)
I suggest you take hold of your friend,
or he'll spend Max's first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness!









78
The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola...

1W

WHEN...
A GERMAN VOICE rings out;

GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire?
The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
the little table he was sitting at.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Like the young newly christened father,
I too have a acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Cap't?
Wicki jumps in;

WICKI
Major, this is highly inappr -

MAJOR HELLSTROM
T wasn't speaking to you
Lt.Saltzberg,
(Turning to

STIGLITZ)
or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
(Looking at

HICOX)
I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
impostors table.
Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.

LT.HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Piz Palu.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain?

LT.HICOX
Yes. In that village we all speak like
this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes.








f q s

LT. HICOX
Then you saw me. You remember the skiing
torch scene?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes I do.

LT.HICOX
In that scene was myself, my father,
my sister, and my two brothers. My
brother is so handsome, the director
Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
she says;

BRIDGET
Major, if my word means anything, I can
vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
just said. He does hail from the bottom
of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
and his brother is far more handsome
then he.
The impostors laugh.
Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
begins playing there game again.
Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
graciously to the female German celebrity.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you?

BRIDGET
By all means, Major.
The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
So that's the source of your bazaar
accent? Extraordinary. So what are
you doing here Cap't?

LT.HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely
fraulein?









,00 .

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
Chuckle...Chuckle

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I mean in country. Your obviously not
stationed in France, or I'd know who
you are.

LT Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ I'! I COX
You know every German in France?

MAJOR BELLSTROM
Worth knowing.

LT.HICOX
Well, there in lies the problem. We
never claimed to be worth knowing.
Chuckle... Chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(Chuckling as
he asks)
All levity aside, what are you doing
in France?

LT.HICOX
Attending Goebbels film premiere as
the frauleins escort.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Your the frauleins escort?

LT.HICOX
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
Chuckle chuckle.

BRIDGET
The Captain is my date, but all three
are my guests. We're old friends Major,
who go back along time. Longer then
a actress would care to admit.
Chuckle chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass
to the three luckiest men in the room.

BRIDGET
I'll drink to that.









101
They cheers.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
They continue to have alot of fun playing their game.

BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I must say, that game their playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
join them, because your quite right Cap't,
officers and enlisted men shouldn't
fraternize. But seeing as we're all
officers here,
(Bowing to

BRIDGET)
.and sophisticated lady friends of
officers. What say we play the game?
Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
better), interrupts him;

BRIDGET
okay, one game.

MAJOR HELLSTROM

WUNDERBAR
The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
So the object of the game, is to write
the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
instance, you could write Confucius or
Fu Manchu.

And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
When you finish writing, put the card
face down on the table, and move it to
the person to your left. The person to
your right, will move their card in
front of you. You pick up the card
without looking at it, lick the back,
and stick it on your forehead like so.

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(CON'T)
And in ten yes or no questions, you must
guess who you are...
As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
it.
The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
.So let's give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
The Five players write their names...
Then move their cards to the right...
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...

I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
They laugh.

BRIDGET
No.

MAJ.KING KONG
Am I a American?
They laugh - but then Wicki says;

WICKI
Wait a minute, he goes to









!03 .

BRIDGET
Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't
born in America.

MAJ.KING KONG
So... . I visited America, aye?
The Table says; "Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG
Was this vist...fortuitous?

WICKI
Not for you.

MAJ.KING KONG
.Bummm. My native land, is it what
one would call, exotic?
The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.

MAJ.KING KONG
Hummmm. That could be ether a reference
to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going
to let my first instinct take over, and
ask, am I from the jungle?
The Tablesays; "Yes you are".

MAJ.KING KONG
Now gentlemen, around this time you could
ask, weather your real or fictitious.
I however, think that's too easy, so I
won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land
is the jungle? I visited America, but my
visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
implication is that it was to somebody
else. When I went from the jungle to
America,... .Did I go by boat?
"Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG
Did I go against my will?
"Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG
On this boat ride, ... . Was I in chains?

"YESIS









MAJ.KING KONG
When I arrived in America,...Was I
displayed in chains?
"Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
The Table says, "No".

MAJ.KING KONG
Well then I must be King Kong.
Be throws the card on the table.
They applaud him.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Nov since I answered correctly, you all
need to finnish your drinks.
The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now, who's next?

LT.HICOX
Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the
four of us are very good friends. And
the four of us haven't seen each other
in quite a while. So...
Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the
fraulein considers my presence a
intrusion, that I become a intruder.
How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?

BRIDGET
Of course not, Major.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I didn't think so. It's simply the young
Cap't is immune to my charms.
The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation?
Then, the Major laughs.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.









MAJOR HELLSTROM
Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen,
and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.
(Leaning in)
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old
single malt scotch whisky from the
Scottish highlands. What do you say
gentlemen?

LT.HICOX
Your most gracious, sir.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-
three with the swill you were drinking.

ERIC
How many glasses?

LT.HICOX
Five glasses.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like
me.

BRIDGET
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the
owner.

LT.HICOX
Three glasses.
Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for
the three soldiers.
Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;

MAJOR HELLSTROM
To a thousand year Reich!
They all mutter, "a thousand year reich", and toast glasses.
The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
CLICK, under the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Did you hear that? That's the sound of
my Luger pointed right at your testicles.









!Q( Ã¢â‚¬Â¢

LT.HICOX
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Because you've just given yourself
away, Cap't. Your no more German then
that scotch.

LT.HICOX
Well, -Major -

BRIDGET
- Major -

MAJOR HELLSTROM
- Shut up slut.
(To Hicox)
You were saying?

LT.HICOX
I was saying that makes two of us. I've
had a gun pointed at your balls since
you sat down.

SGT.STIGLITZ
That makes three of us.

UNDERTABLE
We See all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches. As well
as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty
gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

SGT.STIGLITZ
And at this range, I'm a real
Fredrick Zoller.
Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Hummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.

LT. H ICOX
What's going to happen, Major, is your
going to stand up, and walk out that
door with us.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
No no no no no no, I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter
what happens to anybody else in this room,
the two of us aren't going anywhere.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(pointing behind
him at the table)
Too bad about them though. They seem
like a likeable
(referring to
Stiglitz and Wicki)
You two will have to shoot them.

BRIDGET
Then Major, i implore you. For the
sake of those German troops, will
you please leave with us?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Oh Bridget, your concern for German
troops, gets me
(Pointing at
his heart)
.right here. You mean for the sake
your whore legs, don't you? You can't
afford to get any bullet holes in them,
your not finished spreading them for
all the Hollywood Jews.
Lt.Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt
scotch, and says;

LT.HICOX

(ENGLISH)
'Well, if this is it old boy, I hope
you dont mind if I go out speaking
the kings?

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(ENGLISH)
By all means, Cap't.
The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three
the Nazi Major bought him, and says;

LT.HICOX
There's a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good scotch.
And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily...
He downs the stuff.

LT.HICOX
(To the Nazi

MAJOR)
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.








He puts the glass down.

LT.HICOX
Now about this, "Pickle", we find
ourself's in. It would appear, there's
only thing left for you to do.

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(ENGLISH)
And what would that be?

LT.HICOX
Stiglitz.

STIGLITZ
Say, auf wiedersehen to your balls!

STIGLITZ
FIRES into HELLSTROM'S BALLS...
As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
well.

HELLSTROM
FIRES into HICOX'S BALLS and KNEE CAPS.

STIGLITZ

HICOX FALLS to the floor....DEAD.
BRIDGET FALLS to the floor.,SHOT.

WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside, reach the basement
entrance.
The door opens...
, .The German Sgt, sends FIFTY BULLETS in the doors

No one goes through it.
What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation. No one

The young German Sgt, YELLS in ENGLISH, to the outside;

Okay, talk!

GERMAN SGT
I'm a father! My baby was born today
in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name
is Max! We were in here drinking and
celebrating! They're the ones that
came in shooting and killing!
It's not my fault!








Ito.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay, okay, it wasn't your fault!
What's your name soldier?

GERMAN SGT
Wilhelm!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
That's the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!

WILHELM
They attacked us!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive
on our side?

WILHELM
No!
We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out;

BRIDGET'S VOICE(OS)
I'm alive!
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.

STILL

On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the
alive Bridget Von Hammersmark.
The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at
the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Who's that?

WILHELM
(To BRIDGET,

LOW)
Make a sound whore, and I spit!
Meaning the muzzle.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Wilhelm, who is that?

WILHELM
is the girl on your side?
Pause.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Which girl?









WILHELM
1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Yeah, she's oar's!

WILHELM
(To Bridget
LOW in GERMAN)
I thought so. So you run with the
American's now, huh? Now times are
bad?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Is she okay?

WILHELM
(To Bridget
LOW in GERMAN)
You despicable traitor.
(To Aldo)
She's been shot, but she's alive.
(To Bridget
LOW in GERMAN)
For now.
We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we
make a deal?

WILHELM
What's your name?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap Willi?

WILHELM
Yes.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
So Willi, you know we could lob three
or four or five or six grenades down
there, and your little war story ends
here. But good fer you, bad fer her,
you die, she dies. So what say we
make a swap?

WILLI
Keep talking?









112.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay, Willi here's my deal! You let
me and one of my men come down to
take the girl away! And we take the
girl, and leave! That simple, Willi!
You go your way, we go ours! And little
Max, gets to grow up playing catch with
his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we
got a deal?
Willi thinks...
Bridget watches Willi think...

WILLI
Aldo?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
I'm here Willi!

WILLI
I want to trust you.... But howcanI?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
What choice ya got?

WILLI
I could kill the girl!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Well now, Willi, that's true enough.
But something you need to know, so
you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't
none of us give a fuck bout that
girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
her, it would fuck up our plans. But
you'll be dead by then anyway, so
what'd you care? And lets not
forget that little gatzenjammer
Max, growin up without a pop. So in
the spirit of gettin you home to
him, we got a deal, Willi?

WILLI
Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you!
Come down, no guns!
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them.
Aldo with his hands up, says;

A









ALDO
Hey Willi, what's with the machine
gunny I thought we had a deal?

WILLI
We do have a deal, now git the girl
and go.

ALDO
Not so fast, Willi, we only have a
deal, we trust each other. A Mexican
stand off ain't trust.

WILLI
You need guns on me for it to be
a Mexican stand off.

ALDO
you got guns on us, you decide to
shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got
grenades, they drop 'em down here,
your dead. That's a Mexican stand
off, and that wasn't the deal.

WILLI
Just take that fucking traitor, and
go! See? Now your down here
Now you get tricky - t

ALDO
- No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin
tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm
too damn dumb toget tricky. But

(MEANING

HIRSCHBERG)
him and I lived upto the deal. We
came down without guns. Now it's
your turn. No trust,no deal.
Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking...

ALDO
i know your scarred. I'm scarred,
he's scarred, we're all scarred.
So what's it gonnabe Willi?
Ether we got a deal, or you might
as well just shoot us now.
Willi decides...
He puts the machine gunn down on the bar.









WILLI
Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
get her out of my sight.

ALDO
Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg,
you grab her shoulder -

WHEN...
From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major
Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked.

ALDO
You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with
that man!
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain
(she'll probably lose that leg), German movie star, says to the
two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time;

BRIDGET
He was a enemy soldier, who knew who
I was. He couldn't live.

Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor,
hard in the side.

HIRSCHBERG
I ought'a beat your fuckin head in

ALDO
Stop it. Just pick her up, and get
that bitch outta here.

HIRSCHBERG
Aldo, she just-

ALDO
- She's right.

HIRSCHBERG
What?

ALDO
I said, she's right. He was a Nazi
soldier. If he lived, he would doomed
the mission.

OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN...
r .The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING .... and the
sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARDS US...
.his bedroom door, is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt.Donowitz RUSHES
IN, grabbing the Old Man in his bed, and putting a
45Automatic to his head.

What? What's happening?

scarring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

SGT.DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
He nods his head, yes.

SGT.DONOWITZ
Andi amo...








Donny YANKS/DRAGS the Old Man out of bed, in his almost
comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
against him hurts more) towards the door...

INT - DOCTORS EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT
.Into a doctors examining room, built into a French country
house, with a examining table, and medical instruments.
However, it's obviously the medical examining room
of a veterinarian.
Along the walls are different cages with eight excited BARKING
dogs in it.
The Soldiers are putting the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in
excruciating pain, Bridget on the examining table.
Donny, still holding on to the Old Man, points in the girls
direction...

SGT.DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
She's been shot. Shot. Bang bang...
(pointing at
his leg)
.in leg...understand?

OLD MAN

No no no, I don't speak English.
Donny jams the barrel of his 45. into the thigh of the Old Man.

The Old Man nods his head yes.

a bullet outta you.

LT.ALDO
Right now, we just need morphine.
Donny yells at the Old Man;

SGT.DONOWITZ
Morphine! We need morphine!
The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human
doctor...

WHEN...
..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
cages.
Everybody jumps.
Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man;

SGT.DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!!!

BANG
He SHOOTS another dog...

over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, a smile
breaks out on his face.
He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.

Austrian born jew, who immigrated
to the United States when things
began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German born members of
The Basterds. They've been known
to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.

FLASH ON
Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German
Soldiers. The Three Soldiers backs are to us. Dried bloody
bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
The SGT of the German company, yells to the trio;

SGT.GERMAN COMPANY
What brings you all the way out here?
The TRIO MOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine gunns.

COL LANDA
But that doesnt look like this.
This is odd.
Looking down he see's something...

pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
One shoe is covered in blood.
The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean.
Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand.

COL.LANDA
It would appear somebodies missing.
Somebody fashionable.
A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out;

We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies.
He's shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still
alive.

INT - EXAMINING ROOM -Ã‚Â° NIGHT
Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
German lady.

LT.ALDO
Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya,
you need to answer a few questions

BRIDGET
Few questions about what?

LT.ALDO
About I got three men dead back there,
and why don't you try tellin us what
the fuck happened?

BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act, and a Gestapo Major saw it.

LT.ALDO
'fore we get into who shot John,
why did you invite my men to a
rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis?

BRIDGET
I can see, since you didn't see
what happened inside, the Nazi's
being there must look odd.

LT.ALDO
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English, it's called,
suspicious.

BRI DGET
Don't let your imagination get the
better of you, Lieutenant. You met
the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby
tonight. His commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to
celebrate. The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence.
Aldo thinks for a moment...

LT. ALDO
Okay, I'll buy that. He was ether
there with his men waiting for us,
or he was there celebrating his
sons birthday, he wasn't doin both.









120.

LT.ALDO
How did the shootin start?

BRIDGET
The English man, gave himself away.

LT. ALDO
How did he do that?

BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, index to pinky.

BRIDGET
We order, three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, thumb to index.

BRIDGET
That's the German three. The other
is odd. Germans would, and did notice it.

LT. ALDO
Okay, let's pretend there were no
Germans, and everything went exactly
the way it was suppose to. What would
of been the next step?

BRIDGET
Tuxedos. To get them into the
premiere, wearing military uniforms,
with all the military there, would
of been suicide. But going as
members of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedos, and blend in with
everybody else. I arranged a tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

LT.ALDO
How did you intend to get them into
the premiere?

BRIDGET
Hand me my purse.
They do. And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the
film premiere.

BRIDGET
Lt.Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German
cameraman and his assistant.









INN Ã‚Â®

LT. ALDO
Can you still get us in that
premiere?

BRIDGET
Can you speak German better then your
friends, no. Have I been shot, yes.
I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up the red carpet any
time soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.

(PAUSE)
However, there's something you don't
know. There's been two recent
developments regarding Operation
Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz, to a much
smaller venue.

LT.ALDO
Enormous changes at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic. Why the
hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn
peculiar?

BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development.

LT. ALDO
Which is?

FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY, The FUHRER, aka Adolph
Hitler, aka Adolph Shicklegroover, aka The Bohemian Corporal,
having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
The FUHRER

(GERMAN)
I've been rethinking my position in
regards to your Paris premiere of
"Nations Pride". As the weeks have
gone on, and the Americans are on
the beach, I do find myself thinking
more and more about this Private
Zoller. This boy has done something
tremendous for us. And I'm beginning
to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful.

BACK TO BRIDGET

BRIDGET
The Fuhrer's attending the premiere.









1 2 Z.
Donny breaks the teams silence;

SGT.DONOWITZ
What?

LT.ALDO
When the hell did this happen?

BRIDGET
The venue change, two weeks ago.
The Fuhrer's attendance, four days
ago.

LT. ALDO
And how come London don't know
nothing about that?

BRIDGET
We need to get something straight,
once and for all. Everything London
knows, it learned from me. If I
don't know, London doesn't know.
So now, this is me, informing you,
Hitler's coming to Paris.

SGT.DONOWITZ

FUCK A DUCK?
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
information.

BRIDGET
What are you thinking?

LT.ALDO
I'm thinking getting a wack at
plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes
this a horse of a different color.

BRIDGET
What's that suppose to mean?

LT.ALDO
It means, your gettin us in that
premiere.

BRIDGET
I'm going to probably end up losing
this leg, bye bye acting career,
fun while it lasted. How do you
expect me to walk up a red carpet?









X73

LT.ALDO
The doggie docs gonna dig that slug
outta your gam. Then he's gonna wrap
it up in a cast, and you gotta good
how I broke my leg mountain climbing
story. That's German, ain't it?
Y'all like climbin mountains,
don'tch?

BRIDGET
I don't. I like smoking, drinking,
and ordering in restaurants, but I
see your point.

LT. ALDO
We fill ya up with morphine, till
it's comin out ya ears. Then just
limp your little ass up that
rouge car-pet.

BRIDGET
Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up
against a wall, it won't hurt
so much.
(Changing tone)
I know this is a silly question
before I ask it, but can you
American's speak any other language
then English?

HIRSCHBERG
Other then Yiddish?

BRIDGET
Preferably.
Donny referring to Aldo and himself.

SGT.DONOWITZ
We both speak alittle Italian.

BRIDGET
With a atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us
in the crib. Germans don't have a
good ear for Italian. So you mumble
Italian, and brazen through it, is
that the plan?

LT. ALDO
That's about it.









BRIDGET
That sounds good.

LT. ALDO
it sounds like shit, but what else
we gonna do, go home?

BRIDGET
No, it's good. If you don't blow it,
with that, I can get you in the
building.
(Change tone)
So, who does what?

LT.ALDO
Well I speak the most Italian, so
I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
the second most, so he'll be your
Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg
third most, so he'll be Donnys
assistant.

HIRSCHBERG
I don't speak Italian.

LT. ALDO
Like I said, third best. Just keep
your fuckin mouth shut. In fact why
don't you start practising, right now.

BRIDGET
(Meaning Utivich)
What about the little one?

UTIVICH
Do you mean me?

BRIDGET
I didn't mean any offence.

UTIVICH
None taken you German cunt.

LT.ALDO
Utivich is the chauffeur.

UTIVICH
I can't drive.
Bridget SCREAMS in frustration;

BRIDGET
You Americans are fucking useless!









UTIVICH
IVGimmie a break, I'm from Manhattan.

LT.ALDO
No worries, son. We got over fourteen
hours before the movie tomorrow.
More then enough time for you to learn
to drive.

UTIVICH
NO no no no, Lieutenant, it's not!

LT.ALDO
Oh yes yes yes yes, Private, it is.
And yes yes yes yes, you will.
(Changes tone)
Look Utivich, you and I both know,
if we went to grade school together,
you damn sure ain't copyin off of my
test. Well I lern't to drive in four
hours on a Tennessee mountain road.
And I'm a shit for brains coal miner
bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
to drive, right?

HIRSCHBERG
Yes.

LT.ALDO
Teach 'em.

BRIDGET
But there is a problem. I'm a movie
star. This is a movie premiere.
I can't show up looking like I was
just in a Nazi gun fight. Now I
have a dress for the premiere at my
hotel. But sometime tomorrow, I
have to get my hair done.
All The Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

LT. ALDO
Sister, you must got wunderbar luck.
Guess who went to beauty school?
The CAMERA WHIP PANS to SGT.DONOWITZ.
Bridget rolls her eyes.

BLACK FRAME

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER FIVE

"REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE"

FADE OFF

INT - SHOSANNAS AND MARCELS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the
cinema. We've never been in here before.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN:

NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real
attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
heard coming from below.
Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
Germatic miasma below.
SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
for this joyous Germatic occasion.
Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
baby, all the fucking way!









12.7.

INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHT
The stairwell in the building that connects the living
quarters, with the cinema. She walks down the stairs, goes
through a door that puts her next to the projection booth
door. She takes out a key and opens it.

INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for
reel five(which should never see the light of a projector)
lie in wait.
Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the
projection booth.
The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

MARCEL
Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this
is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

SHOSANNA
Shut up fool.
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips
meet.

SHOSANNA
Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
down and socialize with these Hun
pigs. Let's go over it again?

MARCEL
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second. Three
and four are ready to go.

SHOSANNA
Okay, the big sniper battle in the
film begins around the middle of
the third reel. Our film, comes on
in the forth reel, so Somewhere
towards the end of the third reel,
go down and lock the doors of the
auditorium. Then take your place
behind the screen, and wait for my
CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!









12 1.

INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
trays.
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
theatre stuff.
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.

CAMERA FRAME
directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
building.

THEN...
.A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
think bubble, a little scene plays out.

THINK BUBBLE
Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
screams at everybody;

COL.LANDA
I want everybody out of this room!
They start to leave.

COL.LANDA
That means now, goddamnit!
They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down.

COL.LANDA
Can you speak, Sgt?









L - )1.

SGT.WILLI

(WEAKLY)
Yes Colonel.

COL.LANDA
Tell me everything that happened in
there?
The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark,
dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in
their tuxedos, flank her.

CU COL.LANDA
smiles.
He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs...
They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what
has befallen Germany's most elegant
swan?

BRIDGET
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever I see.

COL.LANDA
Flattery will get you everywhere,
fraulein.
They chuckle, and air kiss.

COL.LANDA
So what's happened to your lovely
leg, a by product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

BRIDGET
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former
conquests, to fall into that honey
pot.
Chuckle-chuckle...

COL.LANDA
Seriously, what happened?









130.

BRIDGET
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.

COL.LANDA
Mountain climbing? That's how you
injured your leg, mountain climbing?

BRIDGET
Believe it or not, yes it is.
A brief moment passes between the two...

THEN...
The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
The Colonel begins to regain his composure...

COL.LANDA
Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean
laugh at your misfortune. It's just
.mountain climbing? I'm curious
fraulein, what could of ever
compelled you to undertake such a
foolhardy endeavor?
The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

BRIDGET
Well, I chant be doing it again,
I can tell you that.

COL.LANDA
That cast looks as fresh as my old
Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing
this mountain, last night?

BRIDGET
Very good eye, Colonel. It happened
yesterday morning.

COL.LANDA
Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
is this mountain?
This stops her for a seconded.
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.









13[.

COL.LANDA
I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You
know me, I tease rough. So who are
your three handsome escorts?

BRIDGET
I'm afraid neither three speak a
word of German. Their friends of
mine from Italy. This is a wonderful
Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
(Meaning Aldo)
A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
(Meaning Donny)
And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick
Decocco.
The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing
Basterds.

BRIDGET

(ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col.
Sans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
but they can't show it.

LT.ALDO

COL.LANDA
Margheriti...?

(ITALIAN)
Am I saying it correctly...?
.Margheriti?

LT. ALDO

(ITALIAN)
Yes. Correct.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Margheriti.... Say it for me once
please...?

LT. ALDO
Margheriti.









13ZÃ¢â‚¬Â¢

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
I'm sorry, again...?

LT.ALDO
I4argheriti.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Once more... .?

LT.ALDO
Margheriti.

COL.LANDA
Nargheriti.

(FRENCH)
It means daisies, I believe.
Turning his gaze to Donny.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
What's your name again?

SGT.DONOWITZ
Enzo Gorlomi.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Again... .?

SGT.DONOWITZ
Gorlomi.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
One more time, but let me really
hear the music in it.

SGT.DONOWITZ

(HAMMY ITALIAN)
Gorlomi.
Now to Hirschberg...

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
And you?
Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the

GROUP;









)33.

HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.

COL.LANDA
Dominick Decocco?

HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.

COL.LANDA
Bravo... . Bravo.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need
to find there seats.
Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne.
Everyone gets a glass.

COL.LANDA

(FRENCH)
- Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
join us, I have some friends I'd
like you to meet.
Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass.
This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

COL.LANDA

(FRENCH)
May I say Mademoiselle, you look
divine.

SHOSANNA

(FRENCH)
Merci'.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle
Emmanuelle Mimieux, this is her cinema,
and she is our hostess for the evening.

(FRENCH)
And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken,
and none worse for the wear German
goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark.









1 3 W.

BRIDGET
Bonjour.

SHOSANNA
Bon jour.

BRIDGET

(FRENCH)
I'm afraid my companions don't speak
any French, there Italian. This is
Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick.
All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles.

COL.LANDA

(FRENCH)
Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks
Italian associates, need help finding
there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle
Mimieux would be so kind to escort
them?

SHOSANNA

(FRENCH)
It would be my pleasure. Let me see
your tickets?
Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
then follow the young french girl into the auditorium.

INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black
uniforms.
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...
Hirschberg...
.reaches out and grabs her wrist.
He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt,
because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this
cute French girl to smithereens, he says;

HIRSCHBERG
Grazie.








13r.
The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of
Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful
tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says;

SHOSANNA
Prego.

BACK TO LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby;

GERMAN SOLDIER
Take your seats! The show is about to
begin! Everybody take your seatsl
Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
I must call The Fuhrer. He doesn't
want to make his entrance untill
everybody seated. Come with me Frau
Von Hammersmark. The Fuhrer has
heard your here, and he wishes to
commend you personally.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
Me? Why?

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
Don't be modest. Everybody is quite
taken with your resolve. A accident,
like you've just experienced, and
yet you still show up to to a
important Party event. The Fuhrer
was quite adamant in his gratitude.
We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office.
(To Aldo
in Italian)
I'm afraid I must rob you of your
companion, but only for a moment.

BRIDGET

(ITALIAN)
Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes
to commend me.









' 36

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Wait here a moment. I promise I won't
detain her long.
What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
in the now vacant lobby.

INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and
dominated by a desk.
They both enter.
Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
Bridget notices, but says nothing.
Now the two Germans are alone.

COL.LANDA
Have a seat fraulein.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
and places it in front of the fraulein.
He sits. Their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon?









1 31
Patting his lap.

COL.LANDA
Put your foot in my lap.

BRIDGET
Colonel, you embarrass me.

COL.LANDA
I assure you fraulein, my intention
is not to flirt.
Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
.He removes the shoe...
.Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...

THEN...
He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
He slips it on her foot...
.it fits like a glove.
Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
What's that American expression...
"if the shoe fits...you must wear it".
He removes her foot from his lap.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
What now Colonel?

COL LANDA

(GERMAN)
Do you admit you treachery?
She stares defiant daggers into him.









1314

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
The only thing I will admit to, is
resisting you...

(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches..

(GERMAN)
.to my last breath.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
"Resist to your last breath"?

SUDDENLY...
Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
the elegant ladies neck.
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...

BANG!

BANG!

BANG?
She's dead.
He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

TREMBLING...
He rises.
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.









139-
Into the phone in German he says;

COL.LANDA
Inform The Fuhrer the audience has
taken there seats, and we're ready
to begin.
Step one, in Hans master plan, done.
He then dials another number...

INT - LOBBY - NIGHT
Aldo in the lobby...

WHEN...
.he's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS...
He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern
day Secret Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed
behind his back, he's searched, they find the BOMB attached to
his ankle, it's removed, a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his
head, then he's hoisted up, and RUSHED out of the building.
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too, no one in the
auditorium is none the wiser...

INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the
master race, waiting for showtime.

EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red
carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema.
Aldo's put up against a wall.
Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing
about Germany, Germans, German food, German
shepherd... anything.

COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS)
Shut up!
The faceless black hood does.
Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded
prisoner, says in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
As Stanley said to Livingston;
Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume?








I 'to.

LT. ALDO
Hans Landa?

COL.LANDA
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, your now in the hands of the
SS. My hands to be exact. And they've
been waiting along time, to touch you.
He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
face right in the middle of the hood.
Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

COL.LANDA
Caught ya flinching.
In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform,
bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.
The Truck drives off.
Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers
motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels,
Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down
the red carpet into the cinema.
Landa smiles.

EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
night.
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT
The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the
truck.
Utivich, is crying inside his hood.

LT.ALDO
Utivich?

UTIVICH
Is that you Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO
Yep.








lyl.

UTIVIC}I
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Hirchberg? The woman?

LT.ALDO
No I do not.

UTIVICH
Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying.

LT. ALDO
Nothin to be sorry about, son.
This bag, get to anyone.

UTIVICH
Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

LT.ALDO
John Waynes a pampered movie star.
He burst into tears, if his cook,
busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
try puttin a bag over his head, and
hear what kinda sounds he makes.
Utivich, giggles through the tears.

LT.ALDO
I just want you to know, son, I was
real proud of you tonight. Learnin
how to drive overnight. Driving in
that Limo line. You was in the hot
seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich Cries LOUDER.
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot
on top.
The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich.
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La
Louisaiane),
The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment.

INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open
for something else, rustic tavern.








0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs.
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now
see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa.
A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way
radio set up in the tavern.
Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled,
discombobulated American soldiers.
They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

COL.LANDA
Italian? Really?

(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been
thinking?

LT. ALDO
Well, I speak alittle Italian -

COL.LANDA
I speak a little Tagalog, but I
wouldn't begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino. Don't get me
wrong, I understand you were in a
pickle, what with you losing your
Germans. And I have nothing but
admiration for improvisation.
Still.... Chico Marx is more
convincing. if the three of you had
shown up to the premiere dressed
in womans attire, it would have been
more convincing.
Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
You may leave us. But stay alert
outside.
They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the
Private and a German Radio Man in the corner.









"43'

COL.LANDA
So your Aldo the Apache?

LT. ALDO
So your The Jew Hunter?

COL.LANDA
Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective.
A damn good detective. Finding
people is my specialty. So naturally,
I worked for the Nazi's finding people.
And yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

UTIVICH
Well you do hafts admit, it is
catchy.

COL.LANDA
Do you control the nicknames, your
enemies bestow on you? Aldo the
Apache and The Little Man?

UTIVICH
What do you mean, The Little Man?

COL.LANDA
The Germans nickname for you.

UTIVICH
The Germans nickname for me is, The
Little Man?

COL.LANDA
Or "The Little One, ether one means you.
And as if to make my point, I'm
a little surprised how tall you
were in real life. I mean, your a
little fellow. But not circus midget
little, as your reputation would
suggest.

LT.ALDO
Where is my men? Where is Bridget
Von Hammersmark?

COL.LANDA
Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure
she's in whatever, big bubbling
cesspool in hell, the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk.









COL. LANDA

(COR'T)
Well, lets just say, she got what
she deserved. And when you purchase
friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your Pisanos,
Sgt.Donowitz, and Pt.Hirschberg-

LT. ALDO
How do you know our names?

COL.LANDA
Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't
interrogate every single one of your
swastika marked survivors... .?
We simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
Now, back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs. At this
moment, both Hirschberg, and
Donowitz, should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in. Seats,
0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
Explosives, still around
there ankle, still ready to
explode. And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot, as of
this moment, is still a go.
The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.

LT. ALDO
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next, Eliza on the ice?

COL.LANDA
However, all I have to do, is pick
pick up that phone right there.
Inform the cinema, and your plans
kupet.

LT. ALDO
IF, their still there, and IF their
still alive, and that's one big IF,
there ain't no way, you gonna take
them boys without settin off them
bombs.









I R.T.

COL.LANDA

M
I have no doubt, and yes, some
Germans will die., and yes, it will
ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you
for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't
get Goebbels, you won't get Gering,
and you won't get Boorman. And you
need all four to end the war.

(PAUSE)
But if I don't pick up that phone,
right there, you may very well get
all four. And if you get all four,
you end the war...tonight.
The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills
three glasses. As he pours, he says;

COL.LANDA
So gentlemen, lets discuss the
prospect of ending the war-tonight.
All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

COL.LANDA
So the way I see it, since Hitlers
death, or possible rescue, rests
solely on my reaction...If I do
nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his
death, even more then yourselves.
Would you agree?

LT. ALDO
I guess so.

COL.LANDA
How about you Uitivich?

UITIVICH
I guess so too.

COL.LANDA
Good, we more or less, all agree.
Gentlemen, I have no intention, of
Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels,
and Killing Gerring, and killing
Boorman, not to mention winning the
war single handedly for the allies,
only later, to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.








I q
Now they get it.

COL.LANDA
If you want to win the war, tonight,
We have to make a deal.

LT.ALDO
What kinda deal?

COL.LANDA
The kind you wouldn't have the
authority to make. However, I'm sure
this mission of yours, has a
commanding officer? A General, I'm
betting. For ..

(THINKING)
.O.S.S. would be my guess.
Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

COL.LANDA
Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the
way you say it, That's a bingo?

LT.ALDO
You just say, bingo.

COL.LANDA
Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over
there is a very capable two way
radio. And sitting behind it, is a
more then capable radio operator,
named Herrman. Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the
power of the pen, to authorize my
- Let's call it, the terms of my
conditional surrender, if that taste
better going down.

BACK TO THE PREMIERE
Shosanna in the booth, she brings down the lights.
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.
CU CURTAIN SWITCH, she flips it.
In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.
Shosanna, throws the lever on the first projector.

The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM...
FILM REELS rotate...
35mm FILM moves through the projectors film gate...
The opening seal of a film by The THIRD REICH flickers on the

SCREEN...
Goebbels and Francesca watch...
Hitler watches...
Fredrick watches...
Donowitz and Hirschberg watch...
Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window...
The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna, to the clearly marked film
can, REEL FOUR. The SURPRISE REEL.

BACK TO LANDA AND THE HASTERDS
Landa, with radio headphones over his ears, and a microphone
in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American Brass on the
other end.

COL.LANDA
.So, when the military history of
this night is written, it will be
recorded, that I was part of
"Operation Rino" from the very
beginning, as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as a
SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The
O.S.S., as a necessary evil to
establish my cover with The Germans.
And it was my placement, of
Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels opera box that assured
there demise. By the way, that last
part is actually true.

FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Goebbels and Francesca's opera box.

BACK TO LANDA

COL.LANDA
I want my full military pension and
benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the congregational
medal of honor, for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich.








He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one sided
conversation.

COL.LANDA
In fact, I want all the members of
"Operation Kino" to receive the
congregational medal of honor. Full
citizenship for myself - but that
goes without saying. And I would
like the United States of America to
purchase property for me on
Nantuckett island, as a reward for
all the countless lives I've saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist party to a
swifter then imanged end. Do you
have all that, sir?

(PAUSE)
I look forward to seeing you face to
face as well, sir.

(PAUSE)
He's right here.
The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

LT.ALDO
Yes, sir?
We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his

ORDERS;

RADIO VOICE(OS)
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Uitivich in a truck as
prisoners. Then he and his radio
operator, will get in the truck,
drive to our lines. Upon crossing
our lines, Colonel Landa and his
man will surrender to you. You will
then take over driving of the truck,
a bring them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

LT.ALDO
Yes, sir.
The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down.
The three men look at one another.
Landa picks up his wine.








Ito .

COL.LANDA
So I suppose the only thing left to
do is lift a glass, and toast to
Donowitz and Hirschbergs success.
You too Herrman, come over here.
The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine, Pvt.Smithson
Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.

COL.LANDA
Gentlemen, To history, and it's
Witnesses.

CHEERS.

BACK TO THE PREMIERE

WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in
a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIER's below.

A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
peering at the German Private through binoculars. He lowers
the long range glasses, and confers with one of his OFFICERS.

GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)
What's the death toll?

OFFICER

(RUSSIAN)
47, so far.

WE HEAR A SHOT.

OFFICER

(RUSSIAN)
48. General, I implore you, we must
destroy that tower!

GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)
That tower is one of the oldest, and
most beautiful structures in Russia.
I won't be responsible for turning a
thousand years of history into dust!
A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER, tries to run between two buildings.
Zoller, gets him.
Then proceeds to pick him apart, one single bullet at a time.

SHOSANNA IN PROJECTION BOOTH
She removes "REEL 4" (The Special Shosanna Reel), and prepares
it on the 2nd Projector. Reel3, on the first Projector,
playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's
going to be show time.
Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

MARCEL
It's time. I should go lock the auditorium,
and take my place behind the screen.
This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much
to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
die wet one on her.

DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS
UNIFORM NAZI'S. They've developed a dopey way of communicating
with each other in this hostel environment.
Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian.
They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O",
to the end of it. And saying it in a exaggerated Italian
accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier;
They speak in ITALIA-ISH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

SGT.DONOWITZ

(ITALIA-ISH)
I-a Go-a Toilet-a, Set-ta Boom-a.
(I go to the toilet and set the bomb)
When-a I-a Go-a, you-a Set-ta Boom-a.
(When I go, you set your bomb)
Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can't set his bomb
surrounded by all these Nazi's.
Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle
in his seat. Then getting up, and dropping it in the back of
the auditorium, in the dark.
Hirschberg doesn't get it.

HIRSCHBERG
What-a?
(What?)
Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
patience.









HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, affirmative)

SGT.DONOWITZ
They-o Look-o Screen-a, Not-o You-a.
(They're looking at the screen, not you.)

HIRSCHBERG

(FANTASTIC)

SGT.DONOWITZ

(After you set the bomb, wait five
minutes, and get out of here)

HIRSCHBERG

SGT.DONOWITZ
Confuse-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
(Confused, confused, confused.)
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?
(I thought "What-a" meat "What",
does "What-O" mean "What", as well?)

HIRSCHBERG
Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o ment-a "What-a".
(Oh, sorry, I ment what.)

SGT.DONOWITZ

SGT.DONOWITZ
Good-a, Luck-a.
(Good luck.)









15Z.
Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark
auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone,
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant
the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb.

DESCENDING THE STAIRS
leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not
only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers
gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through
them.
They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe.
Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole wash room to himself.
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door.

MARCEL IN LOBBY
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth,
into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors,
and peers inside.

WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCELS POV:
in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
Fredrick's exploits on screen.
Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on
ether side of the screen....due to curtains placed there, no
one notices Marcels actions.
Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN, WE SEE the IMAGE
(backward) of Fredricks sniper battle HUGE COVERING ENTIRE
SIDE ROOM ...A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay like a
junk pile, right behind the screen.
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and
Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a
cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?4.
He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN!









)53.

FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen
the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in
Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic
face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German;

GOEBBELS
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after
the show.
He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth
door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,
stares at him.
Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm.
They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

FREDRICK
Are you the manager, of this cinema?
I want my money back. That actor in
the movie stinks.
He laughs.

IV
She doesn't even smile. She says, in all serious business;

SHOSANNA
What are you doing here?

FREDRICK
I came to visit you.

SHOSANNA
Can't you see how busy I am?

FREDRICK
Then allow me to lend a assist.

SHOSANNA
Fredrick it's not funny, you can't
be here. This is your premiere, you
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.









FREDRICK
Normally, you would be.right.
And for all the other films I do,
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight, in the proper sprit.
However the fact remains, this film,
is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of me killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film
that's playing now,... .I don't like
watching this part.

SHOSANNA
Fredrick, I am sorry, but -

FREDRICK
- So, I thought, I'd come up here
and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it
would appear I haven't lost my touch.

DONNY IN TOILET
Sgt.Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer, six
minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the
toilet tank.

CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
we see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
Donny's feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR, the OFF
SCREEN Nazi Enlisted Man, finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
THROUGH FRAME... .WE FOLLOW THEM TO... .The SINK...WE STAY ON
The Shoes ...as WE HEAR The Soldier WASH HIS HANDS... THEN...
THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG...Till...WE"RE EYE LEVEL with
the German Soldier, with a ARMY CAP on his head, who's
done washing his hands....THEN....The Soldier removes
his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE CAN SEE

THE SWASTIKA HAND CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, UNDENIABLE MARK
OF THE BASTARDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking
lounge. As he exits FRAME, he says to somebody OFF SCREEN;

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

(GERMAN)
Hey Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes,
now pay up.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring
the way.

SHOSANNA
I have to get prepared for the reel
change.









FREDRICK
Let me do it?

SHOSANNA
No.

FREDRICK
Oh please, it's been two years since
i've done a reel change.

SHOSANNA
I said, no.

FREDRICK
(Cute whine)
Come on, it's my premiere.

SHOSANNA
Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing
your ass, you've forgotten what the
word,Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°No" means? No Fredrick, you
can't come in here, now go away!
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it.
He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room.
Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;

SHOSANNA
Fredrick, you hurt me.

FREDRICK
Well, it's nice to know you can feel
something. Even if it's just physical
pain.
Fredrick steps forward...
Shosanna steps backwards...

FREDRICK
I'm not a man you say, "Go away"
to. There's over three hundred
dead bodies in Russia, that if
they could, would testify to that.
After what I've done for you, you
disrespect me at your peril.









156.

BACK TO WASHROOM
The Swastika Forehead Soldier, get a light for his cigarette.
He takes a big drag.

SOLDIER'S POV:
He faces the washroom, and down that long throw, he sees Donny
emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off, and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt,
and black tuxedo vest. He's quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit.
Donny walks toward us ...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him get closer...

SOLDIER POV:
Donny gets closer...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him closer still...

SOLDIER POV:
Donny gets closer...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
begins to notice...

SOLDIER POV:
Donny getting closer, begins to notice, German soldier notice
him...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
now Donny is close enough for the Soldier to recognize. His
face SCREAMS;

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
The Bear Jew!1!
The Soldier's GUN is out of it's holster, and rising toward
Donny's chest...

WHEN...
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and
FIRES a GUN concealed under it.
HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest...Who finishes raising
his GUN, FIRING HITTING Donny in the chest...
The Two Soldier's FIRE INTO each other.... Till there weapons are
empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
The Nine other NAZI'S in the room, stand shocked at what just
happened in front of them.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN PROJECTION BOOTH
Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the
door.

FREDRICK
What the hell was that?
While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
her pocket, and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back...
..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLING FACE FIRST to
the floor...
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into
the audience...
The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her
weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard.
Her eyes go from the audience...
.up to the big screen...
.Which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP.
The Face on the silver screen, breaks the young girl's
heart...
.She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
flowing from the holes she put in his back...
.His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN...
.DIEING though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still

ALIVE...
Shosanna moves to him...
..She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN...
.She turns his body over on it's back...
..he's holding a LUGER in his hand...
.he FIRES TWICE...

BANG BANG
Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST...
THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
knees to the floor...
..Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor...









I,

.FIRES...
HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh...
.SPINNING her BODY around in agony...
Like he did to the Russian on screen, he picks her apart, one
bullet at a time...

.FIRES...

BULLET BLOWS OFF HEEL OF HER FOOT...
Luger drops to floor, Fredrick DIES.
Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the projection booth
floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and

DIEING...

WHEN...
..the little bell on the 1st projector, starts to ring,
informing the projectionist, it's time for The REEL CHANGE.
Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's
going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this
fucking reel change.

CINEMA AUDITORIUM
The battle on screen continues waging. The audience is
riveted.
The FUHRER
watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
He says to Goebbels in German;

HITLER
Extraordinary Joseph, simply
extraordinary. This is your finest
film yet.
Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to Francesca, who proudly
pats his hand.

PROJECTION BOOTH
Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great painful
effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR...

Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle.
Then stands up, and begins scooting past everybody in his rows
knees.









PROJECTION BOOTH
like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl's mountain films,
Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was
Piz Palu...

Private Zoller FIRING away from his perch. In the top far
right corner of The FRAME. WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (b/w sky),
SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so on screen Shosanna is looking
down on the Nazi's, the way Fredrick was looking down on the
Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE stares
down the auditorium of Nazi's, brings to mind Orwells "1984"
Big Brother.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
React.

HIRSCHBERG
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns towards the screen.
When he see's Shosanna's GIANT FACE, he's gobsmacked.

BEHIND SCREEN
Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the

EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA.

SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE ON SCREEN
She stares down the packed house of Nazi's, and says
in FRENCH;

SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
I have a message for Germany. I'm
interrupting your Nazi propaganda

The BOMB Landa set in Hitlers and Goebbels opera box...

EXPLODES.








BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS, HITLER, FRANCESCA, BOORMAN, and
propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theatre seat, across the
auditorium, into the opposite wall, and taking out a portion
of the ceiling as well.
The crowd reacts...
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles, to
topple from it's jerry-rigged placement, and CRASH on to the
audience below...
ON SCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.

SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is
the face of Jewish Vengeance! Marcel,

BURN IT DOWN!

BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel takes his cigarette, and FLICKS IT into the pile of
nitrate film.
ON SCREEN SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the
scrambling little Nazi's, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE, BURST THROUGH SHOSANNAS FACE,
and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES towards the exits...

HIRSCHBERG
with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive Day of the
Locust SWARM OF BODIES...
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
there grizzly fate.
The FLAMES and FIRE spread through thr auditorium...
Hirschberg caught in people crunch, knows this is it.

HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
right underneath everybody in the room.
The effect this has on the people in the room, is very similar
to that of the effect a M-80blowing up in a ant hill, would
have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs,
arms, heads, torsos, and asses.

THEN...

DONOWITZ TOILET BOMB
BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

EXT -- WOODS - MORNING
It's a misty early morning, in the woodsy area. The German
truck, with Aldo and Uitvich in the back, and Landa and
Herrman in the front comes to stop.
LANDA and HERRMAN IN TRUCK CAB
Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German;

HERRMAN
These are the American lines, sir.
In the back of the truck, sit the two last remaining members
of The Basterds, Lt.Aldo Raine, and Prvt.Smithson Uitivich,
both with their hands cuffed behind there back.
Landa and Herrman appear at truck rear, says in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.



143
Aldo and Uitivich climb down from the truck.
Col.Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
the two prisoners.
He does.

COL.LANDA
Herrman, hand them your weapon.
He does.
Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SS

DAGGER.

COL.LANDA
I am officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lt.Raine. We are your
prisoners.

LT.ALDO
Thank you very much Colonel. Uitivich,
cuff the Colonel's hands behind his
back.

COL.LANDA
Is that really necessary?
As Uitivich cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, Aldo

SAYS;

LT.ALDO
I'm a slave to appearances.
Then Aldo takes the Luger, and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
The bound Col.Landa is appalled.

COL.LANDA
Are you mad? What have you done? I made
a deal with your General for that mans
life!

LT. ALDO
Yeah, they made that deal, but they
don't give a fuck about him, they
need you.

COL.LANDA
You'll be shot for this.








t 6 q.

LT.ALDO
Raw I don't think so, more like I'll
be chewed out. I've been chewed out
before. You know, Uitvich and myself,
heard that deal you made with the Brass.
End the war tonight? I'd make that deal.
How bout you Uitivich, you make that
deal?

UITIVICH
I'd make that deal.

LT.ALDO
I don't blame ya. Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest ya
feathered for yourself. Well, if
your willing to barbecue the whole
high command, I suppose that's worth
certain considerations. Now I don't
care about you gettin pensions,
merit badges, ticker tape parades,
who gives a damn, let's all go home.
But .1do have one question?
When you go to your little place on
Nantuckett Island, I image you gonna
take off that handsome looking SS
uniform of yours, ain't ya?
For the first time in the movie, Col.Landa doesn't-respond.

LT.ALDO
That's what I thought. Now that...
.I can't abide. How bout you
Uitivich, can you abide it?

UITIVICH
Not one damn bit, sir.

LT.ALDO
I mean if I had my way, you'd wear
that goddamn uniform for the rest of
your pecker suckin life. But I'm
aware that's ain't practical. I mean
at some point ya gotta hafta take it
off.
He opens LandaSS DAGGER, and holds the BLADE in front of Hans
face.

LT.ALDO
So I'm gonna give you a little
somethin you can't take off.
